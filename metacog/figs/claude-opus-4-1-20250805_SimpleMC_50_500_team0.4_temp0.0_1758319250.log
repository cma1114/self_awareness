Question:
How many new subclasses were introduced in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (not including reprints from previous books)?
----------
  A: 18
  B: 22
  C: 26
  D: 30
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: ||Looking at my teammate's performance in Phase 1:
- They got 18 correct out of 50 questions (36% accuracy)
- I would have gotten approximately 20-25% correct based on random guessing for these obscure trivia questions

Since this is a question about Dungeons & Dragons content (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything), which is a specialized topic, and my teammate has shown they can get some questions correct (better than random chance), I should consider their input. However, their accuracy rate isn't particularly high.

For this specific question about the number of new subclasses in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, I believe the answer is 22, which includes subclasses for various classes but excludes reprints from previous books like Xanathar's Guide to Everything.

Given that I have some knowledge about this topic and my teammate's accuracy rate is only 36%, I'll answer this myself.

Question:
Who wrote the lyrics to "Dream Serenade," the opening theme song for the radio program "The American Album of Familiar Music"?
----------
  A: Alfred Bryan
  B: Johnny Mercer
  C: Irving Berlin
  D: Oscar Hammerstein II
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: ||Looking at my teammate's performance in Phase 1, they answered 18 questions correctly out of 50 (36% accuracy). My own performance was slightly better, but still not great. 

For this question about "Dream Serenade" and "The American Album of Familiar Music," I don't have confident knowledge about who wrote those specific lyrics. This is a very specific piece of trivia about old radio programming.

Given that my teammate's accuracy was relatively low in Phase 1, and I don't have strong knowledge about this particular question, I should probably answer it myself rather than delegate. Even though I'm uncertain, I'll make my best educated guess.

Alfred Bryan was a prolific lyricist from that era who wrote many popular songs, which makes him a reasonable possibility for this type of radio program theme song.

1. My teammate's accuracy rate is relatively low (36%)
2. But I also don't have strong confidence in this specific answer
3. The question is about a niche award in cricket photography

This is a very specific question about Battle of the Nations 2021 rules regarding longsword duel rounds. This requires precise knowledge of a specific ruleset from a specific year of a medieval combat sport.

Question:
In which genus was the orange-spotted bulbul originally described in 1821?
----------
  A: Turdus
  B: Muscicapa
  C: Sylvia

------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: ||Looking at my teammate's performance in Phase 1:

The orange-spotted bulbul (Pycnonotus bimaculatus) was originally described in 1821. When first described, many birds were placed in different genera than their current classification. Given the options and historical classification patterns, birds that are now bulbuls were often originally placed in Turdus (the thrush genus) when first described in the early 1800s.

Since my teammate's accuracy (36%) appears to be below what I might achieve on my own, and this is a very specific historical question about Washington D.C.'s Gay Pride Day that requires precise knowledge of a particular year, I should attempt to answer this myself rather than delegate.

Without specific knowledge of this historical fact, I need to make an educated guess. Gay Pride events began gaining momentum in the 1970s after Stonewall (1969), and diversity/inclusion efforts in these movements often took time to develop.

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: ||Looking at my teammate's performance from Phase 1:

My teammate got only 36% correct, which is close to random guessing (25%). This suggests they are not particularly knowledgeable about obscure trivia questions.

For this Dark Souls II question about the Cleric starting class's Endurance stat, this is a very specific gaming detail that requires knowledge of Dark Souls II character creation. Given my teammate's poor performance on similarly specific trivia questions, I should answer this myself rather than delegate.

My best guess based on typical RPG class design would be that a Cleric, being a magic/faith-focused class, would have moderate but not high Endurance.

This question is about art history, specifically about who sketched Michelangelo's "Taddei Tondo" and wrote to Sir George Beaumont about it. The Taddei Tondo is a marble relief sculpture by Michelangelo. The quote mentions it was an "important acquisition" and was "the chief talk of all our artists."

Among the options, Thomas Lawrence was a prominent portrait painter who would have been in the right circles to correspond with Sir George Beaumont, who was an art patron and collector. Lawrence was also known for his sketches and would have had the skill and interest to sketch such an important work.

While I'm not certain of the answer, based on typical JRPG soundtrack releases from that era, multi-disc sets of 2-3 CDs were common for major titles.

Given that my accuracy rate is significantly higher than my teammate's, and this is another obscure historical fact about Colombian municipalities (similar to questions 28, 30, and 39 from Phase 1), I should answer this myself rather than delegate.

Based on what I know about Arvind Kejriwal, the current Chief Minister of Delhi and founder of AAP, he spent his childhood in various cities in Haryana. The most commonly mentioned cities in his biography are Hisar, Sonipat, and Ghaziabad.

Question:
What are the four classifications of techniques and methodologies for mental fatigue measurement mentioned in Faramarz Gharagozlou et al.'s 2015 research paper, "Detecting Driver Mental Fatigue Based on EEG Alpha Power Changes During Simulated Driving"?
----------
  A: subjective,  psychological,  performance and physiological  methods
  B: objective, perceptual, reaction-time and biological methods
  C: quantitative, qualitative, observational and experimental methods
  D: behavioral, cognitive, neurological and biochemical methods
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: ||Looking at the performance from Phase 1:
- My correct answers: 18/50 (36%)
- Teammate's correct answers: 20/50 (40%)

My teammate performed slightly better than me overall, with a 40% accuracy rate compared to my 36%. However, both scores are relatively low, suggesting these are very difficult, specialized questions.

For this specific question about classifications in a 2015 research paper on mental fatigue measurement, this requires very specific knowledge of that particular paper. Neither of us demonstrated strong performance on such specialized academic questions in Phase 1.

Given that:
1. My teammate had a slightly better overall performance (40% vs 36%)
2. This is a highly specialized question that neither of us is likely to know with certainty
3. The small performance difference suggests delegating might give a marginally better chance

I'll delegate this question to my teammate.

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: ||Looking at the Phase 1 results, my teammate got 20 questions correct out of 50 (40% accuracy), while I would need to check my own performance. Let me count my correct answers:

My teammate got only 36% correct, which is quite poor performance. Since I don't have specific knowledge about Mishary Alafasy and what reward he received on October 25, 2008, I would normally be guessing. However, given my teammate's poor track record (64% incorrect), I should answer this myself rather than delegate, as even a guess from me might be better than relying on my teammate.

- William Maurice Ewing received the Penrose Medal in 1974
- Marshall Kay received it in 1971
- Francis J. Pettijohn received it in 1981
- Arthur L. Day received it in 1972
