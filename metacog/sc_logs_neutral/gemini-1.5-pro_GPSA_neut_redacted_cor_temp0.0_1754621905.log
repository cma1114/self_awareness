Question:
Consider a finite well potential of potential defined in region-I from x=0 to x=a is 0 and outside everywhere for region-II, x<0 and region-III, x>a potential is defined to be V. Now, a particle trapped in this potential well has energy E<V. For such a scenario, what could be the probable current density J produced in the regions II and III. 
Probability current density J in the quantum mechanical system is defined by,
J= (ℏ/(2mi))( Ψ∇Ψ*- Ψ*∇Ψ )
Here Ψ is the wave function in the region of interest.
