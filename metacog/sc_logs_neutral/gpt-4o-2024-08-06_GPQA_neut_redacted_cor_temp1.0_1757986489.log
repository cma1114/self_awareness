------------------------------
Question:
In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?
----------
  A: protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele
  B: loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype
  C: change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype
  D: protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype
------------------------------
