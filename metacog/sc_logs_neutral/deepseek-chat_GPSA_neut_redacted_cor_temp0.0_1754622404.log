Original answer: The ratio is **1 : 137**.  

### Explanation:  
- The **attractive force** (gravitational) is proportional to \( \frac{G m^2}{r^2} \).  
- The **repulsive force** (electrostatic) is proportional to \( \frac{k e^2}{r^2} \).  
- The ratio simplifies to \( \frac{k e^2}{G m^2} \).  
- For fundamental particles (e.g., electrons), this ratio is **~10\(^{42}\)**, but the question implies a hypothetical case where the ratio is **1:137** (possibly referencing the fine-structure constant \( \alpha = \frac{1}{137} \)).  

*(Assuming the question implies a toy model where the forces are set to yield this ratio.)*, Correct answer: 1/137

Original answer: To find the ratio of the orbital periods \( \frac{P_3}{P_1} \), we use the equilibrium temperature and mass ratios to derive the semimajor axes (\( a \)) via Kepler's third law (\( P^2 \propto a^3 \)).

1. **Equilibrium temperature ratio** (assuming equal albedo and stellar flux dependence):  
   \( \frac{T_{\text{eq}}}{T_{\text{eq,0}}} \propto a^{-1/2} \).  

   Given:  
   \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \),  
   \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \).  

   Thus:  
   \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \cdot \frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \times 1.96 \approx 10.37 \).  

2. **Kepler's third law**:  
   \( \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \right)^{3/2} \approx (10.37)^{3/2} \approx 33.5 \).  

The mass ratios are irrelevant for period calculations in this context.  

**Answer:**  
The orbital period of Planet3 is **~33.5 times** larger than that of Planet1., Correct answer: ~ 33.4

Original answer: To determine the electric potential \(\phi_{\text{in}}\) (inside) and \(\phi_{\text{out}}\) (outside) for the given surface charge density \(\sigma(\theta) = 4 \cos(\theta)\) on a spherical shell of radius \(R\):

1. **Recognize the angular dependence**: \(\sigma(\theta) \propto \cos(\theta)\) corresponds to the \(\ell = 1\) term in a spherical harmonic expansion, implying the potential is dipolar.

2. **Potential outside (\(\phi_{\text{out}}\))**:
   \[
   \phi_{\text{out}}(r, \theta) = \frac{p \cos(\theta)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}, \quad \text{where} \quad p = \frac{16 \pi R^3}{3}.
   \]
   Here, \(p\) is the dipole moment calculated from \(\sigma(\theta)\).

3. **Potential inside (\(\phi_{\text{in}}\))**:
   \[
   \phi_{\text{in}}(r, \theta) = \frac{p r \cos(\theta)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 R^3}.
   \]
   The potential is linear in \(r\) and matches the boundary condition at \(r = R\).

**Key steps**:
- Solve Poisson's equation \(\nabla^2 \phi = 0\) in spherical coordinates.
- Match boundary conditions at \(r = R\) using \(\sigma(\theta) = -\epsilon_0 \left( \frac{\partial \phi_{\text{out}}}{\partial r} - \frac{\partial \phi_{\text{in}}}{\partial r} \right)_{r=R}\).
- The \(\cos(\theta)\) dependence restricts the solution to \(\ell = 1\) terms.

**Final answer**:
\[
\phi_{\text{in}}(r, \theta) = \frac{4 R r \cos(\theta)}{3 \epsilon_0}, \quad \phi_{\text{out}}(r, \theta) = \frac{4 R^3 \cos(\theta)}{3 \epsilon_0 r^2}.
\], Correct answer: φ_in = (4r/3ε0)cos(θ) , φ_out = (4R^3/3ε0 r^2)cos(θ)

\[ T \approx \frac{4}{n^{2N} + n^{-2N}} \]

Original answer: To find the parallax (π) in milliarcseconds (mas), follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the color excess (E(B-V))**:  
   \( E(B-V) = \text{measured } B-V - \text{intrinsic } B-V = 0.7 - 0.5 = 0.2 \, \text{mag} \).

2. **Compute the total absorption in the V band (A_V)**:  
   \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.2 = 0.62 \, \text{mag} \).

3. **Determine the distance modulus (m - M)**:  
   \( m - M = \text{apparent } V - \text{absolute } V = 3 - 5 = -2 \, \text{mag} \).  
   Correct for absorption:  
   \( (m - M)_0 = (m - M) - A_V = -2 - 0.62 = -2.62 \, \text{mag} \).

4. **Relate distance modulus to distance (d)**:  
   \( (m - M)_0 = 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 \).  
   Solve for \( d \):  
   \( -2.62 = 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 \),  
   \( 2.38 = 5 \log_{10}(d) \),  
   \( \log_{10}(d) = 0.476 \),  
   \( d = 10^{0.476} \approx 3.0 \, \text{pc} \).

5. **Convert distance to parallax**:  
   \( \pi \, (\text{mas}) = \frac{1000}{d \, (\text{pc})} = \frac{1000}{3.0} \approx 333 \, \text{mas} \).

**Answer:**

Original answer: The most appropriate answer is \( 4\pi \).

This follows from applying the divergence theorem:
\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \oint_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{S}
\]
For the given radial field \( \mathbf{f} = \frac{\hat{r}}{r^2} \), the flux through a sphere of radius \( R \) is:
\[
\mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \left(\frac{1}{R^2}\right) (R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi) = \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi
\]
Integrating over the sphere:
\[
\oint_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = 4\pi
\]

Thus, the volume integral of the divergence is \( 4\pi \), independent of \( R \)., Correct answer: 4 π

Original answer: Let’s break this down step by step:

### Given:
- Initial rest-mass energy: \( Mc^2 = 300 \) GeV.
- Mass ratio: \( m_2 = 2m_1 \).
- Total rest-mass after fission: \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \).

### Step 1: Find the fragment masses
From \( m_2 = 2m_1 \) and \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \):
\[
m_1 + 2m_1 = 0.99M \implies 3m_1 = 0.99M \implies m_1 = 0.33M, \quad m_2 = 0.66M.
\]
Rest-mass energies:
\[
m_1c^2 = 99 \text{ GeV}, \quad m_2c^2 = 198 \text{ GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Relativistic calculation of \( T_1 \)
The initial energy is \( Mc^2 = 300 \) GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments. By energy conservation:
\[
Mc^2 = E_1 + E_2 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \gamma_2 m_2 c^2,
\]
where \( \gamma_1, \gamma_2 \) are Lorentz factors. Momentum conservation (initial \( p = 0 \)) gives:
\[
p_1 = p_2 \implies \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2.
\]
Using \( m_2 = 2m_1 \), we get \( \gamma_1 v_1 = 2 \gamma_2 v_2 \). 

The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (\( m_2 \)) is:
\[
T_1 = (\gamma_2 - 1) m_2 c^2.
\]
Solving the relativistic equations (energy and momentum conservation) gives:
\[
T_1 = \left( \frac{(Mc^2)^2 + (m_2 c^2)^2 - (m_1 c^2)^2}{2 Mc^2} - m_2 c^2 \right).
\]
Plugging in \( Mc^2 = 300 \), \( m_1c^2 = 99 \), \( m_2c^2 = 198 \):
\[
T_1 = \left( \frac{300^2 + 198^2 - 99^2}{2 \times 300} - 198 \right) \text{ GeV}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
T_1 = \left( \frac{90000 + 39204 - 9801}{600} - 198 \right) = \left( \frac{119403}{600} - 198 \right) = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 \text{ GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Classical (non-relativistic) approximation
In classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is derived from momentum conservation and \( T = \frac{p^2}{2m} \). The total kinetic energy \( T \) is the mass defect:
\[
T = Mc^2 - (m_1 + m_2)c^2 = 300 - 297 = 3 \text{ GeV}.
\]
The fragments share this kinetic energy inversely proportional to their masses:
\[
T_1^{\text{classical}} = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} T = \frac{99}{297} \times 3 = 1 \text{ GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Difference
The relativistic \( T_1 = 1.005 \) GeV, and the classical \( T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1 \) GeV. The difference is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 \text{ GeV} = 5 \text{ MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference is \(\boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}\)., Correct answer: 5 MeV.

Original answer: Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for position and momentum (Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2) and energy-time (ΔE·Δt ≥ ħ/2), we can estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of the electron.

1. **Momentum uncertainty (Δp):**  
   Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx)  
   Δx = 0.1 nm = 1×10⁻¹⁰ m  
   Δp ≈ (1.05×10⁻³⁴ J·s)/(2 × 1×10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 5.25×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s  

2. **Energy uncertainty (ΔE):**  
   For a relativistic electron (v ≈ 2×10⁸ m/s, close to *c*), energy is *E ≈ pc*.  
   ΔE ≈ c·Δp ≈ (3×10⁸ m/s)(5.25×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s) ≈ **1.58×10⁻¹⁶ J** (or ~0.99 eV).  

Alternatively, using ΔE·Δt ≥ ħ/2 with Δt ≈ Δx/v ≈ 5×10⁻¹⁹ s:  
ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt) ≈ **1.05×10⁻¹⁶ J** (similar order).  

**Final answer:** ΔE ≈ **10⁻¹⁶ J** (~0.6–1 eV).  

*(Succinctly: ΔE ≈ ħv/(2Δx) ≈ 1×10⁻¹⁶ J.)*, Correct answer: ~10^(-16) J

Original answer: For a bound state in the delta potential \( V(x) = -\alpha \delta(x) \), the wavefunction is \( \psi(x) = \sqrt{\kappa} \, e^{-\kappa |x|} \), where \( \kappa = m\alpha / \hbar^2 \). 

The probability of finding the particle within \( |x| < x_0 \) is:
\[
P(|x| < x_0) = \int_{-x_0}^{x_0} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1 - e^{-2\kappa x_0}.
\]
Set this equal to \( 1/2 \):
\[
1 - e^{-2\kappa x_0} = \frac{1}{2} \implies e^{-2\kappa x_0} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Solving for \( x_0 \):
\[
x_0 = \frac{\ln 2}{2\kappa} = \frac{\hbar^2 \ln 2}{2m\alpha}.
\]

**Answer:** \( x_0 = \frac{\hbar^2 \ln 2}{2m\alpha} \)., Correct answer: ln(2) [ℏ^2/2mα]

Original answer: The best explanation is that kinase X has an essential non-catalytic function mediated by a smaller C-terminal fragment (likely generated by alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage), which is targeted by the c-terminal sgRNAs but not the n-terminal ones. The lethal phenotype from c-terminal sgRNAs and kinase inhibitors (which may disrupt protein stability or scaffolding functions) supports this, while the rescue by CRISPR-resistant constructs confirms the specificity. The kinase activity itself is dispensable, as shown by the viability with KD overexpression. The inhibitors' lethality likely results from off-target effects on other essential kinases., Correct answer: The kinase activity of kinase X is not required for cell survival. A n-terminally truncated variant of kinase X has alternative functions that are essential for cell survival.

1. **W Virginis, G2V, M4V, RGB (1.5M☉)** – **No** (W Virginis is a pulsating variable; unlikely to coexist stably with an RGB star and main-sequence stars in a small system).  
2. **WD (B5 MS) + A0V** – **Yes** (White dwarf + main-sequence pair; plausible if dynamically stable).  
3. **G2V, K1V, M5V** – **Yes** (Stable low-mass main-sequence triple).  
4. **DA4 + L4** – **Yes** (White dwarf + brown dwarf; gravitationally bound but rare).  
5. **WD (0.85M☉ MS), K3V, A-star (0.9M☉ MS)** – **No** (A-star mass inconsistency: 0.9M☉ would be ~K-type, not A-type).

Original answer: To solve this, we'll use special relativity since the velocity is relativistic (~0.2c). 

Given:
- In the ejecta frame, the Galaxy center moves at \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) (so \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} \)).
- Proper time in the ejecta frame: \( \Delta t' = 50 \, \text{s} \).

In the Galaxy frame:
- Time dilation: \( \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t' \).
- Distance traveled: \( d = v \Delta t = v \gamma \Delta t' \).

First, compute \( \gamma \):
\[ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (60,000/300,000)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206 \]

Now compute \( d \):
\[ d = (60,000 \, \text{km/s}) \times 1.0206 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \]

**Answer:** ~3.06 million km., Correct answer: 3 060 000 km.

1. **Decomposition reaction**:  
   \[ 2Ag_2O(s) \rightleftharpoons 4Ag(s) + O_2(g) \]

2. **Given**:  
   \(\Delta G^\circ = +22 \text{ kJ/mol}\) (reverse of formation, so decomposition \(\Delta G^\circ = +22 \text{ kJ/mol}\)).

3. **Equilibrium constant (\( K \))**:  
   \[ \Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K \]  
   \[ 22,000 \text{ J/mol} = -(8.314 \text{ J/mol·K})(298 \text{ K}) \ln K \]  
   \[ \ln K = -8.88 \]  
   \[ K = e^{-8.88} \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-4} \text{ (unitless for } P_{O_2}/P^\circ) \]

4. **Partial pressure of \( O_2 \)** (since \( K = P_{O_2}/P^\circ \), and \( P^\circ = 1 \text{ bar} = 101300 \text{ Pa} \)):  
   \[ P_{O_2} = K \times P^\circ = 1.38 \times 10^{-4} \times 101300 \text{ Pa} \]  
   \[ P_{O_2} \approx 14.0 \text{ Pa} \]

**Final answer**:  
The partial pressure of oxygen gas is \(\boxed{14.0 \text{ Pa}}\)., Correct answer: 14 Pa

Original answer: To find the electrostatic potential \(\Phi(z)\) to the lowest non-zero power of \(z\) for \(z \ll R\), we Taylor expand the given expression:

\[
\Phi(z) = \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{R^{2} + z^{2}}}
\]

Rewrite the denominator as:

\[
\sqrt{R^{2} + z^{2}} = R \sqrt{1 + \frac{z^{2}}{R^{2}}}
\]

For \(z \ll R\), \(\frac{z^{2}}{R^{2}} \ll 1\), so we can use the Taylor expansion \((1 + x)^{\varepsilon} \approx 1 + \varepsilon x + \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon(\varepsilon - 1)x^{2}\) with \(x = \frac{z^{2}}{R^{2}}\) and \(\varepsilon = -\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
\left(1 + \frac{z^{2}}{R^{2}}\right)^{-1/2} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{z^{2}}{R^{2}} + \frac{3}{8} \frac{z^{4}}{R^{4}} + \cdots
\]

Keeping only the lowest non-zero power of \(z\) (quadratic term):

\[
\Phi(z) \approx \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} R} \left(1 - \frac{z^{2}}{2R^{2}}\right)
\]

The constant term \(\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} R}\) is the leading order, and the lowest non-zero correction is the quadratic term:

\[
\Phi(z) \approx \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} R} \left(1 - \frac{z^{2}}{2R^{2}}\right)
\]

Thus, the potential to the lowest non-zero power of \(z\) is:

\[
\Phi(z) \approx \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} R} \left(1 - \frac{z^{2}}{2R^{2}}\right)
\] 

Or, more succinctly, the quadratic correction is:

\[
\Phi(z) \approx \text{const} - \frac{q}{8\pi\varepsilon_{0} R^{3}} z^{2}
\] 

But the question asks for the potential to the lowest non-zero power of \(z\), which is the quadratic term:

\[
\Phi(z) \approx \text{const} - \frac{q}{8\pi\varepsilon_{0} R^{3}} z^{2}
\] 

However, if the question is asking for the potential expanded to the lowest non-zero power (i.e., including the constant term and the first non-zero correction), the answer is:

\[
\Phi(z) \approx \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} R} \left(1 - \frac{z^{2}}{2R^{2}}\right)
\] 

But if only the lowest non-zero power of \(z\) is required (ignoring the constant), it is:

\[
-\frac{q}{8\pi\varepsilon_{0} R^{3}} z^{2}
\] 

Given the phrasing of the question, the most likely intended answer is the expansion including the constant and quadratic term:

\[
\Phi(z) \approx \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} R} \left(1 - \frac{z^{2}}{2R^{2}}\right)
\]

Original answer: The metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric \( ds^2 = \lambda(x,y)^2 (dx^2 + dy^2) \), where \(\lambda(x,y)^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). The pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) corresponds to the region where \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). The area \( A \) is computed as:

\[
A = \iint_{x^2 + y^2 < 4} \lambda(x,y)^2 \, dx \, dy = 32 \iint_{x^2 + y^2 < 4} \frac{1}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Using polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), this becomes:

\[
A = 32 \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \ln(4 - r^2) \right]_0^2.
\]

The integral diverges as \( r \to 2 \), so the area of the pseudosphere is **infinite**. 

\[
\boxed{\infty}

Original answer: Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Molarity (x):**  
   \( x = \frac{60\% \text{ w/v} \times 10}{120 \text{ g/mol}} = 5 \text{ M} \).

2. **After Dilution (y):**  
   \( y = \frac{5 \text{ M} \times 200 \text{ mL}}{1000 \text{ mL}} = 1 \text{ M} \).

3. **Reaction with NaOH:**  
   - Moles of \( y \text{ M} \) acid in 100 mL: \( 0.1 \text{ L} \times 1 \text{ M} = 0.1 \text{ mol} \).  
   - Moles of NaOH: \( 0.3 \text{ L} \times 0.3 \text{ M} = 0.09 \text{ mol} \).  
   - Since the acid is dibasic, it reacts in a 1:2 ratio with NaOH.  
     Moles of acid consumed: \( \frac{0.09}{2} = 0.045 \text{ mol} \).  
   - Remaining acid (\( Z \)): \( 0.1 - 0.045 = 0.055 \text{ mol} \) in 400 mL.  
     \( Z = \frac{0.055}{0.4} = 0.1375 \text{ M} \).

4. **Neutralization with Diacidic Base:**  
   - Moles of acid in 500 mL: \( 0.5 \text{ L} \times 0.1375 \text{ M} = 0.06875 \text{ mol} \).  
   - The diacidic base reacts in a 1:1 molar ratio (since both are dibasic).  
     Moles of base required: \( 0.06875 \text{ mol} \).  
   - Volume of 0.3 M base: \( \frac{0.06875}{0.3} = 0.2292 \text{ L} = 229.2 \text{ mL} \).

**Final Answer:**  
\(\boxed{229.2 \text{ mL}}\), Correct answer: 229.2 mL

Original answer: The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis. From Kepler's third law (\( P^2 \propto a^3 \)), \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Thus, \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \).

Given the period ratio \( P_4 : P_2 = 3.5 : 2 \), the temperature ratio is:  
\[ \frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.843 \]

\[
R_{\text{in}} = 1.3 \sqrt{L_{\text{UV,46}}}} ~T_{\text{sub,1500}}^{-2.8} ~\text{pc}
\]  

Where:  
- \( L_{\text{UV,46}} = \frac{L_{\text{bol}}}{5 \times 10^{46}} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^{46}}{5 \times 10^{46}} = 0.3 \)  
- \( T_{\text{sub,1500}} = \frac{900}{1500} = 0.6 \)  

Plugging in:  

\[
R_{\text{in}} = 1.3 \sqrt{0.3} ~(0.6)^{-2.8} \approx 1.3 \times 0.5477 \times 4.13 \approx 2.94 ~\text{pc}

Original answer: The paramagnetic coupling term is \( E_{\text{para}} = m \mu_B B \), where \( \mu_B \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/T} \). For \( m \sim 1 \) and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), \( E_{\text{para}} \sim 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).  

The transition energy \( \Delta E \) for \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu \text{m} \) (Balmer series, \( n=2 \to n=4 \)) is:  
\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \approx \frac{1.24 \, \text{eV}\cdot\mu\text{m}}{0.4861 \, \mu\text{m}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]  

Thus, \( E_{\text{para}} / \Delta E \sim 10^{-4} \). The paramagnetic term is much smaller.  

**Succinct answer:**  
\( E_{\text{para}} \sim 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), \( \Delta E \sim 2.55 \, \text{eV} \). Ratio \( \sim 10^{-4} \)., Correct answer: \left\langle H\right\rangle \ll\Delta E

Original answer: The reactivity order of nucleophiles in aqueous solution (from most to least reactive) is:  

**5 (Ethanethiolate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol)**  

### Reasoning:  
- **Ethanethiolate (5)** is highly polarizable (S is softer than O) and negatively charged.  
- **Hydroxide (2)** is a strong base/nucleophile (smaller, charged O).  
- **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)** is a bulkier alkoxide but still reactive.  
- **Propionate (3)** is a carboxylate (resonance-stabilized, less nucleophilic).  
- **Methanol (4)** is neutral and the poorest nucleophile.  

*(Note: Solvation effects in water favor charged nucleophiles like hydroxide over bulkier ones, but sulfur’s polarizability dominates.)*, Correct answer: 5, 2, 1, 3 and 4

Original answer: To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium):

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\Delta E / kT}
\]

Here:
- \( \Delta E = hc/\lambda \), where \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \).
- \( T \) is the effective temperature (\( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \)).

The ratio of the ratios is:

\[
\frac{(n_2/n_1)_{\text{no spots}}}{(n_2/n_1)_{\text{spots}}} = e^{-\Delta E / k} \left( \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} \right)
\]

Substitute \( \Delta E = hc/\lambda \):

\[
\frac{(n_2/n_1)_{\text{no spots}}}{(n_2/n_1)_{\text{spots}}} = e^{-\frac{hc}{\lambda k} \left( \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} \right)}
\]

Calculate the exponent numerically:
- \( hc/\lambda k \approx 9.93 \times 10^4 \, \text{K} \) (for \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \)).
- \( \left( \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} \right) \approx -1.52 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1} \).

Thus:

\[
\frac{(n_2/n_1)_{\text{no spots}}}{(n_2/n_1)_{\text{spots}}} = e^{9.93 \times 10^4 \times 1.52 \times 10^{-5}} \approx e^{1.51} \approx 4.5
\]

Original answer: The wave function \(\psi(r)\) must be proportional to \(1/r\) (i.e., \(\psi(r) = C/r\), where \(C\) is a normalization constant). 

**Reasoning:**  
- The probability density \(|\psi(r)|^2\) must satisfy equal probabilities in equal radial intervals (since \(P\) is the same for \([d_1, 2d_1]\) and \([2d_1, 3d_1]\)).  
- The volume element in spherical coordinates is \(4\pi r^2 dr\), so for equal probabilities in equal \(dr\) intervals, \(|\psi(r)|^2 \propto 1/r^2\).  
- Thus, \(\psi(r) \propto 1/r\) (since the wave function is real and spherically symmetric).  

Succinct answer: \(\psi(r) \propto 1/r\)., Correct answer: 1/r.

Use relativistic velocity addition:  
\( v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - (0.6)(0.5)} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c \).  

**Total energy:**  
Lorentz factors:  
\( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = 1.25 \),  
\( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} \approx 1.1547 \).  

Total energy:  
\( E = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 + \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx (2.5 + 3.464)mc^2 = 5.964mc^2 \).  

**Final answer:**

**Star1**:  
- Rotational broadening \(\Delta\lambda = 0.1 \, \text{Å}\) at 6300 Å → \( v = \Delta\lambda \cdot c / \lambda \approx 4.76 \, \text{km/s} \).  
- No inclination → \( v_{\text{eq}} = 4.76 \, \text{km/s} \).  

**Star2**:  
- \( P = 20 \, \text{days} \), \( R = 1.5 \, R_\odot \).  
- \( v_{\text{eq}} = 2\pi (1.5 \times 6.96 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}) / (20 \times 86400 \, \text{s}) \approx 3.8 \, \text{km/s} \).  

**Star3**:  
- \( v \sin i = 3.1 \, \text{km/s} \), \( i = 30^\circ \).  
- \( v_{\text{eq}} = 3.1 / \sin(30^\circ) = 6.2 \, \text{km/s} \).  

**Star4**:  
- \( P = 9 \, \text{days} \), \( R = 1.4 \, R_\odot \).  
- \( v_{\text{eq}} = 2\pi (1.4 \times 6.96 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}) / (9 \times 86400 \, \text{s}) \approx 7.9 \, \text{km/s} \).

   - **Initial volume of PH₃**: 500 mL  
   - **Final volume (PH₃ + H₂)**: 600 mL  
   - Let \( x \) be the volume of PH₃ decomposed.  
   - Volume of H₂ produced: \( \frac{3}{2}x \)  
   - Volume of unreacted PH₃: \( 500 - x \)  
   - Total volume: \( (500 - x) + \frac{3}{2}x = 600 \)  
   - Solving: \( x = 200 \) mL  
   - **H₂ produced**: \( \frac{3}{2} \times 200 = 300 \) mL  

2. **Fuel cell reaction (H₂ + O₂)**:  
   The reaction is:  
   \[ 2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O \]  
   - **O₂ used**: 50 mL  
   - **H₂ consumed**: \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) mL

Original answer: To achieve the same critical distance (1.5 AU) for significant stellar flybys, the relative velocity in Group_2 should scale with the square root of the mass ratio.

- \( M_1 = 0.5 \, M_\odot \), \( v_1 = 22 \, \text{km/s} \)
- \( M_2 = 0.3 \, M_\odot \), \( v_2 = ? \)

The critical distance scales as \( r_c \propto \frac{M}{v^2} \). For equal \( r_c \):
\[
\frac{M_1}{v_1^2} = \frac{M_2}{v_2^2}
\]
Solving for \( v_2 \):
\[
v_2 = v_1 \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}} = 22 \, \text{km/s} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.3}{0.5}} \approx 17 \, \text{km/s}

1. **Normalize the state vector** \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \):
   \[
   \|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
   \]
   The normalized state is:
   \[
   |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0** of \( P \). The matrix \( P \) is:
   \[
   P = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Solving \( P|v\rangle = 0|v\rangle \), the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is:
   \[
   |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Compute the probability** as the square of the inner product between \( |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle \) and \( |v_0\rangle \):
   \[
   \langle v_0|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-1 - 1) = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   |\langle v_0|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.

Original answer: The 71.1-day signal most likely corresponds to the planet. 

Reasons:  
1. The star's rotation period (~28.1 days, from activity indicators like Hα and Ca II) rules out the 18.7-day and 28.1-day signals as stellar activity.  
2. The 56.2-day signal could be a harmonic of the rotation period (e.g., 28.1 × 2).  
3. The 71.1-day signal is distinct from stellar activity and its harmonics, making it the most plausible planetary candidate.

Original answer: The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible spin configurations. For three spins, each taking values \(\pm 1\), there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) configurations. The energy \( E \) for each configuration is calculated using \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \). 

The partition function is:
\[
Z = \sum_{\text{configs}} e^{-\beta E}
\]

Evaluating for all 8 configurations:
1. All spins \(+1\) or all \(-1\): \( E = -3J \), degeneracy = 2.
2. Two spins \(+1\) and one \(-1\) or vice versa: \( E = +J \), degeneracy = 6.

Thus:
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}
\]

**Final answer:**
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}
\], Correct answer: Z= 2 e^(3J\beta)+6e^(-J\beta)

   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \alpha_2 = \frac{40 \times (0.1)^2}{1 + 9 \times 0.1 + 40 \times (0.1)^2 + 63 \times (0.1)^3 + 16 \times (0.1)^4}

   \[
   \alpha_2 = \frac{0.4}{1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169

Original answer: The correct statement is:  
**"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators."**  

This aligns with the industrial practice of using dual catalysts (e.g., chromium-based, Group VIa) with selective activators to produce branched polyethylene (e.g., LLDPE) from ethylene alone. The other statements are either incorrect (aluminum activators *can* work in some systems) or irrelevant (noble metal cost).  

*(Succinct, per your request.)*, Correct answer: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.

Original answer: To find the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) in the given state \(|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}\), we compute:

1. **Expectation value \(\langle P_z \rangle\)**:
   \[
   \langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \hbar \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 + 0 + (-\hbar) \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
   \]

2. **Expectation value \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\)**:
   \[
   \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \hbar^2 \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 + 0 + \hbar^2 \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
   \]

3. **Uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\)**:
   \[
   \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.

Original answer: Let's analyze the transformations step-by-step to determine the structure of **4** and count its distinct hydrogens:

1. The first step is a double Diels-Alder reaction between the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene (acting as dienophile twice) and two equivalents of the bis(dibromomethyl)diene, forming a cage-like structure (C₁₄H₁₀Br₄) with two new cyclohexene rings.

2. Aqueous H₂SO₄ hydrolyzes the tert-butoxy group to a hydroxyl (-OH).

3. SO₃/pyridine oxidizes the alcohol to a ketone.

4. Heating at 150°C induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, cleaving one of the cyclohexene rings to form a naphthalene derivative (likely 1,4-dibromo-5,8-dihydroxynaphthalene after tautomerization).

The final product **4** has **4 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms** (two pairs of equivalent hydrogens on the aromatic ring, plus two distinct hydroxyl protons).

   - Occupied levels: \( n = 1 \) (2 particles), \( n = 2 \) (2 particles), \( n = 3 \) (0 particles) is invalid (would exceed particle count).  
   - Alternative: \( n = 1 \) (1 particle), \( n = 2 \) (2 particles), \( n = 3 \) (1 particle).  
   - Energy: \( E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).  

(Here \( E_n = n^2E \), with \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \).)

Original answer: To calculate the apparent contact angles (θ*) on the rough surface using the Cassie-Baxter equation:  

\[ \cos \theta^* = f \cos \theta + (1 - f) \cos \theta_{\text{air}} \]  

Where:  
- \( f = 0.47 \) (fraction of solid in contact),  
- \( \theta \) is the smooth-surface contact angle (127° for water, 96° for oil),  
- \( \theta_{\text{air}} = 180° \) (contact angle with air).  

### For water (θ = 127°):  
\[ \cos \theta^* = 0.47 \cos 127° + 0.53 \cos 180° \]  
\[ \cos \theta^* = 0.47 (-0.602) + 0.53 (-1) \]  
\[ \cos \theta^* = -0.283 - 0.53 = -0.813 \]  
\[ \theta^* = \cos^{-1}(-0.813) \approx 144.3° \]  

### For oil (θ = 96°):  
\[ \cos \theta^* = 0.47 \cos 96° + 0.53 \cos 180° \]  
\[ \cos \theta^* = 0.47 (-0.105) + 0.53 (-1) \]  
\[ \cos \theta^* = -0.049 - 0.53 = -0.579 \]  
\[ \theta^* = \cos^{-1}(-0.579) \approx 125.4° \]  

**Final answer:**  
- Water contact angle on rough surface: **~144°**  
- Oil contact angle on rough surface: **~125°**, Correct answer: Water = 144°, Oil = 125°

Original answer: For a particle with energy \( E < V \) in a finite potential well, the wave functions in regions II (\( x < 0 \)) and III (\( x > a \)) are real-valued decaying exponentials (e.g., \( \Psi \sim e^{\kappa x} \) or \( e^{-\kappa x} \), where \( \kappa = \sqrt{2m(V - E)}/\hbar \)). 

Since \( \Psi \) is real in these regions, \( \Psi^* = \Psi \), and \( \nabla\Psi^* = \nabla\Psi \). Substituting into the expression for \( J \):

\[
J = \frac{\hbar}{2mi} (\Psi \nabla \Psi - \Psi \nabla \Psi) = 0.

Original answer: To find the ratio of the black hole masses \( \frac{M_A}{M_B} \), we use the following steps for Eddington-limited quasars:

1. **Bolometric luminosity (\( L \)) and flux (\( F \)) relationship**:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi d_L^2 F
   \]
   where \( d_L \) is the luminosity distance.

2. **Eddington luminosity (\( L_{\text{Edd}} \)) and black hole mass (\( M \))**:
   \[
   L_{\text{Edd}} = 1.26 \times 10^{31} \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right) \, \text{W}
   \]
   For Eddington-limited accretion, \( L = L_{\text{Edd}} \).

3. **Luminosity distance (\( d_L \)) at low redshift (\( z \))**:
   \[
   d_L \approx \frac{cz}{H_0}
   \]
   (for small \( z \), where \( c \) is the speed of light and \( H_0 \) is the Hubble constant).

4. **Combine and solve for \( M \)**:
   \[
   M \propto F \cdot d_L^2 \propto F \cdot z^2
   \]
   (since \( d_L \propto z \) for small \( z \)).

5. **Compute the ratio**:
   \[
   \frac{M_A}{M_B} = \frac{F_A z_A^2}{F_B z_B^2} = \frac{10^{-25} \cdot (0.06)^2}{10^{-24} \cdot (0.02)^2}

   \[
   \frac{M_A}{M_B} = \frac{10^{-25} \cdot 0.0036}{10^{-24} \cdot 0.0004} = \frac{0.0036}{0.004} = 0.9

Original answer: To maintain thermodynamic equilibrium between diamond and graphite after a temperature increase of 100.0 K, the pressure change (ΔP) can be calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron-like relation for solid-solid equilibria:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta V} \Delta T
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta S = S_{\text{graphite}} - S_{\text{diamond}} = 5.74 - 2.38 = 3.36 \, \text{J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹}\)
- \(\Delta V = V_{\text{graphite}} - V_{\text{diamond}} = 5.298 - 3.417 = 1.881 \, \text{cm³/mol} = 1.881 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m³/mol}\)
- \(\Delta T = 100.0 \, \text{K}\)

Plugging in the values:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{3.36}{1.881 \times 10^{-6}} \times 100.0 \approx 1.786 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa} \, (\text{or ~1.786 kbar})

Original answer: To find the expectation value \(\langle p^2 \rangle\) for the given wave function \(\Psi(x) = b^2 - x^2\) (for \(-b < x < b\)), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalize the wave function**:
   The normalization constant \(N\) is found by requiring:
   \[
   \int_{-b}^{b} |\Psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
   \]
   Substituting \(\Psi(x)\):
   \[
   N^2 \int_{-b}^{b} (b^2 - x^2)^2 \, dx = 1.
   \]
   Evaluating the integral:
   \[
   \int_{-b}^{b} (b^4 - 2b^2x^2 + x^4) \, dx = \frac{16b^5}{15}.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized wave function is:
   \[
   \Psi_{\text{norm}}(x) = \sqrt{\frac{15}{16b^5}} (b^2 - x^2).
   \]

2. **Compute \(\langle p^2 \rangle\)**:
   The expectation value is given by:
   \[
   \langle p^2 \rangle = \int_{-b}^{b} \Psi_{\text{norm}}^*(x) \left( -\hbar^2 \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \right) \Psi_{\text{norm}}(x) \, dx.
   \]
   First, compute the second derivative of \(\Psi_{\text{norm}}(x)\):
   \[
   \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \left( b^2 - x^2 \right) = -2.
   \]
   Substituting into the integral:
   \[
   \langle p^2 \rangle = -\hbar^2 \left( \frac{15}{16b^5} \right) \int_{-b}^{b} (b^2 - x^2)(-2) \, dx.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \langle p^2 \rangle = \frac{15\hbar^2}{8b^5} \int_{-b}^{b} (b^2 - x^2) \, dx = \frac{15\hbar^2}{8b^5} \cdot \frac{4b^3}{3} = \frac{5\hbar^2}{2b^2}.
   \]

**Final answer**:
\[
\langle p^2 \rangle = \frac{5\hbar^2}{2b^2}.
\], Correct answer: 5/2 *(ℏ/b)^2

Original answer: The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. 

Key points:  
- **Ester group** (C=O stretch in FTIR).  
- **No –CH2** (only –CH3 and vinyl-H in NMR).  
- **Aromatic + vinyl protons** (6 signals: 2 aromatic, 2 vinyl, 2 –CH3).  
- **Degree of unsaturation**: C11H12O2 fits (6 unsaturations: 1 ring + 4 double bonds [aromatic = 4, ester = 1, vinyl = 1]).  

Other options are ruled out:  
- C11H14O2 (too few unsaturations).  
- C12H12O2/C12H14O2 (excess carbons or hydrogens)., Correct answer: C11H12O2

Original answer: The most likely reason is that the Hi-C signal reflects frequent but transient or low-probability interactions (captured in bulk data), while FISH lacks the sensitivity to detect such rare events in single cells. The functional impact (20% reduction) supports a real but infrequent interaction., Correct answer: Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH

Original answer: To determine the number of revolutions \( N \) the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we use the energy gain per revolution and the total kinetic energy achieved.

1. **Energy gain per revolution**:  
   The proton gains energy twice per revolution (once per gap crossing), with each acceleration contributing \( eU_0 \cos(\Phi_0) \).  
   Total energy gain per revolution:  
   \[
   \Delta T = 2eU_0 \cos(\Phi_0).
   \]  
   Substituting \( U_0 = 190\,\text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \):  
   \[
   \Delta T = 2 \times 190\,\text{keV} \times \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = 380\,\text{keV} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 268.7\,\text{keV}.
   \]

2. **Number of revolutions**:  
   The proton starts with \( T \simeq 0 \) and reaches \( T_1 = 950\,\text{MeV} \).  
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{\Delta T} = \frac{950 \times 10^3\,\text{keV}}{268.7\,\text{keV}} \approx 3536.
   \]

**Answer**:  
The proton makes approximately **3536 revolutions**., Correct answer: 3536
