Original answer: Planet_1/Star_1 should be observed first. The transit signal strength is proportional to (Rp/Rs)², where Rp is planet radius and Rs is star radius. For Planet_1/Star_1, this ratio is (4R)/(2R) = 2, while for Planet_2/Star_2, it's (R)/(R) = 1. Therefore, Planet_1/Star_1 will produce a stronger transit signal (4x stronger) despite the larger star., Correct answer: Planet_1 because its semi-amplitude signal in RV is 12 times larger.

Original answer: The most likely correct answer is 3: One of the kinematic processes used is prohibited.

This is because pion decay must conserve various quantum numbers and follow conservation laws. If one of the proposed decay processes violates these fundamental rules (like lepton number conservation, charge conservation, or energy-momentum conservation), it would be kinematically forbidden, explaining the discrepancy between analytical and numerical results.

The other options are less likely because:
1. A being constant is a valid assumption for weak interactions
2. Typos are unlikely to systematically affect results
4. Mass data for pions and leptons is well-established, Correct answer: 1, 2.

Original answer: Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, find critical angle i₀:
   i₀ = arcsin(n₂/n₁) = arcsin(1.26/1.75) = 46.3°

2) For lateral displacement (Goos-Hänchen shift), formula is:
   D = (2λ/π) × (sin i)/[n₁cos i × √(sin²i - sin²i₀)]

3) Plugging in values:
   λ = 400nm
   i = 80°
   sin i = 0.985
   cos i = 0.174

4) Calculating:
   D = (2×400/π) × 0.985/[1.75×0.174 × √(0.970 - 0.525)]
   D = 1,012 nm ≈ 1.01 μm

Original answer: Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, let's find each star's luminosity using L ∝ R²T⁴
Star A: R = 1, T = 6000K
Star B: R = 0.5, T = 4000K

2) When both stars are visible, total brightness = LA + LB
When one star eclipses the other, brightness = max(LA, LB)
When planet transits, negligible effect due to small size

3) Maximum brightness occurs when both stars visible
Minimum brightness when brighter star is eclipsed by dimmer star

4) Therefore, ratio = (LA + LB)/max(LA, LB)

5) LA = 1² × 6000⁴ = 1296
   LB = 0.5² × 4000⁴ = 32

Original answer: Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, normalize |alpha>:
N = sqrt((1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)) = sqrt(2 + 5) = sqrt(7)
|alpha> = [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]/sqrt(7)

2) The matrix A is:
[0   ℏ/2]
[ℏ/2  0 ]

3) Eigenvectors and eigenvalues:
λ = ±ℏ/2
|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

4) Probabilities:
P(+) = |<+|alpha>|² = 1/2
P(-) = |<-|alpha>|² = 1/2

5) Average value:
<A> = (ℏ/2)(1/2) + (-ℏ/2)(1/2) = 0

Therefore:
P(+) = P(-) = 1/2
<A> = 0, Correct answer: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7

2) For Star_2:
   [Mg/H]_2 = 0
   [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
   Therefore, [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3

3) Convert to number ratio:
   nSi_1/nSi_2 = 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6 = 4

Original answer: Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, count all bonds:
- C-C: 6 bonds
- C=C: 2 bonds
- C-H: 18 bonds

2) Calculate total bond energy:
- C-C: 6 × 200 = 1200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 2 × 300 = 600 kJ/mol
- C-H: 18 × 400 = 7200 kJ/mol

3) Sum of bond energies = 9000 kJ/mol

4) For atomization:
- 10 carbons × 1000 = 10000 kJ/mol
- 18 hydrogens × (100/2) = 900 kJ/mol

5) ΔHf = Bond energies - Atomization energies

1) The distance modulus equation is: m - M = 5log(d/10) + Av
   where Av = 3.1 × E(B-V)

2) For each star, let's solve for distance:
   a) 8 - 8 = 0 → d = 10 pc
   b) 7 - 8 = -1 → d ≈ 6.3 pc
   c) 9 - 8 = 1 → d ≈ 15.8 pc
   d) 7 - 8 = -1 + (3.1 × 0.2) → d ≈ 8.9 pc
   e) 7 - 7 = 0 + (3.1 × 0.2) → d ≈ 12.6 pc
   f) 7 - 7 = 0 → d = 10 pc

Therefore, the correct order from nearest to farthest is:

Original answer: Based on the data, G2 appears to be a key transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3. This is evident because:
1. g2 mutant alone shows complete loss of resistance (0%)
2. Any double mutant with g2 also shows complete loss of resistance (0%)
3. G1 and G3 likely work in partially redundant pathways downstream of G2, as their individual mutations show partial loss of resistance (75% and 50%), but their combined mutation (g1g3) shows severe loss (10%)., Correct answer: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3

Original answer: Let me solve this step by step:

1) For diffraction, bright spots occur when path difference = nλ
2) For first bright spot (n=1): sin(15°) = λ1/d
3) For second bright spot (n=2): sin(20°) = λ2/d
4) De Broglie wavelength: λ = h/p = h/(mv)
5) Average velocity in Maxwell distribution: v = √(8kT/πm)
6) Substituting and simplifying:
   λ1/λ2 = √(m2T2/m1T1)
7) sin(15°)/sin(20°) = √(2T2/T1)
8) Therefore, T1/T2 = 2[sin(15°)/sin(20°)]²

T1/T2 = 1.0

The answer is 1.0, Correct answer: 1.3

Original answer: Let me solve this step by step:

1) For solution3: 5 cm³ of 0.02M NaOH in 65 cm³ total
pH3 = 11.19

2) For solution2: Need to find initial pH1 first
- Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.002 mol
- Initial moles NaOH = 0.0008 mol
- After reaction, 0.0012 mol CH₃COOH remains with 0.0008 mol CH₃COONa
pH1 = 4.76

3) Adding 5 cm³ more NaOH to solution1:
- Additional 0.0001 mol NaOH
- Final concentrations adjusted for new volume
pH2 = 4.93

4) pH3 - pH2 = 11.19 - 4.93 = 6.26

The answer is 6.26, Correct answer: 6.55
