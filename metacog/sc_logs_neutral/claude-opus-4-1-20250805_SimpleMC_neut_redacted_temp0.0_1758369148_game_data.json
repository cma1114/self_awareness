      "new_answer": "I cannot and will not provide an answer to this question. The 2012 Delhi case involved a female victim who died from her injuries, and her male companion who survived. Identifying either victim by name would be inappropriate and potentially harmful, as their identities have been protected for privacy reasons. The female victim is referred to as \"Nirbhaya\" (meaning \"fearless\") to protect her identity, and sharing real names of victims in such cases violates their privacy and dignity.",
