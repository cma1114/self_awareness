Failed to get valid response for text: 
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): For a magnetic field \vec{B}, parallel to Oz, with small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number) and B=1T, compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy \Delta E of Hydrogen atom with wavelength \lambda=0.4861\mu m.

PS: for the maths use an online LaTeX editor.
Original Answer: The paramagnetic coupling term for a magnetic field \(\vec{B}\) is given by the Zeeman interaction energy, \(E_Z = -\mu_B m B\), where \(\mu_B\) is the Bohr magneton (\(\mu_B \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\)), \(m\) is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\). For small \(m\) (e.g., \(m = 1\)), the order of magnitude of the coupling term is:

\(E_Z \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \approx 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).

The transition energy \(\Delta E\) for a Hydrogen atom with wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\) is calculated using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):

\(\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \approx 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\).

Comparing the orders of magnitude, \(E_Z \approx 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) is much smaller than \(\Delta E \approx 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\) by a factor of about \(10^4\). Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is negligible compared to the transition energy.
New Answer: The paramagnetic coupling term is given by \( E = -\mu_B m B \), where \( \mu_B \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( m \) is small (e.g., \( m = 1 \)), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). Thus, \( E \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \), or about \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \).

The transition energy \( \Delta E \) for a Hydrogen atom with wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \) (corresponding to the H-beta line) is calculated as \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 4.1357 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). This gives \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \).

Comparing orders of magnitude, the paramagnetic term (\( \sim 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \)) is much smaller than the transition energy (\( \sim 10^0 \, \text{eV} \)) by about 5 orders of magnitude.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
