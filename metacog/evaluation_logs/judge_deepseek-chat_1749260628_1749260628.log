I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: The reaction of silver and oxygen to silver oxide Ag2O has a standard Gibbs free energy (deltaG) of -22 kJ/mol (25 centigrade, 101300 Pa). When placing 23.2 g of solid Ag2O in 1 L of nitrogen gas and closing the vessel, the compound partly decomposes back to the elements. What is the partial pressure of oxygen gas in the vessel under the mentioned standard conditions? (Consider the gases as ideal gases.)
Gold-standard answer: 14 Pa
Subject response: To solve this, we need to use the relationship between Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant \( K \):

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K
\]

Given \(\Delta G^\circ = -22 \, \text{kJ/mol} = -22000 \, \text{J/mol}\), \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol K}\), and \(T = 298 \, \text{K}\):

\[
-22000 = -8.314 \times 298 \ln K
\]

\[
\ln K = \frac{22000}{8.314 \times 298}
\]

\[
\ln K \approx 8.87
\]

\[
K \approx e^{8.87}
\]

\[
K \approx 7100
\]

For the decomposition reaction:

\[
2 \text{Ag}_2\text{O} (s) \rightleftharpoons 4 \text{Ag} (s) + \text{O}_2 (g)
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K \) is related to the partial pressure of \( \text{O}_2 \) by:

\[
K = P_{\text{O}_2}
\]

Thus, the partial pressure of oxygen gas in the vessel is approximately 7100 Pa.

Question: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}
Gold-standard answer: -12*hbar/25
Subject response: To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi
\]

where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

Calculate:

\[
\sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ 3i^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Then:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)
\]

\[
= 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \(-24\).
