You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): A particle of mass m moves in a 1D potential given by V(x) = -α δ(x), where δ(x) is the usual Dirac delta function, and α is some positive constant. The particle is bound. Find the value of x0 such that the probability of finding the particle with |x|< x0 is exactly equal to 1/2.


Original Answer: x0 = (ln 2) * (hbar^2 / (mα))
New Answer: x0 = (ln 4) * (hbar^2 / (m * alpha))

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.

Question Text (for context): Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory? Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.

Star1 - RA = 15 deg and DEC = -75 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.

Star2 - RA = 30 deg and DEC = 55 deg, apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.

Star3 - RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.

Star4 - RA = 85 deg and DEC = -48 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.

Star5 - RA = 10 h and DEC = 60 deg, absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.
Original Answer: Star3 and Star5.
New Answer: Star3.

Question Text (for context): Scientist 1 is studying linkage maps in Drosophila. Specifically, Scientist 1 is working out the linkage between 3 genes in one cross, also known as a three-point testcross. The genes under study are V, CV, and CT. To obtain the required information a trihybrid female and a tester male (triple recessive male) are crossed. Analyzing the information from this cross, the genetic mapping and the genetic map units (m.u.) read as follows:

V - - CT - CV
V -> CV: 18.5%
V -> CT: 13.2%
CV -> CT: 6.4 %

Scientist 1 questioned the data, asking, "Why was the addition of V -> CT and CV -> CT (13.2% + 6.4%) greater than the m.u. for V -> CV (18.5%)?
Original Answer: Double crossovers occurred between V and CV.
New Answer: Double crossovers occurred between V and CV, which were not accounted for in the direct V -> CV calculation.
