Failed to get valid response for text: 
I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>
Gold-standard answer: U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
Subject response: The input state is $|\psi\rangle = (\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle - \gamma|1\rangle) \otimes |0\rangle$. Since the control qubit (first qubit) is in the state $|0\rangle$, the C-NOT gate will apply the NOT operation to the target qubit (second qubit) if and only if the control qubit is $|1\rangle$. Therefore, the output state will be:

$|\psi_\text{out}\rangle = (\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle - \gamma|1\rangle) \otimes |1\rangle$

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
C: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
