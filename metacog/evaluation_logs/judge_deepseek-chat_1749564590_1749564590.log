I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Which of the following statements is a correct physical interpretation of the commutator of two gamma matrices, i/2 [gamma^mu, gamma^nu]?

1. It gives a contribution to the angular momentum of the Dirac field.
2. It gives a contribution to the four-momentum of the Dirac field.
3. It generates all Poincaré transformations of the Dirac field.
4. It generates all Lorentz transformations of the Dirac field.
Gold-standard answer: 1 and 4
Subject response: Given the technical nature of this quantum field theory question involving gamma matrices and their commutators, and considering my teammate's moderate performance rate of 50%, I will attempt to answer this myself as I have good knowledge of this topic.

1 is the correct answer. The commutator of gamma matrices i/2[γμ,γν] represents the generator of Lorentz transformations in the spinor representation and gives a contribution to the angular momentum of the Dirac field. This is related to the spin angular momentum of the Dirac field specifically.

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
