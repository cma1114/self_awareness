You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): You want to cultivate a population of mouse embryonic stem cells that closely resemble the pre-implantation cells of the ICM of the blastocyst. Which of these components would form part of a cell culture medium suited to keep your cells in this state?
Original Answer: Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and 2i (a combination of MEK inhibitor and GSK3 inhibitor) would be key components of a cell culture medium to maintain mouse embryonic stem cells in a pre-implantation, inner cell mass-like state.
New Answer: Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) would be a key component of the cell culture medium to maintain mouse embryonic stem cells in a state resembling the pre-implantation cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.

Choose the single best option (A or B).

Question Text (for context): Grover iterator is a quantum gate that amplifies the amplitude of the target state while reducing the amplitude of the non-target states. What are the eigenvalues of the Grover iterator G in terms of Œ∏?
Original Answer: The eigenvalues of the Grover iterator G in terms of Œ∏ are:
e^(¬±i2Œ∏)
New Answer: The eigenvalues of the Grover iterator G in terms of the angle Œ∏ are:
e^(i(œÄ - 2Œ∏)) and e^(i(œÄ + 2Œ∏))

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.

Question Text (for context): Consider a uniformly charged metallic ring of radius R and total charge q. The ring is a hollow toroid of thickness 2a\ll R. The ùë• ùë¶ plane coincides with the plane of the ring, while the ùëß-axis is perpendicular to it. The electrostatic potential \Phi(z) along the axis of the ring at a ùëß distance from its center is \Phi(z)=\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}} . Calculate the electrostatic potential Œ¶(ùëß) to the lowest non-zero power of ùëß, assuming z\ll R. Taylor expansion formula is,
(1+x)^{\varepsilon}\approx1+\varepsilon x+\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon(\varepsilon-1)x^{2},when|x|\ll1.
Original Answer: Œ¶(z) ‚âà q/(4œÄŒµ‚ÇÄR) - q/(8œÄŒµ‚ÇÄR¬≥)z¬≤
New Answer: Œ¶(z) = (q / (4œÄŒµ‚ÇÄ)) * (1 / ‚àö(R¬≤ + z¬≤))
Assuming z << R, we can use the Taylor expansion:
(1 + x)^Œµ ‚âà 1 + Œµx + (1/2)Œµ(Œµ-1)x¬≤
Substituting x = z¬≤/R¬≤, we get:
Œ¶(z) ‚âà (q / (4œÄŒµ‚ÇÄ)) * (1 / R) * (1 - (z¬≤/2R¬≤))

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
