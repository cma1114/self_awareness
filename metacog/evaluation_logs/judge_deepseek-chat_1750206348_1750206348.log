Failed to get valid response for text: 
I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: In what year did Nikolai Andreev win the Leelavati Award?
Gold-standard answer: 2022
Subject response: Since I'm not completely confident about when Nikolai Andreev won the Leelavati Award, and given that both my teammate and I performed equally well in Phase 1 (50% correct each), I'll attempt to answer this myself since I have no reason to believe my teammate would perform better on this specific question.

2014

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
