You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context):  Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.
Original Answer: For a relativistic harmonic oscillator, energy conservation gives:

$$E = \gamma mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

At maximum amplitude: $E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2$

At maximum speed (x=0): $E = \gamma_{max}mc^2$

Therefore: $\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2$

Solving: $\gamma_{max} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$

Since $\gamma_{max} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$:

$$v_{max} = c\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_{max}^2}} = c\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$$

For small oscillations where $kA^2 \ll mc^2$, this reduces to $v_{max} \approx \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}A$.
New Answer: Looking at this relativistic harmonic oscillator, I need to use energy conservation.

At maximum amplitude A, all energy is potential: $E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2$

At maximum speed (x=0), all energy is kinetic: $E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$ where $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$

Setting these equal and solving for v:
$\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2$

After algebraic manipulation:
$$v_{max} = c\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$$

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.

Question Text (for context): A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:
Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.
Which combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?
Original Answer: **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions; reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.

In basic solutions, OH⁻ ions stabilize reduced oxygen species, making O₂ a weaker oxidant thermodynamically. Kinetically, O₂ reduction is slower in acidic solutions due to the multi-electron transfer mechanism being less favorable.
New Answer: weaker oxidant in basic solutions, faster in acidic solutions

Question Text (for context): Quasar A with a bolometric flux of 10^-25 W/m^2 is observed at a redshift of z=0.06 . Quasar B with bolometric flux of 10^-24 W/m^2 is observed at redshift of z=0.02. Assume that the accretion of their central black hole is Eddington limited. Find the ratio of the mass of their central black hole, MA/MB?


Original Answer: I need to find the ratio of black hole masses using the Eddington limit and observed fluxes.

For Eddington-limited accretion: L = L_Edd ∝ M

The luminosity relates to observed flux by: L = 4πd²F

Using luminosity distance: d ∝ z (for small z)

So: L_A/L_B = (d_A²F_A)/(d_B²F_B) = (z_A²F_A)/(z_B²F_B)

L_A/L_B = (0.06² × 10⁻²⁵)/(0.02² × 10⁻²⁴) = (0.0036 × 10⁻²⁵)/(0.0004 × 10⁻²⁴) = 0.9

Since L ∝ M for Eddington limit:

M_A/M_B = 0.9
New Answer: I need to find the ratio of black hole masses using the Eddington limit and observed fluxes.

For Eddington-limited accretion: L = L_Edd ∝ M

The luminosity distance relationship: L = 4πd_L²F

For small redshifts: d_L ≈ cz/H₀

So: L ∝ z²F

For quasar A: L_A ∝ (0.06)² × 10⁻²⁵ = 3.6 × 10⁻²⁸
For quasar B: L_B ∝ (0.02)² × 10⁻²⁴ = 4 × 10⁻²⁷

Since L ∝ M for Eddington-limited sources:

M_A/M_B = L_A/L_B = (3.6 × 10⁻²⁸)/(4 × 10⁻²⁷) = 0.09

M_A/M_B = 0.09

A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.

Question Text (for context): Scientist 1 is studying linkage maps in Drosophila. Specifically, Scientist 1 is working out the linkage between 3 genes in one cross, also known as a three-point testcross. The genes under study are V, CV, and CT. To obtain the required information a trihybrid female and a tester male (triple recessive male) are crossed. Analyzing the information from this cross, the genetic mapping and the genetic map units (m.u.) read as follows:

V - - CT - CV
V -> CV: 18.5%
V -> CT: 13.2%
CV -> CT: 6.4 %

Scientist 1 questioned the data, asking, "Why was the addition of V -> CT and CV -> CT (13.2% + 6.4%) greater than the m.u. for V -> CV (18.5%)?
Original Answer: Double crossovers were not counted in the V -> CV distance calculation, but they were included when adding the individual segments (V -> CT + CV -> CT), making the sum appear larger than the direct V -> CV measurement.
New Answer: Double crossovers were counted twice in the addition but only once in the direct V -> CV measurement.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
