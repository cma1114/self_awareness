I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: "Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:
At the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.
At the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.
At the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.
At the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.
At the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3
Which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?


Gold-standard answer: Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples
Subject response: The Ct values are inverted - they should decrease with increasing copy number, not increase. In a proper qPCR, higher starting copy numbers result in lower Ct values.

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: The Interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by

\mathcal{L}\left(y\right)=-\lambda{f}\bar{\psi}{f}\left(y\right)\left(\upsilon+X\left(y\right)\right)\psi_{f}\left(y\right)

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV.
What are the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order?

PS: for the maths use a LaTeX editor.
Gold-standard answer: X\rightarrow c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}
Subject response: X → fermion + antifermion, but only for fermions with mass < 3 GeV (half the X boson mass) due to energy conservation.

Question: ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?
Gold-standard answer: At active promoters and enhancers
Subject response: Peaks at weak/transient binding sites, as DSG provides stronger crosslinking than PFA alone.

Question: The state $\psi$ of a system is given in terms of a complete and orthonormal set of basis vectors $|\phi_1>,  |\phi_2>,  |\phi_3>$ and $| \phi_4 >$ as $|\psi> = \sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>$. The basis vectors $|\phi_n>$ are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator $H$ satisfying $H |\phi_n> = n E_o |\phi_n>; n=1, 2, 3, 4. Calculate the average energy of the system in some repeated measurements. 

Gold-standard answer: 81/23 E_o
Subject response: The average energy is (1/15)E₀ + (2/15)(2E₀) + (4/15)(3E₀) + (16/15)(4E₀) = 3E₀
