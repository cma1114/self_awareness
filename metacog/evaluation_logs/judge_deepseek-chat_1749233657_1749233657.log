I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: "Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:
At the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.
At the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.
At the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.
At the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.
At the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3
Which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?


Gold-standard answer: Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples
Subject response: The results show an inverse relationship between Ct values and copy numbers - higher copy numbers are showing higher Ct values, which is incorrect. In qPCR, higher copy numbers should give lower Ct values. The data appears to be recorded or entered in reverse order.

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.
Gold-standard answer: (1+n*v)/(n+v)
Subject response: (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(nc))

This follows from relativistic velocity addition formula.

Question: The state $\psi$ of a system is given in terms of a complete and orthonormal set of basis vectors $|\phi_1>,  |\phi_2>,  |\phi_3>$ and $| \phi_4 >$ as $|\psi> = \sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>$. The basis vectors $|\phi_n>$ are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator $H$ satisfying $H |\phi_n> = n E_o |\phi_n>; n=1, 2, 3, 4. Calculate the average energy of the system in some repeated measurements. 

Gold-standard answer: 81/23 E_o
Subject response: Let me calculate:
<E> = Σ |cn|²En = (1/15)E₀ + (2/15)(2E₀) + (4/15)(3E₀) + (16/15)(4E₀) = 3.4E₀
