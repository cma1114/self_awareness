You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): Consider a one-dimensional spin chain, in which any pair of spins are separated by m lattice constants. The correlation function between these two spins varies exponentially with the m. The corresponding length scale depends upon elements of the transfer matrix between two nearest neighbors of the spin chain. If the nearest neighborhood coupling is J, then the ratio of the largest and the second largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix at the equilibrium temperature T is given by (consider the Boltzmann constant k = 1)
Original Answer: The ratio of the largest to the second largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix for a one-dimensional spin chain with nearest-neighbor coupling J at temperature T is given by cosh(2J/T).
New Answer: e^(2J/T) + e^(-2J/T)

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.

Question Text (for context): An organic chemist performs two reactions.
Reaction I:
(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.
Reaction II:
Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.
The progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.
How many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?
Original Answer: Normal-phase HPLC: 2 peaks  
Chiral HPLC: 4 peaks
New Answer: Normal-phase HPLC: 2 peaks (one for the product of Reaction I and one for the product of Reaction II, as they are chemically distinct).

Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (one for the chiral product of Reaction I, which is a single enantiomer, and two for the racemic mixture of enantiomers from Reaction II).

Question Text (for context): Two electromagnetic (em) fields are applied on the 1s->2p transition of a Hydrogen atomic vapor sample. The field#1 is polarized in z-direction, propagating in x-direction, with an amplitude E1, wave vector amplitude k, and frequency w1. The field#2 is circularly polarized, propagating in z-direction, with an amplitude E2, wave vector amplitude k, and frequency w2. Let us now apply a dc electric field with an amplitude E0 along z-direction to this vapor sample. The absorption probability of both the em fields will be maximum and equal, if the frequency w2 is given by (where a0 is the Bohr radius and e is the electronic charge)
Original Answer: w2 = w1 + (e E0)/(hbar k a0)
New Answer: w2 = w1 + (3/2) * (e * E0 * a0) / hbar

This accounts for the Stark effect induced by the DC electric field E0, which shifts the energy levels of the 2p states in Hydrogen. The field#1 (linearly polarized along z) couples to the 2p_z state, while field#2 (circularly polarized) couples to the 2p_x and 2p_y states. The Stark shift for the 2p_z state is different from that of 2p_x and 2p_y, and the frequency w2 must be adjusted to match the shifted transition energy for equal absorption probability.
