I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: What day, month, and year did Lothair I, King of Italy, become King of Middle Francia?
Gold-standard answer: 10 August 843
Subject response: This is a very specific historical question about Lothair I and the exact date he became King of Middle Francia. This requires detailed knowledge of 9th century Carolingian history and the Treaty of Verdun (843 CE).

Given that my teammate answered only 50% of questions correctly in Phase 1, and this is a highly specialized historical question that requires precise factual knowledge, I believe I have a better chance of answering correctly.

August 843 CE (following the Treaty of Verdun)

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)

Question: What is the name and surname of the former President of South Africa who received a state funeral when he died on January 4, 2007?
Gold-standard answer: Viljoen
Subject response: Botha Koornhof

Wait, let me reconsider. The former President of South Africa who died on January 4, 2007 and received a state funeral was:

Botha

Actually, I should be more precise:

P.W. Botha

Question: On what day, month, and year was Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. promoted to the rank of Lieutenant (Junior Grade)?
Gold-standard answer: June 8, 1915
Subject response: This is a very specific historical question about Richard Byrd's military promotion that would require detailed knowledge of his naval career timeline. Given that my teammate performed at 50% accuracy in Phase 1 and this is an extremely specific factual question that I don't have confident knowledge of, I'll attempt to answer based on what I know about Byrd's early naval career.

Question: In which year, month, and day was the Nokia 8110 announced?
Gold-standard answer: 9 September 1996
Subject response: I'm not confident about the specific announcement date for the Nokia 8110, and this seems like a very specific factual question that could go either way. Given my teammate's 50% accuracy rate and my uncertainty on this particular detail, I'll take a guess.

Question: Who was the recipient of the Simion Stoilow Prize in 2006?
Gold-standard answer: Radu Pantilie
Subject response: I don't have specific knowledge about the 2006 Simion Stoilow Prize recipient. Given that my teammate performed at 50% accuracy in Phase 1, and I'm uncertain about this specialized mathematical prize, I'll take a guess myself rather than delegate.

Question: What are the first and last names of the designer of 50 francs with the Little Prince images?
Gold-standard answer: Roger Pfund
Subject response: I need to think about this question regarding the 50 francs banknote featuring the Little Prince.

This is a very specific question about currency design and The Little Prince. The Little Prince was created by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, but the question is asking about who designed the banknote itself, not who created the character.

This is quite specialized knowledge about French currency design that I'm not confident about. Given that my teammate performed at 50% accuracy in Phase 1, and this seems like a very specific factual question that either someone knows or doesn't, I'll attempt to answer it myself.

The designer of the 50 francs banknote featuring the Little Prince was Czesław Słania.

Question: What day, month, and year did William II of Holland become King of Germany?

William II of Holland became King of Germany in 1248.

Question: In what month and year did Wangchuk start a project called the Ice Stupa?
Gold-standard answer: January 2014.
