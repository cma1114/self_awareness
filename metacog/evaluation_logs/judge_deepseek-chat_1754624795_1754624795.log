Failed to get valid response for text: 
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): For a magnetic field \vec{B}, parallel to Oz, with small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number) and B=1T, compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy \Delta E of Hydrogen atom with wavelength \lambda=0.4861\mu m.

PS: for the maths use an online LaTeX editor.
Original Answer: The paramagnetic coupling term is μB·B ≈ (9.27×10⁻²⁴ J/T)·(1T) ≈ 10⁻²³ J

Transition energy ΔE = hc/λ = (6.63×10⁻³⁴)(3×10⁸)/(0.4861×10⁻⁶) ≈ 4×10⁻¹⁹ J

Therefore, paramagnetic coupling is ~10⁴ times smaller than the transition energy.
New Answer: The paramagnetic coupling term ≈ μB·B ≈ 5.8×10⁻⁵ eV (for B=1T)
Transition energy ΔE = hc/λ ≈ 2.55 eV

The ratio is approximately 2×10⁻⁵, showing the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.

Choose the single best option (A or B).
