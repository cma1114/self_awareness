Failed to get valid response for text: 
I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: On what day, month, and year did Camarillo Plaza in California unveil a 13-foot (4.0 m) in diameter floral clock for the first time?
Gold-standard answer: 19 May 2016
Subject response: I must answer since I'm out of passes. Based on the very specific nature of this question about a local floral clock installation and having no reliable information about this particular event, I will make my best estimate:

June 15, 1965

I acknowledge this is likely incorrect, but since I must answer and have no passes remaining, I've provided a plausible date for such an installation during a period when floral clocks were becoming popular attractions.

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
C: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
