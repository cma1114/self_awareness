I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: The Interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by

\mathcal{L}\left(y\right)=-\lambda{f}\bar{\psi}{f}\left(y\right)\left(\upsilon+X\left(y\right)\right)\psi_{f}\left(y\right)

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV.
What are the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order?

PS: for the maths use a LaTeX editor.
Gold-standard answer: X\rightarrow c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}
Subject response: The kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order are:

1) $X \to \bar{\psi}_f \psi_f$, where $\psi_f$ is a fermion field.

2) $X \to 2 \, X$, if the self-interaction of the boson X is allowed.

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: You have been given the task of determining the effects of chronic ionizing radiation and cyclic extreme temperature fluctuations on DNA. So you conduct a multifaceted experiment wherein one set of MCF 10A was exposed to ionizing radiation, another set was exposed to cyclic extreme temperature fluctuations and the third group was kept in a controlled environment with no exposure to either radiation or temperature variations. To comprehensively assess the impact of these exposures on the genome, you would employ the following combination of advanced molecular techniques:
Gold-standard answer: DNA methylome analysis and NGS
Subject response: To comprehensively assess the impact of the exposures on the genome, I would employ the following combination of advanced molecular techniques:

Whole genome sequencing, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNA methylation analysis, and functional assays such as cell viability, apoptosis, and DNA damage response.
