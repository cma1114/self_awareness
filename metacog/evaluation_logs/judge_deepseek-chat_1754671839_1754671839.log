Failed to get valid response for text: 
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): Who was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive?
Original Answer: Giorgio Vasari, though he included his own biography in his "Lives of the Artists" (1550/1568). If referring to a biography written by someone else about a living artist, it was likely Albrecht DÃ¼rer.
New Answer: Giorgio Vasari.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
