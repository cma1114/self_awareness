You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.
Original Answer: The speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is (n - v/c).
New Answer: (n - v)

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.

Question Text (for context):  Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.
Original Answer: $v_max = \sqrt{\frac{2kA^2}{m}}\left(1 - \frac{2kA^2}{mc^2}\right)^{-1/2}$
New Answer: $v_max = \sqrt{2A\omega/m}$, where $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.

Question Text (for context): Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$

Original Answer: The magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at the point P outside the spherical conductor is given by:

$E = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left[\frac{1}{l^2} - \frac{1}{L^2}\right]$

where $l$ is the distance from the point P to the center of the cavity, and $L$ is the distance from the point P to the center of the spherical conductor.
New Answer: $\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{l^2}-\frac{1}{L^2}\right)\cos\theta$

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.

Question Text (for context): Consider an electron fixed at the origin, and a magnetic field (with constant magnitude B_0 and aligned at an angle \theta with the z-axis) processes with a frequency \omega about the z-axis. Assume that \omega is much less than eB0/m (e is electronic charge and m is electron's mass). If the electron is initially in the spin-up state, then, in time-asymptotic limit,
Original Answer: In the time-asymptotic limit, the electron's spin will precess around the magnetic field with a frequency of ω, and the electron will remain in the spin-up state.
New Answer: The electron will be in the spin-down state.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
