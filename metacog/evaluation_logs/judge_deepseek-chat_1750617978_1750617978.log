I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Which of the following sequences is correctly ordered by their distance from the Sun? When a parameter is not mentioned, assume it is zero. For the stars in the Solar Neighborhood (distance < 500 pc), assume that the total absorption in the V band relates to the color excess of the B-V color with an Rv value of 3.1.


a) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magnitude of 8 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
b) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
c) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 9 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
d) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
e) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
f) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magnitude of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
Gold-standard answer: d < b < f < c
Subject response: c, a, f, b, d, e

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?

Gold-standard answer: Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
Subject response: The most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results is that Hi-C captures population-averaged interactions, while FISH reflects individual cell variability. The interaction may be present in only a subset of cells, leading to a strong Hi-C signal but no consistent colocalization in FISH

Question: Suppose we have a depolarizing channel operation given by E(\rho). The probability, p, of the depolarisation state represents the strength of the noise. If the Kraus operators of the given state are, A{0}=\sqrt{1-\frac{3p}{4}} , A{1}=\sqrt{\frac{p}{4}}X, A{2}=\sqrt{\frac{p}{4}}Y and A{3}=\sqrt{\frac{p}{4}}Z. What could be the correct Kraus Representation of the state E(\rho). (Use latex)
Gold-standard answer: E(\rho)=(1-p)\rho+\frac{p}{3}X\rho X+\frac{p}{3}Y\rho Y+\frac{p}{3}Z\rho Z
Subject response: E(\rho) = \sum_{k=0}^{3} A_k \rho A_k^\dagger

where \( A_0 = \sqrt{1 - \frac{3p}{4}} I \), \( A_1 = \sqrt{\frac{p}{4}} X \), \( A_2 = \sqrt{\frac{p}{4}} Y \), and \( A_3 = \sqrt{\frac{p}{4}} Z \)

B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
