Failed to get valid response for text: 
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): The state $\psi$ of a system is given in terms of a complete and orthonormal set of basis vectors $|\phi_1>,  |\phi_2>,  |\phi_3>$ and $| \phi_4 >$ as $|\psi> = \sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>$. The basis vectors $|\phi_n>$ are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator $H$ satisfying $H |\phi_n> = n E_o |\phi_n>; n=1, 2, 3, 4. Calculate the average energy of the system in some repeated measurements. 

Original Answer: The average energy is given by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator, \(\langle H \rangle = \sum_n |c_n|^2 E_n\), where \(c_n\) are the coefficients of the state in the basis of eigenstates, and \(E_n = n E_o\).

Given the state \(|\psi\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{15}} |\phi_1\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{15}} |\phi_2\rangle + \frac{2}{\sqrt{15}} |\phi_3\rangle + \frac{4}{\sqrt{15}} |\phi_4\rangle\), the probabilities are:
- \(|c_1|^2 = \frac{1}{15}\)
- \(|c_2|^2 = \frac{2}{15}\)
- \(|c_3|^2 = \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{15}}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{15}\)
- \(|c_4|^2 = \left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{15}}\right)^2 = \frac{16}{15}\)

However, the sum of probabilities must be 1. Let's normalize the state. Total probability:
\(\frac{1}{15} + \frac{2}{15} + \frac{4}{15} + \frac{16}{15} = \frac{23}{15} \neq 1\). This indicates a possible error in the problem statement. Assuming the intent was for the state to be normalized, let's compute with given coefficients and check.

Recalculating the sum of squared coefficients:
\(\frac{1}{15} + \frac{2}{15} + \frac{4}{15} + \frac{16}{15} = \frac{23}{15}\), which is incorrect for a normalized state. Let's assume the coefficients are meant to be normalized. Correcting the normalization factor, total probability should be 1, so let's compute the expectation value directly with given coefficients and normalize.

Since the problem likely has a typo, let's assume the state is meant to be normalized by dividing by \(\sqrt{\frac{23}{15}}\), but for simplicity, compute directly:

\(\langle H \rangle = \sum |c_n|^2 n E_o = \left(\frac{1}{15} \cdot 1 + \frac{2}{15} \cdot 2 + \frac{4}{15} \cdot 3 + \frac{16}{15} \cdot 4\right) E_o\)

= \(\left(\frac{1 + 4 + 12 + 64}{15}\right) E_o = \frac{81}{15} E_o = \frac{27}{5} E_o\)

However, since normalization is incorrect, the correct approach is to normalize first, but assuming intent, the answer with given coefficients yields:

Correcting normalization, total probability sum = 23/15, so normalize coefficients by multiplying by \(\sqrt{\frac{15}{23}}\), but it's easier to compute directly as proportional.

Correct expectation value:
\(\langle H \rangle = \frac{\sum |c_n|^2 E_n}{\sum |c_n|^2} = \frac{\frac{81}{15} E_o}{\frac{23}{15}} = \frac{81}{23} E_o\)

So, average energy = \(\frac{81}{23} E_o\).
New Answer: The average energy is calculated as the expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator \( H \). Given the state \( |\psi\rangle = \sum_{n=1}^{4} c_n |\phi_n\rangle \), where \( c_1 = \sqrt{1/15} \), \( c_2 = \sqrt{2/15} \), \( c_3 = 2/\sqrt{15} \), and \( c_4 = 4/\sqrt{15} \), and the energy eigenvalues are \( E_n = n E_o \), the average energy is:

\[
\langle E \rangle = \sum_{n=1}^{4} |c_n|^2 E_n = \left( \frac{1}{15} \cdot 1 E_o \right) + \left( \frac{2}{15} \cdot 2 E_o \right) + \left( \frac{4}{15} \cdot 3 E_o \right) + \left( \frac{16}{15} \cdot 4 E_o \right)
\]

Calculating the sum:

\[
\langle E \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{15} + \frac{4}{15} + \frac{12}{15} + \frac{64}{15} \right) E_o = \frac{81}{15} E_o = \frac{27}{5} E_o
\]

So, the average energy is \( \frac{27}{5} E_o \).

Question Text (for context): The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?

Original Answer: The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for unipolar charge transport in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, assuming a trap-free material, ohmic contacts, and negligible diffusion currents.
