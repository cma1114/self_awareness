Failed to get valid response for text: 
I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?
Gold-standard answer: 4 π
Subject response: The divergence of a radial vector field \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2} \) is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 f_r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2}) = 0
\]

Since the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin, the volume integral of the divergence over a sphere of radius \( R \) is:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_V 0 \, dV = 0
\]

Therefore, the most appropriate answer for the integral is 0.

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
