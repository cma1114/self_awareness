I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Diamond and graphite are present in the same magma chamber of a volcano. The diamond and graphite are in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium in the magma chamber when the temperature increases by 100.0 K. By how much the pressure should change in order to maintain the thermodynamic equilibrium between the diamond and the graphite? The molar volume of diamond is 3.417 cm³/mol and the molar entropy of diamond is 2.38 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹. The molar volume of graphite is 5.298 cm³/mol and the molar entropy of graphite is 5.74 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.

Gold-standard answer: The pressure has to increase by 1786 bar.
Subject response: Answer: 1.88e8 Pa

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: Researchers are attempting to detect the spectroscopic effects caused by the transits of two planets (Planet_1 and Planet_2), as they orbit distinct stars (Star_1 and Star_2). They are using a spectrograph with limited spectral resolution, attached to a telescope with constrained light-collecting capability. Given the restricted available observation time, the researchers aim to select the planet/star system that can generate the highest detectable signal.

Regarding the two stars, it is established that they share the same spectral type, apparent magnitude, and activity level, implying that the "signal" and "noise" originating from these stars are equivalent and can be ignored. Additionally, it's noted that Star_1 has a radius two times greater than that of Star_2 and exhibits a rotational speed three times faster. Accurate rotational velocities are available for both stars.

As for the planets, it is found that Planet_1 surpasses Planet_2 in size by a factor of four. Furthermore, it's confirmed that during their transits, these planets pass through the centers of their respective stars i.e. impact parameter = 0. Which system should the astronomers observe first and why?
Gold-standard answer: Planet_1 because its semi-amplitude signal in RV is 12 times larger.
Subject response: Star_2/Planet_2 system. Larger transit depth due to smaller star.
