You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?
Original Answer: The number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This is because the volume of space increases with the cube of the distance (which is the inverse of parallax), and the number of stars is proportional to this volume.
New Answer: The number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the square of the parallax. This is because parallax is inversely related to distance, and the volume of space (hence the number of stars) increases with the cube of the distance.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.

Question Text (for context): A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.
3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine
Original Answer: A suitable reagent (A) is cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde, and the catalyst (B) is an acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH).
New Answer: Reagent (A) is cyclohexanone, and the catalyst (B) is an acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH).
