I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,
|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;
Here, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.
N = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).
The relative entropy measure is given as,
del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]
where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.
Calculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.
Gold-standard answer: 1.38
Subject response: I will pass on this question. The calculation of non-Gaussianity for a specific quantum state using relative entropy measure involves advanced quantum optics and mathematics, which is beyond my current capabilities.

A: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)

Question: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?

Gold-standard answer: The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
Subject response: The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under the following assumptions:

1) The charge carrier mobility is constant and independent of the electric field.
2) The charge carriers are injected from the contacts into the semiconductor with negligible injection barrier.
3) The semiconductor material is trap-free, and there are no other sources or sinks of charge carriers within the bulk.
4) The electric field distribution is governed by the space charge of the injected carriers, and the device operates in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime.

If these assumptions hold, the Mott-Gurney equation accurately describes the quadratic dependence of the current density on the applied voltage in the SCLC regime.

Question: During a quantum communication task of a quantum dialogue for a two-mode entangled squeezed continuous variable state under noiseless quantum channel such that the two modes generated are maximally correlated given the condition, r-> inf for the squeezing operator S(r). What would be the Bell basis measurement outcome after a homodyne detection is performed, if Alice encodes the same value as Bob (alpha) in both quadratures x & p using a displacement operator D(alpha)? (Here alpha = x1 + i p1)"
Gold-standard answer: (0,2*p1)
Subject response: I will pass on this question as it involves highly technical details of quantum communication and quantum optics that I do not have the specialized knowledge to accurately answer.
