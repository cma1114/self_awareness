I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: A chemist performs two reactions:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. 

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.

Both reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.

Assuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?
Gold-standard answer: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC
Subject response: Achiral HPLC: 1 peak
Chiral HPLC: 4 peaks

(The epoxidation/ring-opening creates 2 stereocenters, and starting with E vs Z alkenes leads to different diastereomers, giving 4 total stereoisomers)

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>
Gold-standard answer: U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
Subject response: \left|\psi_{out}\right\rangle = \alpha\left|0\right\rangle\left|1\right\rangle + (\beta-\gamma)\left|1\right\rangle\left|0\right\rangle

A: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)

Question: Astronomers are studying a star with a Teff of approximately 6000 K. They are interested in spectroscopically determining the surface gravity of the star using spectral lines (EW < 100 mA) of two chemical elements, El1 and El2. Given the atmospheric temperature of the star, El1 is mostly in the neutral phase, while El2 is mostly ionized. Which lines are the most sensitive to surface gravity for the astronomers to consider?
Gold-standard answer: El1 II (singly ionized)
Subject response: The ionized lines of El2 would be most sensitive to surface gravity.

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: Consider this quantum state 

$\left|\psi\right\rangle =\frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\left(\left|00\right\rangle +\left|01\right\rangle \right)+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\left(\left|10\right\rangle +\left|11\right\rangle \right)$

Is this state entangled? Why?
Gold-standard answer: Yes, because it does not satisfy the separability criterion.
Subject response: No, it's not entangled. It can be factored as: $(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}|0⟩ + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}|1⟩) \otimes (|0⟩ + |1⟩)$

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
