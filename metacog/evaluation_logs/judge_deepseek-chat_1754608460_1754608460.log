You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): Consider a Fermi gas of N relativistic electrons, confined as a spherical cloud (of radius R) of uniform mass density. The outward pressure exerted by this gas in the ground state is compensated by the gravitational pressure acting inward. Therefore, in equilibrium, the ground state pressure becomes proportional to a function of the mass M of the gas and the radius R. The form of this function is
Original Answer: M^2/R^4
New Answer: M^(2/3)/R^4

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.

Question Text (for context): "Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:
At the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.
At the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.
At the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.
At the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.
At the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3
Which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?


Original Answer: The Ct values are increasing as concentration increases, which is the opposite of what should happen. There's likely a mix-up in sample labeling or a data entry error.
New Answer: The Ct values are increasing with increasing concentration.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.

Question Text (for context): Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.
Original Answer: System 1 is approximately 0.44 times as massive as System 2.
New Answer: 2.67

Question Text (for context): On sequencing the genome of a new fungal species, it was observed that the largest chromosome (chr1) is 4 Mb and the second largest chromosome (chr2) is 3.7 Mb. It was also observed that a part of chr1 of size 300 kb is duplicated and the two copies are placed in tandem on the same chromosome. How can the tandem duplication on chr1 be experimentally validated?
Original Answer: PCR amplification across the duplicated region, followed by gel electrophoresis to confirm the expected larger product size.
New Answer: PCR with primers flanking the duplication, followed by Sanger sequencing of the amplicon. Expect a larger than predicted amplicon size.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
