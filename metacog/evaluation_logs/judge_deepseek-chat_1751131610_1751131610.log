Question: Consider the following metric:

ds^{2}=\frac{32}{\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\right)}\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\right)

What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?

PS: for the maths use a LaTeX editor.
Gold-standard answer: +\infty
Subject response: The given metric is $ds^{2}=\frac{32}{\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\right)}\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\right)$.
To find the area, we need to integrate the area element $dA = \sqrt{\det(g_{ij})} dx dy$.
The metric tensor $g_{ij}$ for this 2D metric is diagonal, with $g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$.
So, $\det(g_{ij}) = \left(\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\right)^2$.
The area element is $dA = \sqrt{\left(\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\right)^2} dx dy = \frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} dx dy$.

The term "pseudosphere of radius r=2" implies that the domain of integration is the disk $x^2+y^2 < 2^2 = 4$.
It is convenient to convert to polar coordinates: $x = \rho \cos\phi$, $y = \rho \sin\phi$, so $x^2+y^2 = \rho^2$, and $dx dy = \rho d\rho d\phi$.
The area integral becomes:
$A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4-\rho^2} \rho d\rho d\phi$

First, evaluate the inner integral with respect to $\rho$:
$\int_0^2 \frac{32\rho}{4-\rho^2} d\rho$
Let $u = 4-\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\rho d\rho$, so $\rho d\rho = -\frac{1}{2} du$.
When $\rho=0$, $u=4$. When $\rho=2$, $u=0$.
The integral becomes:
$\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \left(-\frac{1}{2} du\right) = \int_0^4 \frac{16}{u} du$

This is an improper integral:
$\lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \int_\epsilon^4 \frac{16}{u} du = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} [16 \ln|u|]_\epsilon^4$
$= \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} (16 \ln 4 - 16 \ln \epsilon)$
As $\epsilon \to 0^+$, $\ln \epsilon \to -\infty$.
Therefore, the integral diverges to $+\infty$.

Since the inner integral diverges, the total area is infinite.
It's worth noting that a true pseudosphere (a surface of constant negative Gaussian curvature) has a finite area ($2\pi R^2$ for a pseudosphere of radius $R$). However, the given metric $ds^{2}=\frac{32}{\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\right)}\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\right)$ does not have constant Gaussian curvature. Its Gaussian curvature is $K = -\frac{1}{4(4-x^2-y^2)}$, which varies with $x$ and $y$. The question likely refers to the area of the surface defined by this specific metric over the disk of radius 2.

Question: Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.
Gold-standard answer: 0.506 \lambda / a
