You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.
Original Answer: To find the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges. For a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), an image charge \( q' = -\frac{R}{d}q \) is placed inside the sphere at a distance \( \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center.

The potential energy \( U \) of the system is given by the interaction between the real charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \):

\[
U = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q \cdot q'}{d - \frac{R^2}{d}}
\]

Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R}{d}q \), the potential energy becomes:

\[
U = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q \left(-\frac{R}{d}q\right)}{d - \frac{R^2}{d}} = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}
\]

This is the net potential energy of the system.
New Answer: \(-\frac{q^2 R}{2d(d-R)}\)

Question Text (for context): Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?
Original Answer: The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital period, assuming the same albedo and stellar luminosity. Given the orbital period ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is 3.5:2, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the inverse of this ratio:

\[
\text{Temperature ratio} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3.5}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{7}}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \(\sqrt{\frac{4}{7}}\).
New Answer: (2/3.5)^(1/3)
