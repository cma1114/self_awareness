Failed to get valid response for text: 
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?
Original Answer: In a parallel universe with isolated magnetic poles, the equations of Gauss's law for magnetism and Ampère's law would be different from the standard Maxwell's equations.
New Answer: In a parallel universe with isolated magnetic poles, the Maxwell equation that would be different is Gauss's law for magnetism. Specifically, the equation ∇ · B = 0, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, would need to be modified to account for the existence of isolated magnetic monopoles.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.

Choose the single best option (A or B).
