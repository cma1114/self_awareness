I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Researchers are attempting to detect the spectroscopic effects caused by the transits of two planets (Planet_1 and Planet_2), as they orbit distinct stars (Star_1 and Star_2). They are using a spectrograph with limited spectral resolution, attached to a telescope with constrained light-collecting capability. Given the restricted available observation time, the researchers aim to select the planet/star system that can generate the highest detectable signal.

Regarding the two stars, it is established that they share the same spectral type, apparent magnitude, and activity level, implying that the "signal" and "noise" originating from these stars are equivalent and can be ignored. Additionally, it's noted that Star_1 has a radius two times greater than that of Star_2 and exhibits a rotational speed three times faster. Accurate rotational velocities are available for both stars.

As for the planets, it is found that Planet_1 surpasses Planet_2 in size by a factor of four. Furthermore, it's confirmed that during their transits, these planets pass through the centers of their respective stars i.e. impact parameter = 0. Which system should the astronomers observe first and why?
Gold-standard answer: Planet_1 because its semi-amplitude signal in RV is 12 times larger.
Subject response: ANSWER: Observe the Planet_2/Star_2 system first. The signal for a transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio. Since Star_2 has a smaller radius (half of Star_1), the ratio for Planet_2/Star_2 is larger than for Planet_1/Star_1, despite Planet_1 being larger. This results in a stronger transit signal for Planet_2/Star_2.

Question: A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?
Gold-standard answer: 1/r.
Subject response: 1/r²

Explanation: Given the probability is constant over equal intervals of radius (between d1 to 2*d1 and 2*d1 to 3*d1), the probability density must be proportional to 1/r² to account for the increasing volume element (4πr² dr) in spherical coordinates. Thus, the wave function, being real and spherically symmetric, should be proportional to 1/r to ensure the probability density (|ψ|²) is proportional to 1/r².

Question: Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$

Gold-standard answer: $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$
Subject response: The magnitude of the electric field \(\vec{E}\) at point P outside the spherical conductor is \(\frac{kq}{L^2}\), where \(k\) is Coulomb's constant. This is because the conductor is uncharged, and the charge inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor, with the net effect being that the field outside behaves as if the charge \(+q\) is at the center of the conductor.

Question: Suppose AGNs emitted all their energy output in the form of electromagnetic radiation isotropically (e.g., without prominent jets), and we had perfect detectors that could measure this radiation across the spectrum without obstacles. 
Suppose that we can measure the mass of the supermassive black hole in AGNs almost exactly, as well as the distance of AGN.

Then, we examine the plot with mass of the AGN black hole on the horizontal axis, and bolometric luminosity of AGN on the vertical axis. 
If hypothetically: 
All AGNs with a Schwarzschild black hole, lie on a power-law line with practically no scatter; all AGNs with a Kerr black hole with a spin a=1 (very close to 1) and prograde rotation, also lie on a power-law line with practically no scatter.
How are the two lines positioned with respect to each other?
Gold-standard answer: The 2nd line (Kerr line) is above the 1st line (by a factor of 5 to 10).
Subject response: The line for Kerr black holes (with spin a=1 and prograde rotation) would be positioned above the line for Schwarzschild black holes on the plot. This is because Kerr black holes, due to their spin, can have higher accretion efficiency, leading to greater bolometric luminosity for the same black hole mass compared to non-spinning Schwarzschild black holes.
