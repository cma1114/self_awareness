I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Consider a quantum field which extends into a closed, space-like extra dimension of radius R. What pattern of particle masses is expected, and how do they depend on R?
Gold-standard answer: Tower of linearly-spaced masses, proportional to 1/R
Subject response: Answer: Kaluza-Klein modes, masses proportional to n/R, where n is an integer

A: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)

Question: Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$

Gold-standard answer: $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$
Subject response: Answer: $\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 L^2}$

A: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)

Question: Let a pendulum consist of an object hanging from a support, such that its lagrangian is given by 1/2*M*R*R*theta-dot*theta-dot - 4/3*M*g*R*(1-cos(theta)). The pendulum is released from rest, at an initial angle alpha. An expression for the period of the pendulum is given by the integral of which integrand? (In the previous expression, theta-dot represents the time derivative of the angle between pendulum and vertical, theta). 
Gold-standard answer: sqrt(6*R/g) / sqrt((cos(theta) - cos(alpha)))
Subject response: Answer: sqrt(3/(2*g*R))*1/sqrt(cos(theta)-cos(alpha))

A: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
