Failed to get valid response for text: 
I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.
Gold-standard answer: (1+n*v)/(n+v)
Subject response: (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n)

This is the relativistic velocity addition formula for light in a moving medium.

A: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)

Question: A chemist is synthesizing an RNA nucleoside phoshoramidite from a β-D-ribonucleoside.

First, they install the DMTr protecting group on the 5'-OH. Next, they treat the 5’-ODMTr ribonucleoside with 1.1 eq of TBDMSCl; two products are formed (products 1 and 2). They isolate the two products and take the 2D COSY NMR spectrum of each.

Important features of the COSY spectrum of product 1 are: 
*A correlation between a 1H doublet at approx. 6 ppm (Ha) and a 1H doublet-of-doublets at approx. 4.5 ppm (Hb)
*A correlation between Hb and a broad singlet at approx. 5.5 ppm
*A correlation between Hb and another 1H doublet-of-doublets at approx. 4.5 ppm (Hc)

They discard product 2 and take product 1 through to the final nucleoside phosphoramidite by treating it with 2-cyanoethyl N,N-diisopropylchlorophosphoramidite. They then use this phosphoramidite to synthesize an RNA oligo using standard solid-phase methodology.

If they compare their synthetic RNA oligo with a naturally occurring RNA oligo with exactly the same types and sequence of bases, what is the relationship?
Gold-standard answer: Regioisomers
Subject response: They are identical. Product 1 has TBDMS on 2'-OH (shown by COSY correlations), which is the correct regioisomer needed for RNA synthesis, leading to natural RNA after deprotection.

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: Consider this quantum state 

$\left|\psi\right\rangle =\frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\left(\left|00\right\rangle +\left|01\right\rangle \right)+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\left(\left|10\right\rangle +\left|11\right\rangle \right)$

Is this state entangled? Why?
Gold-standard answer: Yes, because it does not satisfy the separability criterion.
Subject response: No, because it can be factored into separate states for each qubit: $(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}|0⟩ + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}|1⟩) \otimes (|0⟩ + |1⟩)$
