I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Consider this quantum state 

$\left|\psi\right\rangle =\frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\left(\left|00\right\rangle +\left|01\right\rangle \right)+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\left(\left|10\right\rangle +\left|11\right\rangle \right)$

Is this state entangled? Why?
Gold-standard answer: Yes, because it does not satisfy the separability criterion.
Subject response: No, because it can be factored into a product state: (√6/6|0⟩ + √3/3|1⟩) ⊗ (|0⟩ + |1⟩)

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.

A variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?
Gold-standard answer: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
Subject response: The energy spectrum of E particles will be discrete (a sharp peak) in the case with one M particle, rather than continuous, because with only one massless particle M, conservation of energy and momentum uniquely determines the energies of all outgoing particles.

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: "Scientist aims to detect Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater. He took two wastewater samples (sample A and sample B) from two different sites.
For sample A, he used polyethylene glycol (PEG) for viral concentration, then he used an RNA extraction kit for RNA extraction. He found that A260/280 for extracted RNA was 2.1. Then, he converted RNA to cDNA using a reverse transcription kit. Then, he runs loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction with the help of methyl red dye. He noticed that there there is no color change of the dye at the end of the LAMP reaction. Then, he runs a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on the cDNA, and found that ct is 20 knowing that the cut-off for ct value of this kit is 40.
For sample B, he used Centricon Plus-70 Centrifugal Filter 100 kDa MWCO Millipore for viral concentration, then the scientist used the same RNA extraction kit for RNA extraction. He found that A260/280 for extracted RNA was 2.2. Then, he converted RNA to cDNA using the same reverse transcription kit. Then, he runs loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction under the same conditions with the help of methyl red dye. He noticed that the color of the dye had changed at the end of LAMP reaction. Then, he runs a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with the same condition and found that ct is 22 knowing that the cut-off for the ct value of this kit is 40.
Which of the following statement best to describes the negative LAMP result of sample A?
Gold-standard answer: pH of the first sample A is very alkaline ( pH =9)
Subject response: The negative LAMP result for sample A despite positive qPCR (Ct=20) suggests that the LAMP assay has lower sensitivity than qPCR, as LAMP can sometimes miss positive samples that qPCR can detect.

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: Parallax of a star is measured to be 2 milliarcseconds. By what factor does the brightness (i.e. the flux of the photons we receive on Earth) of the star change, if we place it at a distance of 20 parsecs?


Gold-standard answer: ~620
Subject response: The flux decreases by a factor of 100. 

(Since flux ∝ 1/d², and the distance increases by a factor of 10 from 0.5 kpc to 20 kpc)
