You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): Consider a stack of N optical layers (made of a material of refractive index n), separated by air gaps. The thickness of each layer is t_1 and that of each gap is t_2. A plane wave (of wavelength \lambda) is incident normally on this stack. If the optical thickness of each layer and each gap is given by a quarter of \lambda, the transmissivity of the entire stack is given by [when n^(2N) >> 1]
Original Answer: Approximately 4/(n^(2N))
New Answer: 4n^(2N)

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.

Question Text (for context): Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.
Original Answer: System 1 is approximately 0.44 times as massive as System 2.
New Answer: 2.67

Question Text (for context): On sequencing the genome of a new fungal species, it was observed that the largest chromosome (chr1) is 4 Mb and the second largest chromosome (chr2) is 3.7 Mb. It was also observed that a part of chr1 of size 300 kb is duplicated and the two copies are placed in tandem on the same chromosome. How can the tandem duplication on chr1 be experimentally validated?
Original Answer: PCR amplification across the duplicated region, followed by gel electrophoresis to confirm the expected larger product size.
New Answer: Southern blot, PCR, or cytological analysis (FISH).

Question Text (for context): Scientist 1 is studying linkage maps in Drosophila. Specifically, Scientist 1 is working out the linkage between 3 genes in one cross, also known as a three-point testcross. The genes under study are V, CV, and CT. To obtain the required information a trihybrid female and a tester male (triple recessive male) are crossed. Analyzing the information from this cross, the genetic mapping and the genetic map units (m.u.) read as follows:

V - - CT - CV
V -> CV: 18.5%
V -> CT: 13.2%
CV -> CT: 6.4 %

Scientist 1 questioned the data, asking, "Why was the addition of V -> CT and CV -> CT (13.2% + 6.4%) greater than the m.u. for V -> CV (18.5%)?
Original Answer: Double crossovers occurred between V and CV.
New Answer: Double crossovers between V and CV are not accounted for in the direct V -> CV calculation.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
