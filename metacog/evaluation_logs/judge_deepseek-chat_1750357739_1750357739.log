I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: You have prepared an unknown alkane compound. You started with heptane (C7H16) and through several reactions some of the hydrogens have been replaced. The replaced hydrogens have been replaced by either –CH3, –CH2R, –CHR2, or –CR3 groups, where R is non-hydrogen.  

A 1H NMR spectrum of the product was obtained. The multiplicities of the signals due to the hydrogens on carbon-1 through to carbon-7 of the starting heptane backbone are as follows:

t, dq, dt, ddt, ddd, ddt, d
(i.e. Carbon-1 = t (triplet), Carbon-2 = dq (double of quartets), etc

Identify which groups (out of the options –CH3, –CH2R, –CHR2, or –CR3) must be placed on which carbon (numbered 1 to 7 from left to right) in order that the multiplicities of the 1H NMR are achieved.

(“no change” below indicates that the carbon retains its 2 hydrogens. If only one change is made to a carbon, then it still retains its other hydrogen).
Gold-standard answer: Carbon 1: no change
Carbon 2: no change
Carbon 3: –CR3
Carbon 4: –CH2R
Carbon 5: –CHR2
Carbon 6: –CHR2
Carbon 7: –CR3
Subject response: Carbon-1: -CH3
Carbon-2: no change
Carbon-3: -CHR2
Carbon-4: -CH2R
Carbon-5: -CHR2
Carbon-6: -CH2R
Carbon-7: no change

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: A spherical shell with a radius R has an electric charge distribution on its surface. The surface charge density is described by σ(θ)=4 cos(θ), where θ is the angle with respect to z-axis. There are no charges inside or outside the shell, and there's a vacuum in the surrounding space. The goal is to determine the electric potential inside (φ_in) and outside (φ_out) the spherical shell.


Gold-standard answer: φ_in = (4r/3ε0)cos(θ) , φ_out = (4R^3/3ε0 r^2)cos(θ)
Subject response: Inside the shell (r < R):
φ_in = 0

Outside the shell (r > R):
φ_out = (1/4πε_0) * (Q/r)

Where:
Q is the total charge on the shell, given by Q = ∫∫ σ(θ) R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ
ε_0 is the permittivity of free space.

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory? Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.

Paranal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory
W. M. Keck Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._M._Keck_Observatory


Star1 - RA = 15 deg and DEC = -75 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.

Star2 - RA = 30 deg and DEC = 55 deg, apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.

Star3 - RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.

Star4 - RA = 85 deg and DEC = -48 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.

Star5 - RA = 10 h and DEC = 60 deg, absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.
Gold-standard answer: Star3 and Star5

Question: Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?
Gold-standard answer: ~0.83
Subject response: The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately (3.5/2)^(1/4) ≈ 1.29.
