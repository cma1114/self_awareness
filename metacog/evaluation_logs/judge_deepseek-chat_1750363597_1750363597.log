Failed to get valid response for text: 
I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Suppose we have a depolarizing channel operation given by E(\rho). The probability, p, of the depolarisation state represents the strength of the noise. If the Kraus operators of the given state are, A{0}=\sqrt{1-\frac{3p}{4}} , A{1}=\sqrt{\frac{p}{4}}X, A{2}=\sqrt{\frac{p}{4}}Y and A{3}=\sqrt{\frac{p}{4}}Z. What could be the correct Kraus Representation of the state E(\rho). (Use latex)
Gold-standard answer: E(\rho)=(1-p)\rho+\frac{p}{3}X\rho X+\frac{p}{3}Y\rho Y+\frac{p}{3}Z\rho Z
Subject response: The Kraus representation of the depolarizing channel E(\rho) with probability p is given by:

E(\rho) = (1-p)\rho + \frac{p}{3}(X\rho X + Y\rho Y + Z\rho Z)

Where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices:

X = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, Y = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0  
\end{pmatrix}, Z = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}

The Kraus operators are:

A_0 = \sqrt{1-\frac{3p}{4}}I, A_1 = \sqrt{\frac{p}{4}}X, A_2 = \sqrt{\frac{p}{4}}Y, A_3 = \sqrt{\frac{p}{4}}Z

Where I is the identity matrix.

So the given Kraus operators in the question are correct.

A: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
