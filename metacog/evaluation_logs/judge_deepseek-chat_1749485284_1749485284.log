Failed to get valid response for text: 
I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Consider this quantum state 

$\left|\psi\right\rangle =\frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\left(\left|00\right\rangle +\left|01\right\rangle \right)+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\left(\left|10\right\rangle +\left|11\right\rangle \right)$

Is this state entangled? Why?
Gold-standard answer: Yes, because it does not satisfy the separability criterion.
Subject response: No, because it can be factored into a product state: (√6/6|0⟩ + √3/3|1⟩) ⊗ (|0⟩ + |1⟩)

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?
Gold-standard answer: ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]
Subject response: T₁ = 2T₂

This follows from the Boltzmann equation for excited states, where the ratio of populations is proportional to e^(-ΔE/kT), and given that the ratio is 2, T₁ must be twice T₂.
