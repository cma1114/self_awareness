Failed to get valid response for text: 
I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: Among the following stars, which one will appear redder than if it were located next to the Sun? Please assume that all the stars have the same parallax (1 milliarcsecond) and the same RV of 40 km/s.

star1: l = -10 deg, b = 1 deg, Teff = 5600 K, [Fe/H] = 0.2 dex, logg = 4.4 dex
star2: l = -100 deg, b = 20 deg, Teff = 4700 K, [Fe/H] = 0.1 dex, logg = 4.2 dex
star3: l = -100 deg, b = 15 deg, Teff = 3650 K, [Fe/H] = -0.2 dex, logg = 4.3 dex
star4: l =  150 deg, b = 10 deg, Teff = 5800 K, [Fe/H] = -0.05 dex, logg = 4.45 dex


Gold-standard answer: Star1
Subject response: star1 will appear redder due to its location near the galactic plane (b = 1 deg) where interstellar extinction and reddening are strongest. While star3 has the lowest temperature (making it intrinsically redder), the much higher galactic latitude of the other stars means they experience less interstellar reddening. The extreme reddening effect near the galactic plane (where star1 is located) will dominate over intrinsic stellar color differences.

A: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)
