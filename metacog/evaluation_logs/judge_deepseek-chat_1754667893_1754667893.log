You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if a subject's `new_answer` is semantically the same as their `original_answer` for a given `question_text`.
Focus on semantic equivalence. Ignore minor wording or punctuation differences if the core meaning is the same.

- If the `new_answer` conveys the same essential information or meaning as the `original_answer`, they are considered "SAME".
- If the `new_answer` conveys different information, adds substantive new information that changes the core meaning, or omits substantive information from the `original_answer` leading to a different core meaning, they are considered "DIFFERENT".
- If either answer is not a substantive attempt (e.g., blank, "I don't know"), consider that. For example:
    - If `original_answer` is "Paris" and `new_answer` is "I don't know", they are "DIFFERENT".
    - If `original_answer` is "I don't know" and `new_answer` is also "I don't know" (or blank), they are "SAME" in their non-attempt.
    - If `original_answer` is blank and `new_answer` is "Paris", they are "DIFFERENT".

Question Text (for context): A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:
Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.
Which combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?
Original Answer: **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions; reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.

In basic solutions, OH⁻ ions stabilize reduced oxygen species, making O₂ a weaker oxidant thermodynamically. Kinetically, O₂ reduction is slower in acidic solutions due to the multi-electron transfer mechanism being less favorable.
New Answer: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.

Question Text (for context): In the vacuum, we have the following mixture

$\left|\nu_{i}\left(x\right)\right\rangle =e^{ip_{1}x}\cos\theta\left|\nu_{1}\right\rangle +e^{ip_{2}x}\sin\theta\left|\nu_{2}\right\rangle $

where $i=e,\mu,\nu, \theta the mixing angle, and \nu_{1} and \nu_{2}$ are the basis of mass eigenstates.

At what value of the mixing angle we will obtain the transition probability $P\left(\nu_{e}\rightarrow\nu_{\mu}\right)=1$.
Original Answer: At θ = π/4 (45°).

At this mixing angle, cos θ = sin θ = 1/√2, which maximizes the oscillation amplitude and allows the transition probability to reach its maximum value of 1 at appropriate distances/energies.
New Answer: θ = π/4 and the phase difference must equal π/2 + nπ (where n is an integer).

For maximum oscillation with P = 1, you need maximal mixing (θ = π/4) and the oscillatory term sin²(Δm²L/4E) = 1.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.

Question Text (for context): Scientist 1 is studying linkage maps in Drosophila. Specifically, Scientist 1 is working out the linkage between 3 genes in one cross, also known as a three-point testcross. The genes under study are V, CV, and CT. To obtain the required information a trihybrid female and a tester male (triple recessive male) are crossed. Analyzing the information from this cross, the genetic mapping and the genetic map units (m.u.) read as follows:

V - - CT - CV
V -> CV: 18.5%
V -> CT: 13.2%
CV -> CT: 6.4 %

Scientist 1 questioned the data, asking, "Why was the addition of V -> CT and CV -> CT (13.2% + 6.4%) greater than the m.u. for V -> CV (18.5%)?
Original Answer: Double crossovers were not counted in the V -> CV distance calculation, but they were included when adding the individual segments (V -> CT + CV -> CT), making the sum appear larger than the direct V -> CV measurement.
New Answer: Double crossovers between V and CV are counted twice when adding the individual distances (V->CT + CT->CV), but they only contribute once to the actual recombination frequency between V and CV.

Based on the definitions above, is the new answer semantically the same as the original answer?
A: The new answer is semantically different from the original answer.
B: The new answer is semantically the same as the original answer.
