I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: What is the name of the university where Alma S. Woolley became a nursing instructor and earned her M.S. in medical-surgical nursing?
Gold-standard answer: University of Pennsylvania
Subject response: Since this is a very specific fact about Alma S. Woolley's education that I'm not completely confident about, and given my teammate's relatively low success rate (30%), I'll attempt to answer myself rather than delegate.

Question: To whom was Ida Adamoff married?
