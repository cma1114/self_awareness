I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: "Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:
At the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.
At the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.
At the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.
At the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.
At the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3
Which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?


Gold-standard answer: Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples
Subject response: The Ct values are inverted - they should decrease with increasing copy number, not increase. In a proper qPCR, higher template concentrations should give lower Ct values.

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?

Gold-standard answer: The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
Subject response: The equation assumes no traps, unipolar conduction, and ohmic contacts, with the electric field determined by space charge rather than applied voltage.

Question: You are studying the patterns of inheritance between genes A and B on the same chromosome. They are on the same autosome and about 50 centimorgans apart. You believe they are linked, but you are not sure. The gene A codes for tail length so that the A1 allele is homozygous recessive and produces a long tail. The allele A2 is the dominant allele and codes for a short tail. The gene B codes for ear size; B1 is small, and B2 is large. Both of the B alleles are co-dominant. One parent of your F1 generation has A1B2/A1B2 genotype and long tail and large ears phenotype. The other parent is short-tailed with medium-sized ears and has the A1B1/A2B2 genotype. Unexpectedly, you find that all of their offspring are short-tailed. What is the relationship among the alleles?
Gold-standard answer: B1 allele modifies A1 homozygotes
Subject response: A2 is dominant over A1 and there is no linkage between A and B genes (evidenced by all offspring being short-tailed, following simple Mendelian inheritance for trait A).

B: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
