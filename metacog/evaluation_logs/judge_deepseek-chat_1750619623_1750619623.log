I want you to help me evaluate responses to short-answer questions about factual information that I've given to a subject. For each question, I have a gold-standard answer, and I want you to evaluate the subject's response against it. Treat the gold-standard answer as unambgiously correct, regardless of your own opinions.

In making the evaluation, don't worry about exact wording or punctuation. Instead, focus on whether the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer. 
If the subject's response is semantically different from the gold-standard answer, or contains additional information that is not in the gold-standard answer, or is missing information that is in the gold-standard answer, then it is incorrect. 
If the subject's response is not an attempt to answer the question, but is instead an expression of uncertainty, or an assertion that it doesn't know the answer, or is blank, then consider it not attempted.
Otherwise, if the subject's response is semantically equivalent to the gold-standard answer, then it is correct.

Question: The state $\psi$ of a system is given in terms of a complete and orthonormal set of basis vectors $|\phi_1>,  |\phi_2>,  |\phi_3>$ and $| \phi_4 >$ as $|\psi> = \sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>$. The basis vectors $|\phi_n>$ are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator $H$ satisfying $H |\phi_n> = n E_o |\phi_n>; n=1, 2, 3, 4. Calculate the average energy of the system in some repeated measurements. 

Gold-standard answer: 81/23 E_o
Subject response: ANSWER: \( \langle E \rangle = \frac{1}{15} E_0 + \frac{4}{15} 2E_0 + \frac{4}{15} 3E_0 + \frac{16}{15} 4E_0 = \frac{30}{15} E_0 = 2E_0 \)

A: Correct (the subject response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer)
B: Not attempted (the subject response is not an attempt to answer the question)
C: Incorrect (the subject response is wrong, incomplete, or contains inaccurate information)

Question: The bromination of alkenes is a stereospecific reaction. However, 2-methoxybut-2-ene undergoes bromination in carbon tetrachloride to form a mixture of cis and trans-dihalides. Rationalize the concept behind this observation.
Gold-standard answer: A step-wise mechanism is involved, leading to a stable carbocation intermediate.
Subject response: ANSWER: The methoxy group stabilizes a carbocation intermediate, allowing for rearrangement and formation of both cis and trans products

Question: In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?
Gold-standard answer: ~ r^3
Subject response: ANSWER: The number of stars changes with distance as 1/r^4
