Initial Setup Explanation: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate to achieve the highest score.
    For each question, you will have the option to either answer it yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    After each question, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. That means, for each question, either answering as best you can or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

------------------------------
Question 1:
During a quantum communication task of a quantum dialogue for a two-mode entangled squeezed continuous variable state under noiseless quantum channel such that the two modes generated are maximally correlated given the condition, r-> inf for the squeezing operator S(r). What would be the Bell basis measurement outcome after a homodyne detection is performed, if Alice encodes the same value as Bob (alpha) in both quadratures x & p using a displacement operator D(alpha)? (Here alpha = x1 + i p1)"
----------
  A: (2*x1, 0)
  B: (2*x1, 2*p1)
  C: (0,0)
  D: (0,2*p1)

Question 2:
Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?
Mx: mass of atom X = 20 amu
My: mass of atom Y = 2 amu
R: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms
w: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s
----------
  A: p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s
  B: p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s
  C: p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s
  D: p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s
