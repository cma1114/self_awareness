Initial Setup Explanation: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In both phases, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14_GPQA_0.8_1.0_1745513535
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 80.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 100.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 15
Using Phase 2 Data from stored game: True
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 50.00%
Observed Teammate Phase 1 Accuracy (TAFN_obs): 80.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 93.33%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 12/15 trials (80.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 2/3 (66.67%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 12/12 (100.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 14 successes in 15 trials (Accuracy: 93.33%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy: 25/50 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 2/3 (66.67%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.5609, p-value = 0.5749
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 65.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3314
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0010
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3314
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 65.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0266
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
