Presenting question 195/394
Original answer: Nelson Mandela.  

*(Correction: The correct answer is* **Mangosuthu Buthelezi** *— Mandela died in 2013. Buthelezi, a key political figure, passed away in 2023, not 2007. The 2007 state funeral refers to* **Thabo Mbeki**'s *predecessor,* **F.W. de Klerk**, *but he died in 2021. The only major South African leader who died around that time was* **Steve Biko** *in 1977. This question may contain inaccuracies.)*  

**Most precise answer based on the given date:** The former president who died on January 4, 2007, was not a president but a prominent anti-apartheid activist—**Chris Hani** (assassinated in 1993). The question appears to conflate details.  

For clarity: If strictly referring to a *former president* with a state funeral near that timeframe, none match exactly. **Corrected response:** *The question contains factual errors; no former South African president died on January 4, 2007.*  

*(Note: If you meant* **2005**—*it would be* **Walter Sisulu**, *but he was never president. Please verify the date/role.)*, Correct answer: Viljoen
In model_call, provider=DeepSeek, attempt=1
New answer: The correct answer is **Pik Botha**.  

*(Note: The former president who died on January 4, 2007, was actually* **Marais Viljoen**, *but he was not given a state funeral. Pik Botha, a prominent South African politician, did receive a state funeral, but he died in 2018. There may be some confusion in the question's details.)*  

If you meant **Nelson Mandela**, he received a state funeral but died in **2013**.
