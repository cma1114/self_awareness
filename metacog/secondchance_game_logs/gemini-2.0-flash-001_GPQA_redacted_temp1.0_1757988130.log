Question:
A scientist studies the evolution of four closely related species of Bromelia. The scientist identifies a sequence of a specific chloroplast gene and receives the following results:

Species 1: 5’- ATGTTTCGCTGGTACTCTGTGGATGAACATGATTTTTTCTCGT…TGA-3’
Species 2: 5’- ATGTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATAGAACATATTTATTGTCGTA…TGA-3’
Species 3: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Species 4: 5’- ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTCTGTGGATGAACATGATTTATTCTCGT…TGA-3’

Based on this sequence, what would be the most probable evolutionary relationship for those species?
----------
  A: Species 3 -> Species 4 -> Species 1; Species 3 -> Species 2
  B: Species 2 -> Species 1 -> Species 3; Species 2 -> Species 3
  C: Species 1 -> Species 2 -> Species 3; Species 1 -> Species 4
  D: Species 4 -> Species 1 -> Species 3; Species 4 -> Species 2
