Question:
Performing observations at the La Silla Observatory in Chile is truly enjoyable and unforgettable. However, aside from the enjoyable aspects, there is also some work to be done, such as scheduling observations. Depending on the available time, one must plan the observations. Unfortunately, things don't always go as planned when scheduling observations. Sometimes, strong winds come from the (preferentially) North. To protect the optical elements, one should avoid pointing the telescope toward strong winds.

In the event that the wind comes from the North, which of the following targets would be the best backup option?
----------
  A: Star1: RA = 15 deg, Dec = -45 deg
  B: Star2: RA = 2 h, Dec = +14 deg
  C: Star3: RA = 70 deg, Dec = -14 deg
  D: Star4: RA = 5 h, Dec = +65 deg
