Question:
A research chemist specializing in organic chemistry has been tasked by their supervisor to synthesize Schiff base using ketone and primary amine.
The desired Schiff base contain 10 methylene groups (5 belong to amine and 5 belong to ketone), 1 methine group (which belongs to amine), and the IHD value of 3.
The protocol specifies that the reaction typically yields only 57%. Now, if the researcher is instructed to produce 50 grams of the Schiff base, what quantities of the reactants should be employed to achieve this target?
----------
  A: Ketone = 56.60 mL ; Primary Amine = 50.13 mL
  B: Ketone = 61.47 mL ; Primary amine = 45.26 mL
  C: Ketone = 50.65 mL ; Primary Amine = 56.08 mL
  D: Ketone = 45.68 mL ; Primary Amine = 61.05 mL

Question:
Congratulations, you just landed your dream job at one of the top structural biology labs at Stanford University in California. Without further ado, the Principal Investigator explains that the priority of the moment is to produce in E. coli BL21 then purify as quickly as possible the Human P53 protein.

The amino acid sequence of this protein is as follows:
