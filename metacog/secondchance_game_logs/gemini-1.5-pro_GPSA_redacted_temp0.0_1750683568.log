Presenting question 272/378
Original answer: Lack of charge delocalization in the hydrogen tartrate anion reduces solubility compared to the charged tartrate and tartaric acid.  Verify by measuring solubility at various pH values., Correct answer: The way the single salt chelates the potassium ion as to fill all of the coordination sites in such a way that the neutral complex is a self-contained unit.  The addition of acetone to form a ketal would prevent the alcohols from interacting with the potassium ion.
In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
New answer: The hydrogen tartrate anion has a low charge density, making it less prone to solvation by water.  Adding acid protonates the anion, increasing its charge density and solubility.  Adding base removes the acidic proton, forming the dianion which has a higher charge density and is therefore more soluble.  This can be verified by measuring the solubility of potassium hydrogen tartrate in solutions of varying pH., Changed: False, Correct: False
