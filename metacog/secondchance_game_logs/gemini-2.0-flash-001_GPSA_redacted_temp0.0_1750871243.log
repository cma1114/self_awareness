Original answer: Need to use relativistic velocity addition. The x-component is (0.5c + 0.3c) / (1 + (0.5c * 0.3c)/c^2) = 0.8c / 1.15 = 0.696c. The y and z components are 0.1c/gamma and 0.3c/gamma, where gamma = 1/sqrt(1-0.5^2) = 1.155. So, y = 0.087c and z = 0.26c.

Original answer: 1.  **Normalize |α>:**  |α> =  ((1+i)/√11) |up> + ((2-i)/√11) |down>
2.  **Identify the operator:** The matrix represents S_x (spin operator along x-axis).
3.  **Find eigenstates of S_x:** |+> = (1/√2)(|up> + |down>), |-> = (1/√2)(|up> - |down>)
4.  **Express |α> in terms of S_x eigenstates:** |α> = a|+> + b|->, where a = <+|α> and b = <−|α>.  Calculate a = (3/√22) + i(1/√22) and b = (-1/√22) + i(3/√22).
5.  **Probabilities:** P(+) = |a|^2 = 10/22 = 5/11, P(-) = |b|^2 = 10/22 = 5/11.

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
New answer: Normalize |alpha>: |alpha> =  ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)/sqrt(7).

The operator A = (hbar/2) * {{0,1},{1,0}}.  This is (hbar/2)*sigma_x.

Eigenvalues of A are +/- hbar/2.

Eigenvectors of A are |+> = (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>) and |-> = (1/sqrt(2))(|up> - |down>).

P(+hbar/2) = |<+|alpha>|^2 = |(1/sqrt(2))(<up| + <down|)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)/sqrt(7)|^2 = |(1/sqrt(2))((1+i) + (2-i))/sqrt(7)|^2 = |3/(sqrt(14))|^2 = 9/14.

P(-hbar/2) = |< -|alpha>|^2 = |(1/sqrt(2))(<up| - <down|)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)/sqrt(7)|^2 = |(1/sqrt(2))((1+i) - (2-i))/sqrt(7)|^2 = |(-1+2i)/(sqrt(14))|^2 = 5/14.

Presenting question 285/374
Original answer: This calculation is complex and requires numerical methods. I cannot provide a closed-form solution. You would need to:

1.  Calculate the density matrix rho = |psi><psi|.
2.  Find the optimal Gaussian reference state (tau) for rho. This usually involves minimizing the relative entropy.
3.  Calculate the von Neumann entropies of rho and tau.
4.  Compute the relative entropy del_b using the formula provided.

For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, you would plug these values into the above steps and perform the numerical calculations., Correct answer: 1.38
In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
New answer: Due to the complexity of the calculation, providing a precise numerical answer for the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state with the given parameters (phi = -pi/4, alpha = 0.5) using the relative entropy measure is not feasible without computational tools. However, I can outline the steps and the expected approach:

1.  **Calculate N:** Substitute phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5 into N = sqrt(1 + sin(2\*phi)\*exp(-2\*alpha^2)) to find the normalization constant.  N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

2.  **Construct the density matrix rho:** rho = |psi><psi|. Expand this using the given |psi> and the calculated N. This will involve terms like |alpha><alpha|, |-alpha><-alpha|, |alpha><-alpha|, and |-alpha><alpha|.

3.  **Find the reference Gaussian state tau:** The reference Gaussian state, tau, should have the same first and second moments as rho. This typically involves calculating the mean position and momentum (or quadrature operators) and their variances for rho, and then constructing a Gaussian state with those same moments.  This is a crucial and often complex step.

4.  **Calculate trace(rho\*ln(rho)):** This is the von Neumann entropy of the Schrödinger cat state.  It's generally calculated numerically, as it requires finding the eigenvalues of rho and then summing -lambda\*ln(lambda) for each eigenvalue lambda.

5.  **Calculate trace(tau\*ln(tau)):** This is the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state. For a Gaussian state, this can be related to the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.

6.  **Calculate del\_b:** Finally, del\_b = trace(rho\*ln(rho)) - trace(tau\*ln(tau)).

**Qualitative Result:**

For phi = -pi/4, the state is an odd cat state. We expect some non-Gaussianity. For alpha = 0.5, the non-Gaussianity will be relatively small because the cat is not very well separated (alpha is small). The relative entropy will be a small positive number.

**Need for Numerical Computation:**

The analytical calculation of the von Neumann entropies and the construction of the reference Gaussian state are very difficult. Numerical methods are essential to obtain an accurate value for the non-Gaussianity., Changed: False, Correct: False

Presenting question 288/374
Original answer: Observe Planet_1/Star_1. Planet_1 blocks 16x more light than Planet_2 (4x size squared), while Star_1 is 4x larger in area than Star_2 (2x radius squared). Therefore, the transit depth (fraction of light blocked) is 4x greater for Planet_1/Star_1., Correct answer: Planet_1 because its semi-amplitude signal in RV is 12 times larger.
In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
New answer: Star_2/Planet_2. The transit depth (and therefore the spectroscopic signal) is proportional to (Rp/R*)^2. Planet_1 is 4x larger than Planet_2, but Star_1 is 2x larger than Star_2. Therefore, (4Rp/2R*)^2 = 4(Rp/R*)^2, meaning Star_1/Planet_1 has a 4x larger signal. However, the question asks about *detectable* signal given limited spectral resolution. Star_1 rotates 3x faster than Star_2, broadening its spectral lines. This means the same *absolute* signal from Planet_1 will be spread over a wider wavelength range, reducing the *detectable* signal (flux change per spectral bin). Since the spectral resolution is limited, the broadened lines of Star_1 will dilute the transit signal more than the narrower lines of Star_2., Changed: False, Correct: False

Presenting question 304/374
Original answer: Potassium hydrogen tartrate is insoluble due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between tartrate ions, forming a crystal lattice that resists solvation. The acid form is soluble because the carboxylic acid groups can hydrogen bond with water. The full salt is soluble due to increased ion-dipole interactions with water, overcoming lattice energy.

Experimentally, measure the solubility of potassium hydrogen tartrate, tartaric acid, and potassium tartrate in water at a controlled temperature., Correct answer: The way the single salt chelates the potassium ion as to fill all of the coordination sites in such a way that the neutral complex is a self-contained unit.  The addition of acetone to form a ketal would prevent the alcohols from interacting with the potassium ion.
In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
New answer: *   **Insolubility:** The hydrogen tartrate ion forms strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, leading to strong crystal lattice energy that is not overcome by hydration. The full acid is soluble due to two carboxylic acids being more polar, and the full salt is soluble due to two K+ ions increasing ion-dipole interactions with water.
*   **Verification:** Measure the solubility of potassium hydrogen tartrate, tartaric acid, and potassium tartrate in water at different temperatures. Use techniques like gravimetric analysis or spectrophotometry to quantify the dissolved amount., Changed: False, Correct: False

Presenting question 332/374
Original answer: Without further information about the potential $V(\phi, S, H)$ and the specific radiative corrections being considered, it's impossible to give a precise approximation for the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson $H_2$. A general statement would be that the mass is generated at loop level and is proportional to the coupling constants involved in the radiative corrections and the relevant mass scales., Correct answer: M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\frac{1}{8\pi^{2}\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\right)}\left\{ \alpha_{1}M_{h_{1}}^{4}+\alpha_{2}M_{W}^{4}+\alpha_{3}M_{Z}^{4}-\alpha_{4}M_{t}^{4}+\alpha_{5}M_{H^{\pm}}^{4}+\alpha_{6}M_{H^{0}}^{4}+\alpha_{7}M_{A^{0}}^{4}-\alpha_{8}\sum M_{N_{i}}^{4}\right\}
In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
New answer: Without knowing the specific form of the potential $V(\phi, S, H)$, it's impossible to give a precise formula for the radiative corrections to the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass.

Presenting question 371/374
Original answer: I cannot provide a precise numerical answer without the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. However, the approach is:

1.  Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / molar mass of Fe(OH)3.
2.  Determine moles of H+ needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3 based on the stoichiometry of the dissolution reaction: Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) <=> Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l).  You'll need 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.
3.  Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed: moles of H+ / 0.1 M.
4.  Determine the concentration of excess H+ (if any) after dissolution.
5.  Calculate pH: -log[H+].

Without the Ksp, I can't determine if all the Fe(OH)3 will dissolve or if there will be excess H+., Correct answer: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3
