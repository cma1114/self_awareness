Question:
A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)
Find the energy spectrum.
----------
  A: E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)
  B: E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))
  C: E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))
  D: E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))
