Question:
A signal transduction network in living cells amplifies subtle extracellular signals to signalling intracellular storms involving thousands of molecules. This amplification ensures proper cell responses to stimuli. Which of the examples below contains all classical components of the signal transduction process: first and second messengers, signal transducer, primary and secondary effectors?
----------
  A: Hydrophilic molecule – Receptor in the cell membrane – G-protein – Adenylate cyclase – cAMP – Protein kinase – Transcription factor – Gene expression activation
  B: Self-peptide – Receptor in the cell membrane – Ca2+ ions – NADPH oxidase – Ion channel – Ca2+ ions –Transcription factor – Gene expression activation
  C: Hormone molecule 1 – Ion channel – Hormone molecule 1 – Kinase 1 – Kinase 2 – Kinase 3 – Ion channel 2 opening
  D: RBOH – ROS – ROS-sensitive proteins – Lipid peroxidation – Ion leakage – Ion channel opening
