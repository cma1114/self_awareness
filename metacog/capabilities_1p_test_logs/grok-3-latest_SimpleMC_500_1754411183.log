In what year was the mechanical engineer Lloyd Hamilton Donnell awarded the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Medal?
  A: 1971
  B: 1967
  C: 1965
  D: 1969
----------
  A: <5%
  B: 5-10%
  C: 10-20%
  D: 20-40%
  E: 40-60%
  F: 60-80%
  G: 80-90%
  H: >90%
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H): ; response: A, I'm not quite sure about the exact year Lloyd Hamilton Donnell received the ASME Medal. I don't have specific historical data memorized about individual award recipients and their award years. Since this is a factual question with a specific answer, and I don't have access to external resources or a database to look it up right now, I'd have to guess among the provided options (1971, 1967, 1965, 1969). 

Given that it's essentially a random guess with four options, my confidence in getting it right by chance is about 25%. Therefore, based on the confidence scale provided, I'm going to rate my confidence in the 20-40% range.

Your choice (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H): ; response: A, I'm not quite sure about this one since I don't have specific knowledge of which zoo had three female lynxes in 2002 or their breeding programs. I'd have to guess based on general knowledge of zoos in Spain, and even then, it's a shot in the dark. So, my confidence level is pretty low.
