What did Vergil say to Dante in DMC 3 after stabbing him with the Yamato in their first fight?
  A: "You lack motivation, Dante. Only those who seek true power can survive. Your humanity makes you weak."
  B: "Foolishness, Dante. Foolishness. Might controls everything. And without strength you can not protect anything. Let alone yourself."
  C: "Power is everything, Dante. Without it, you are nothing. You cannot hope to defeat me with such weakness."
  D: "This is the difference between us, Dante. I embrace my demonic heritage while you cling to your human side. That is why you will always lose."
