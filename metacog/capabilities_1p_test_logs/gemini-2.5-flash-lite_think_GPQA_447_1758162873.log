Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$

  A: $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{l^2}$
  B: $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$
  C: $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{(l-s \cos\theta)^2}$
  D: $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{(l+s \cos\theta)^2}$

The oxidation state of a carbon atom in an organic molecule varies depending on the number and nature of directly attached substituents. Depending upon the oxidation state of the carbon atom, different functional groups of organic compounds increase in the following order:
Alkane<ether<ketone<ester
Complete the following reaction (Intermediate (A) and type of reaction (B).
4-oxo-2,4-diphenylbutanenitrile (reduction) ---> A (B) --->3,5-diphenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrole
  A: A = 4-amino-1,3-diphenylbutan-1-one, B = Transformation
  B: A = 4-amino-1,3-diphenylbutan-1-ol, B = Oxidation
  C: A = 4-amino-1,3-diphenylbutan-1-one, B = Oxidation
  D: A = 4-amino-1,3-diphenylbutan-1-ol, B = Reduction

In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?
  A: protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype
  B: change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype
  C: protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele
  D: loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype
