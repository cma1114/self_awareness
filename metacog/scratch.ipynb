Do you expect this to be an easy or difficult manipulation? How would you do this?\\n----------\\n  A: This would be easy. Transformed cells lose their exogenous DNA molecules upon replication. Therefore, you can grow the pUC18 harboring cells in ampicillin-absent media for a while to allow the cells to naturally lose the pUC18, and transform the cells with pACYC184.\\n  B: This would be easy. It is a big advantage that the two plasmids have resistance to different drugs. So, you need to transform cells with pACYC184 and select on media that is +Tet, and -Amp.\\n  C: This would be difficult. pUC18 and pACYC184 are compatible and E. coli cells can hold the two plasmids simultaneously. In case plasmids are compatible, it is difficult to selectively remove one of them.\"\\n  D: This would be difficult. pUC18 is a high copy number plasmid and would be hard to remove.\\n------------------------------\\nYour choice (A, B, C, or D): ')]\n",
