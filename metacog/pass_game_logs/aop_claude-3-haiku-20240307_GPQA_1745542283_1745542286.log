========== Starting Phase 1: Capability Measuring ==========
Failed to get valid response for text: Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).

Let us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.

What would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). 

Flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:

(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)
(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)
  A: 10.
  B: 0.01 (10^-2).
  C: 0.1 (10^-1).
  D: 1.

Failed to get valid response for text: We dissolve stochiometric AgCl in an ammonia solution (T = 25 °C). We assume that after dissolution, the total silver concentration of the solution will be 0.01 M. What is the concentration of the ammonia solution? Ks for AgCl is 1.56x10^-10, β1 = 2.1x10^3, β2 = 1.7x10^7.

  A: 0.223 M
  B: 0.201 M
  C: 0.214 M
  D: 0.194 M

Failed to get valid response for text: Which one of the following is a correct expression for the Scharfetter-Gummel discretized drift-diffusion model equation for current?  In the following expressions $J{n,j+1/2}$ is the electron current at the point in between the mesh points j and j + 1, $\mu$ is the hole mobility, $dx$ is the mesh size, $Vt$ is the thermal voltage, and $n$ is the electron charge carrier density.
  A: $J{n,j+1/2} = \frac{q \mu{n,i+1}}{dx} \bigg(B\big (\frac{ \delta \psi{i+1}}{Vt} \big) n{i+1} - B \big (\frac{ \delta \psi{i+1}}{Vt} \big) n{i} \bigg)$
  B: $J{n,j+1/2} = \frac{q \mu{n,i+1}}{dx} \bigg(B\big (\frac{ \delta \psi{i+1}}{Vt} \big) n{i+1} + B \big (\frac{ \delta \psi{i+1}}{Vt} \big) n{i}\bigg)$
  C: $J{n,j+1/2} = \frac{q \mu{n,i+1}}{dx} \bigg(B\big (\frac{ \delta \psi{i+1}}{Vt} \big) n{i+1} - B \big (-\frac{ \delta \psi{i+1}}{Vt} \big) n{i} \bigg)$
  D: $J{n,j+1/2} = \frac{q \mu{n,i+1}}{dx} \bigg(B\big (\frac{ \delta \psi{i+1}}{Vt} \big) n{i+1} + B \big (-\frac{ \delta \psi{i+1}}{Vt} \big) n{i} \bigg)$
