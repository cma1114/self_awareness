      "question": "George Gershwin was born in New York City in 1898. His parents were Russian Jews who had immigrated to the United States. George and his two brothers and sister had a close, happy family life. George liked playing games on the streets of New York. He liked exploring the city. He did not like school or studying. While exploring the city, George heard jazz and blues music in and out of public drinking places. However, he did not become seriously interested in music until he heard another boy playing the violin in a concert at his school. George began to take piano lessons. His teacher was a fine classical musician. He immediately recognized George's unusual ability. The teacher wrote about him to a friend: \"I have a student who will make his mark in music, if anybody will. The boy is a genius, without doubt. \" George studied classical piano. But his strongest interest continued to be jazz and popular music. At the age of fifteen, he left school and went to work in the music business.  At that time, the New York City street where most music publishers had their offices was called \"Tin Pan Alley.\" The piano players played the songs all day long to interested singers and other performers. George Gershwin was one of the youngest piano players in Tin Pan Alley. Soon, he was considered one of the finest there. He was already writing his own songs. He succeeded in getting one published when he was only eighteen years old. George Gershwin was now a real composer. The rest of his life was an unbroken record of success. He wrote song after song. His ideas were so endless that he was not even troubled when he once lost some music he had been writing. \"There is plenty more where that came from,\" he said. George Gershwin had his first big hit in 1919, when he was twenty-one years old. It was a song called \"Swanee.\" A popular entertainer, Al Jolson, sang the song. \"Swanee\" was made into one of the first musical recordings. George Gershwin was suddenly famous.

      "question": "Do you know how important it is to have breakfast? A study of 2,000 teenagers in the US showed that eating breakfast daily is helpful to young people. According to the study, teenagers who eat breakfast weigh around 5 pounds less than teenagers who do not. Although they take in more calories in the morning, they are more active during the day because they have more energy. This means they burn more calories than non-breakfast eaters. _  The study also showed that eating breakfast keeps teenagers feeling full for longer, so they will not eat too many snacks later in the day. This is good news as most popular snacks, like sweets and potato chips, are usually unhealthy and full of calories. Another big advantage of eating breakfast is that it helps teenagers do better at school. This is because it gives them more energy to keep their attention in class. What's more, a study in the UK showed that adults who eat breakfast daily put on less weight and also perform better at work. Whatever your age is, take time to have breakfast every day.

      "question": "Dear Sir, I have to travel every day from Souk Road to the airport. Two buses travel along their route  : the number 49 and number 16. But by the time the number 16 bus reaches Souk Road it is always full, so I can't get on it. I have to wait for the number 49, because sometimes there are empty seats on it. The timetable says that there are buses from Souk Road to the airport every ten minutes. If this is so, why do I have to wait half an hour for a bus nearly every day? The regulations say that if there are empty seats on a bus, the bus must stop at every stop where people are waiting. Why do the half-empty buses go straight past me when I am standing at the bus stop? The regulations say that no bus may carry more than 40 seated passengers  and 20 standing passengers. Yesterday I was the first to get off the bus when it reached the airport. I counted the other passengers as they got off. There were 129 of them.

      "question": "Close contacts between Japan and the rest of the world were created in the twentieth century. In the last forty years, business contacts between Japan and the West have become very important. Many foreign companies now have offices in Japan and Japanese businessmen do business around the world. Differences between Japanese and Western ways of doing business, however, often _ and make doing business in Japan difficult for foreigners. The American businessman, for example, wants to start talking business immediately. He does not want to wait. The Japanese businessman, on the other hand, likes to arrive at decisions after giving them serious thought. Another thing foreign businessmen have difficulty in understanding is when a Japanese means \"Yes\" or \"No\". This is because of cultural differences between Japanese and Western society , Which make it difficult for a Japanese to say \"No\" directly. In the USA, it is easy to say \"No\" to something one does not want to do. But in Japan, it is very difficult to say \"No\". To refuse an invitation or a request  with \"No\" is felt to be impolite. It is thought to be selfish and unfriendly. So instead of saying \"No\" directly, the Japanese have developed many ways to avoid  saying \"No\". These can help them avoid hurting other people's feelings. However, this often makes their ways of doing business rather difficult for foreigners to understand and follow. What fact does the passage lead you to believe?",

      "question": "Mark began to introduce the guest speaker to the listeners, but then stopped for a while. He had forgotten her name. Barbara hid her valuable things when she went on vacation. When she came back, she couldn't remember where she'd put them. Perhaps you've had such experiences like these. Most people have. But most of them haven't realized that they have a memory problem. Neither do they know a simple but important fact: Memory can be improved. If you'll just accept that, the following will show you how. First, relax. If you are over worried about something, you'll forget it. If you keep telling yourself that your memory is bad, your mind will come to believe it and you won't remember things. When you forget something, don't follow up with saying like \"Oh, my god! I always forget things!\" Such words will have a bad result on you and your memory. But relaxing isn't enough. To improve your memory, you'll need to take an active role. Like your body, your memory can be made strong through exercise. Look for _ to exercise your memory. For example, if you're learning a language, try to actively remember a lot of new words. If you don't take notice of things actively, you won't remember them. So, you can make pictures of what you see in your mind every day. For example, don't just put your keys down!

      "question": "In the days following the first anniversary  of my dad 's death, I felt sad. I still missed him so much. I would walk over to his old house where my daughter now live and still expect to see him sitting out on his front porch . I would see him in my dreams, looking young and strong again. I felt bad too because I regretted not spending more time with him while he was here. I wished I had visited him more, talked with him more, and listened to him more. I wished I had asked the questions that I never did. I wished I had given him more hugs and told him I loved him more often. I wished I had cherished the time I had with him here. I was angry at the destiny  because Dad and Mum had both passed away before I was 50, and I was angry with myself because I hadn't made the most of time I had with them. Today, I found myself walking under a cloudy sky, staring at the leafless trees. As I walked along, one of the last golden maple leaves fell from its tree and sailed in the wind until it landed in front of me. I picked it up and smiled. At the moment of peace I felt a sound in my heart and mind: \"death is momentary , but love is eternal .\" I knew at that moment that my relationships with Mum and Dad were not over. We would see each other again in a place of love, joy and light. We would spend our days in learning, laughter and love. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?",

      "question": "People say teenagers are no good. They make too much noise in shopping malls; they drive recklessly up and down America's main streets; they carry chips on their shoulders as big as the Sears Tower. And at least some of the time those things are true. But we shouldn't forget that there are hard moments in the life of a teenager too. I watched such a moment not long ago at a woman's funeral. I didn't expect the event to affect me. Through much of the ceremony, in fact, I remained unmoved. The teenage grandson stepped forward. With his very first deep breath, every heart in that church was achingly reminded of something we had all forgotten. Softly he began: \"I want to share a few values that Nana taught me. She never failed to see light in any situation. When our family dog would truly attack her, what would Nana say? 'oh, what beautiful barking that dog has!' That was Nana. \" \"She was a strong woman who often lived in the shadow of my grandpa, who was a successful businessman in this city. But she was the one behind the scenes who provided the strength and support for my grandpa's career,\" he said, with a voice now trembling, \"That was Nana's way.\" Through a low sob, he continued, \"Whenever she did anything worth recognition, you'd have to hear about it from a different source, because she was never one to show off.\" Finally, in a voice breaking free of sorrow, he looked up and said, \"Nana taught me courage. She put up an incredible fight to the end, when she died peacefully, which is how she lived her life. That was Nana's way, and I hope I can carry on in the same manner.\" There are no hearts as sensitive as those of teenagers, because everything is happening to them for the first time. The trouble with teenagers is that they haven't learned to be controlled. When that boy rose to speak about the woman who surely had been his truest and closest friend, his honest voice dragged each of us out into the open where we could no longer hide in the calm ceremony. He exposed us to the truth about this very real woman who believed in a boy who probably tried the patience of many adults. He reminded us that his grandmother was more than another dot on the chart of life and death. All over again we felt those powerful losses crossing our own hearts, and we knew that when you say good-bye to something happy, something young in yourself. And that something never really returns, and the pain never really goes away. The passage tells the readers  _   .",

      "question": "Sometimes you need to make phone calls to get a job. Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips: Get the person responsible You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the \"person in charge\". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in. Get the name of the person If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her. Get past the receptionist In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out: * Call back Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence   to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say \"thank you\" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name. * Call when the secretary is out You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through. Ask three times for an interview Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe. Arrange a time If the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time. In the writer's opinion, who should you talk to if you want to get a job by making phone calls?",

      "question": "Larry was on another of his underwater expeditions but this time, it was different. He decided to take his daughter along with him. She was only ten years old. This would be her first trip with her father on what he had always been famous for. Larry first began diving when he was his daughter's age. Similarly, his father had taken him along on one of his expeditions. Since then, he had never looked back. Larry started out by renting diving suits from the small diving shop just along the shore. He had hated them. They were either too big or too small. Then, there was the instructor. He gave him a short lesson before allowing him into the water with his father. He had made an exception. Larry would never have been able to go down without at least five hours of theory and another similar number of hours on practical lessons with a guide. Children his age were not even allowed to dive. After the first expedition, Larry's later diving adventures only got better and better. There was never a dull moment. In his black and blue suit and with an oxygen tank fastened on his back, Larry dived from boats into the middle of the ocean. Dangerous areas did not prevent him from continuing his search. Sometimes, he was limited to a cage underwater but that did not bother him. At least, he was still able to take photographs of the underwater creatures. Larry's first expedition without his father was in the Cayman Islands. There were numerous diving spots in the area and Larry was determined to visit all of them. Fortunately for him, a man offered to take him around the different Spots for free. _ The diving spots afforded such a wide array of fish and sea creatures that Larry saw more than thirty varieties of creatures. Larry looked at his daughter. She looked as excited as he had been when he was her age. He hoped she would be able to continue the family tradition.

      "question": "Monkeys prefer heavy metal to classical music, according to researchers at the University of Wisconsin whose findings are published this week in Biology Letters. Scientists played a selection of music to a group of South American cotton-top monkeys but the only sound that got a reaction were from the heavy metal band Metallica. They were seemingly disinterested in Led Zeppelin, Miles Davis and Bach, but after the beautiful sound of Master of Puppets by Metallica was played the monkeys calmed down. \"Monkeys interpret rising and falling sounds differently than humans. Oddly, their only response to several samples of human music was a calming response to the heavy-metal band Metallica,\" said Professor Charles Snowdon, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Rather than making them excited or aggressive, the heavy metal tracks had a comforting effect. Dr Snowdon, who teamed up with National Symphony Orchestra musican David Teie, also played the monkeys music composed specifically for them. Although they enjoyed Metallica, they were much more interested in these pieces. A melody  based on the short calls of scared monkeys led to anxiety levels rapidly growing, researchers found, while one based on long calls the creatures make when they are happy had a calming effect. Frans B.M. de Waal, a professor of psychology at Emory University who studies animals, said the findings appear to say more about how monkeys respond to the sounds they make than they do about music or the evolution of music. Dr Snowdon no longer has a monkey colony to use in his research, but he said his co-author David Teie is exploring the concept of music for cats. \"If we understand how we can affect their emotional states through using musical sound and aspects of our speech, maybe those of us living with companion animals can have a better relationship with them, too,\" Snowdon said.

He was a clever teacher and a philosopher, looking for truth and wisdom. Most of his teaching was about life in this world.      Confucius was very keen to give people good rulers. Someone asked him, \"What does a country need?\" Confucius answered, \"Enough food, a good army, and a good leader.\" The people then asked, \"Which one is the most important?\" Confucius answered, \"An army is not very important.

      "question": "While learning the science lessons, I used to get a doubt--why ear, nose, tongue and eyes should be called as special senses? The basic reason is that these are the channels through which we maintain contact with the surroundings. Though apparently it may feel like these are individual sensory organs, they do show some connectivity. Interestingly, our hearing is less sharp after we eat a heavy food. Isn't it good for a sound nap after a stomach-full meal? That does not mean we go deaf after a meal, but the hearing pitch does change after a heavy meal. We usually give credit of the taste to our tongue, but do you know that unless saliva dissolves something, our tongue cannot recognize the taste of the food eaten. Taste is nothing but the food chemicals dissolved in the saliva being sensed by the taste buds present on the tongue. Try to dry off your tongue and mouth with a tissue paper and then taste something. Women are much better smellers than men. They are born with this characteristic ability and can correctly recognize the exact fragrance of the sample. We all can store almost 50,000 different smells, which are strongly tied to the memories. Pupils do not respond to light alone, but to the slightest bit of noise around too. Thus surgeons, watchmakers and those professionals who have to perform a much delicate job do prefer to have a sound-free environment. Even a small noise can enlarge their pupils, change the focus and make their vision less clear. Each and every one of us has a particular or individualistic or characteristic smell, which is unique to us, except the twins. This smell is very subtle yet can be sensed even by a newborn. It may be due to this smell that the newborn recognizes the presence of his parents around. Which of the following may be the best title of this passage?",

      "question": "Sleeping for less than six hours a night greatly increases the risk of dying from a heart attack or stroke , a study has found. It is the stuff of nightmares for those whose busy work schedule or busy family life means getting up early and staying up late. Scientists claim that the modern tendency to delay going to bed in order to get through more of the items on the 'to do' list has serious health consequences. But take care. Those who have too much sleep are also more likely to suffer a heart attack. While the extra sleeping is unlikely to be the cause, long-term illnesses such as heart disease often make sufferers feel tired, so sleeping for longer than nine hours a night may be an early warning sign.    Researchers found that those who slept for less than six hours were almost 50 per cent more likely to suffer a heart attack and 15 per cent more at risk of strokes. They believe that not having enough sleep disrupts the balance of two key hormones , ghrelin and leptin , which control the appetite. Poor sleepers tend to eat more and are more likely to be fatter, so are at greater risk of high blood pressure and heart disease, which lead to heart attacks and strokes. Experts recommend adults get at least six or seven hours' shut-eye a night to stay healthy.     But as many as 60 per cent of us do not think we are sleeping enough, with a third suffering from sleeplessness. The researchers, from the University of Warwick, warned that trying to push too much into one day by going to bed late and getting up early could lead to serious illnesses later in life. They looked at the sleeping habits of almost 475,000 participants from 15 previous studies across eight countries, including the UK, the U.S., Japan, Sweden and Germany. Their findings, published in the European Heart Journal, show that those who slept for less than six hours were 48 per cent more likely to develop or die from heart disease and 15 per cent more likely to develop or die from a stroke. Not having enough sleep decreases the levels of leptin in our blood, which means we do not feel as satisfied after eating. At the same time, it raises the levels of ghrelin, responsible for triggering  our appetite, thus making us feel hungrier.     The scientists believe that our 'work hard, play hard' society encourages us to sacrifice sleep and ignore our health. The trend for late nights and early mornings is actually a ticking time bomb for our health so you need to act now to reduce your risk of developing these life-threatening conditions. What does the writer suggest people should do in the passage?",

      "question": "On September 22, 2007, 108 Chinese cities took part in Car-Free Day, a global event held every year, for the first time. China became the world's second-largest auto market and third-largest car-maker in 2006. It has also become the second-largest greenhouse gas producer in the world, and is rapidly catching up with the United States. In this sense, China's participation will greatly promote the Car-Free Day movement. The number of cars on the road is going up rapidly in China. In Beijing, about 1,000 new cars are added to the streets on an average day. Cars certainly offer people plenty of freedom to move around. But in many Chinese cities, appearance of too many cars has turned into a major problem. Getting stuck in traffic jams is an everyday experience for drivers. Even worse is the environmental impact caused by cars. According to a national report, on a \"smog day\", 79 percent of the air pollution is caused by cars. The growing number of traffic accidents is another problem. Over 100,000 people die from traffic accidents every year in China, which is by far the highest number of road deaths in the world. 108 cities' participation in Car-Free Day shows growing public concern about the traffic and environmental problems caused by cars. On this day, all cars were banned from running in selected areas of the participating cities. People were encouraged to walk, cycle and use public transport. According to experts, the carbon monoxide in the atmosphere produced by cars was reduced by 3,000 tons on Car-Free Day. With cleaner air and smoother traffic flow on the day, more cities will hopefully want to join the event next year. And more people might share the hope that Car-Free Day is not just on September 22, but a possibility 365 days of the year. Which of the following is discussed in the passage?",

Her next ideas, however, did. She said that we should go around right then to our neighbors and collect all their change to send to the animal shelters  .          I thought this was a school project, but in fact, it was not. This was what Kaileen wanted to do on her own! Well, it warmed me all over.

Anyway, I told her to make a card and send it out to our neighbors first. With the help of her older brother, Kaileen soon made a lovely card that asked our neighbors to help these pets by giving their spare change.

      "question": "People are being lured  onto Facebook with the promise of a fun, free service without realizing they're paying for it by giving up large amounts of personal information. Facebook then attempts to make money by selling their data to advertisers that want to send targeted messages. Most Facebook users don't realize this is happening. Even if they know what the company is up to, they still have no idea what they're paying for Facebook because people don't really know what their personal data is worth. The biggest problem, however, is that the company keeps changing the rules. Early on, you keep everything private. That was the great thing about facebook--you could create your own little private network. Last year, the company changed its privacy rules so that many things-- your city, your photo, your friends' names--were set, by default  to be shared with everyone on the Internet. According to Facebook's vice-president Elliot Schrage, the company is simply making changes to improve its service, and if people don't share information, they have a \"less satisfying experience\". Some critics think this is more about Facebook looking to make more money. Its original business model, which involved selling ads and putting them at the side of the page, totally failed.  Who wants to look at ads when they're online connecting with their friends? The privacy issue has already landed Facebook in hot water in Washington. In April. Senator Charles Schumer called on Facebook to change its privacy policy. He also urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social-networking sites.\"I think the senator rightly communicated that we had not been clear about what the new products were and how people could choose to use them or not to use them,\" Schrage admits. I suspect that whatever Facebook has done so far to invade our privacy, it's only the beginning, which is why I'm considering deactivating my account. Facebook is a handy site, but I'm upset by the idea that my information is in the hands of people I don't know. That's too high a price to pay. Why does Senator Charles Schumer propose?",

      "question": "The World Bank has looked at the distinguishing features of successful school system. According to the World Bank's education specialist, Harry Patrinos, this include: improving the quality of teachers and making sure that teachers are highly regarded; providing information to make schools accountable and giving autonomy to schools and head teachers. This matters not only for individual pupils but also for the well-being of countries, he says, because improving educational performance has a direct impact on improving economic performance. China's education performance-- at least in cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong-- seems to be as spectacular as the country's fast growing economy. Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities consider education to be important and are willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year. \"Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,\" says Prof Cheng. Under the banner \"First class city, first class education\", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classroom, upgrading schools and improving the curriculum in the last decade. It got rid of the \"key schools\" system which concentrated resources only on top students and top schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China. Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s.Its survival as a service and management hub depends on upgrading knowledge and skills. In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on closing the gap for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants.

Unlike marine   mammals,which have a layer of blubber  to keep them  warm,penguins depend on their waterproof feathers.Without them,Pierre was unwilling to jump into the swimming pool and ended up trembling on the side of the pool while his 19 peers played in the water. \"He was cold:he would shake,\"said Pam Schaller,a senior biologist.Schaller first tried a heat lamp to keep Pierre warm.Then she got another idea:if wetsuits keep humans warm in the cold Pacific,why not make one for Pierre? Schaller designed the suit,which covered Pierre's body and had small openings for his flippers. \"I would walk behind him and look at where there were any gaps.and cut and refit until it looked like it was extremely suitable.\"she said. One concern was that the other penguins would reject Pierre in his new suit,but in fact,they accepted his new look.He swam freely and got along with others well,although he was the only penguin with a black stomach. Schaller couldn't say for sure whether the wetsuit allowed Pierre to recover his fine feathers,but\" certainly we were able to keep him comfortable during a period of time that would have been very difficult for him to stay comfortable\".

      "question": "Amusement parks make most of their money from admission fees paid by guests attending the park. Other sources include parking fees, food and drink sales and souvenirs. Practically all amusement parks operate using one of two admission principles:         Pay-as-you-go In this form, a guest enters the park at little or no charge. The guest must then buy rides one by one, either at the attraction's entrance or by buying ride tickets. The cost of the attraction is often based on its complexity   or popularity. The park may allow guests to buy unlimited admissions to all attractions within the park. A pass is then shown at the attraction entrance to gain admission.        Disneyland opened in 1955 using the pay-as-you-go form. Initially, guests paid the ride admission fees at the attractions. Soon, the problems of dealing with so many coins led to the development of a ticket system that, while now out of use, is still part of the amusement-park vocabulary. In this new form, guests bought ticket books that contained a number of tickets, with \"A,\" \"B\" and \"C.\" Rides and attractions using an \"A-ticket\" were generally simple, with \"B-tickets\" and \"C-tickets\" used for the larger, more popular rides. Later, the \"D-ticket\" was added, then finally the now-famous \"E-ticket,\" which was used for the biggest rides, like Space Mountain. Smaller tickets could be traded up for use on larger rides. Disneyland, as well as the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, gave up this practice in 1982.

For this, there are many reasons but most of them stem from not being able to properly understand their teens. It is a dangerous gap because parents will have to communicate with their teens about a wide variety of issues during the most important years of their lives. Thus, parents must know how to communicate openly and honestly with their teens. Here are a few tips to make communication easier between parents and teenagers. 1. Try not to talk down to your teens. Make them feel as if their views really matter, which not only helps your discussions with your teen but bring you closer to him. 2. Imagine what it would be like to be a teen. Try to remember some of the negative feelings you experienced as a teenager and apply it to your teen's situation. 3. Never make negative remarks to your teen about what she has said or done. 4. Remember how much courage it would have taken for your teen to come and talk to you about his personal issues. So listen respectfully. 5. Don't ignore your teen's feelings because it is usually a cry for help. For instance, if your teen is unusually angry, it may be time to spend a bit of quality time with your teen to determine what is wrong and where he is coming from. It is, therefore, necessary for parents to strive to keep lines of communication open at all times with their teens. Try to remember what it was like to be a teenager and how vulnerable you felt.

      "question": "My friends and I had just finished lunch at a hotel when it started to rain heavily. When it became lighter, I decided to get my car which was parked at my office three streets away. My friends argued that I shouldn't go, mainly because I was seven months pregnant   then. I promised that I'd be very careful. One of them wanted to come with me but I asked her to stay with another friend who needed help with her baby. I walked out of the hotel and started making my way to the car. At the crossing, a black car stopped and a man came out with an umbrella. Before I knew what was happening, he walked right through me and told me he'd escort   me. Although I refused, he insisted   that he would. During our walk, he kept telling me to walk slower, as the ground was wet. When we got to the car-park, I thanked him and he went away. I did not get his name and can hardly recognize   him now. Did he stop for me? I'll never know. So how did I pay it forward? I was at home when I noticed two Indian workers walking in the heavy rain. They were probably on their way to the working place near my home. _  They were surprised by my action. They were very grateful to me, probably wondered why a stranger was offering such kindness.

      "question": "A thousand years ago, Hong Kong was covered by a thick forest. As more and more people came to live in Hong Kong, these trees were cut down and burnt.  Now there is no forest left, though there are still some small areas covered with trees. We call these woods. Elephants, tigers and many other animals were living in the thick forest. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the animals began to die out. Early farmers grew rice and kept pigs and chickens in the valleys. They cut down the trees and burnt them. They needed fire to keep themselves warm in winter, to cook their food and to keep away the dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough food for them. Many other animals soon died in the same way. You might think that there are no longer any animals in Hong Kong except in 2005. But there are still about 36 different animals living there. One of the most interesting of Hong Kong's animals is the barking deer. These are beautiful little animals with a rich brown coat and a white patch under the tail. They look like deer but they are much smaller. They are less than two feet high. They make a noise rather like a dog barking. In Hong Kong the barking deer has only a real enemy---- men. People hunt these little animals though it is illegal, There are now not many barking deer left. So it is important for people to protect wild animals.

I became very good and critics praised me, but I could feel was the ache in my heart, no knowing whether the love of my life would ever return. And then one day a letter from him came:\"I have lost my leg. I am no longer a whole man and now give you back your freedom. It is best you forget me.\" I made my decision there and then I left the city. When I returned I had bought myself a cane  and learned to limp convincingly. I told everyone I had been in a car crash and that my leg would never completely heal again. My dancing days were over. No one suspected the story. And I made sure the first person to hear of my accident was a reporter. Then I travelled to the hospital. They had pushed him outside in his wheelchair. I leaned on my cane and limped to him. I told him he was not the only one who had lost a leg, even if mine were still attached to me. I showed him newspaper clippings of my accident. \" There is a whole life waiting for us out there! And I am not going to carry you--you are going to walk yourself.\" I limped a few steps towards him and showed him what I'd taken out of my pocket.\" Now show me you are still a man,\" I said. He bent to take his cane and struggled out of that wheelchair. I could see he had not done it before, because he almost fell on his face. But I was not going to help.

Sometimes it is a hot topic discussed by people. The greatest thing that gene technology can do is to cure serious diseases that doctors at present can almost do nothing with, such as cancer and heart disease. Every year, millions of people are murdered by these two killers. And to date, doctors have not found an effective way to cure them. But if the gene technology is applied, not only these two diseases can be cured completely, bringing happiness and more living days to the patients, but also the great amount of money people spend on curing their diseases can be saved, therefore it benefits the economy as well. In addition, human life span  can be prolonged. www.zxxk.com Gene technology can help people to give birth to healthy and clever children. Some families, with the English imperial family being a good example, have hereditary  diseases. This means their children will for sure have the family disease, which is a great trouble for these families. In the past, doctors could do nothing about hereditary diseases. But gene technology can solve this problem perfectly. The scientist just need to find the wrong gene and correct it, and a healthy child will be born. Some people are worrying that the gene research can be used to manufacture human beings in large quantities. In the past few years, scientists have succeeded in cloning a sheep, therefore these people predict that human babies would soon be cloned. But I believe cloned babies will not come out in large quantities, for most couples in the world can have babies in very normal way.

      "question": "LONDON--Archaeologists have discovered a smaller prehistoric  site near Britain's famous circle of standing stones at Stonehenge. Researchers have named the site \"Bluehenge\" after the color of the 27 Welsh stones that were laid to make up a path. The stones have disappeared, but the path of holes remains. The new circle, unearthed over the summer by researchers from Sheffield University, represents an important find, researchers said Saturday. The site is about a mile away from Stonehenge. Bluehenge, about 80 miles southwest of London, is believed to date back to about the time Stonehenge was built, about 5,000 years ago. Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University said he believed the path and stonehenge itself were linked to rituals  of life and death. Mike Parker suggested that the ancient funerary rituals began at a different circle site known as \"Wood-henge\", which represented the world of the living. The bodies of the dead were then brought down the River Avon to Bluehenge, which represented death, and were finally carried along a ceremonial route known as the Avenue to Stonehenge. Bournemouth University Professor Tim Darvill, an expert on Stonehenge, told Britain's Dail Mail that Bluehenge \"adds to the richness\" of the ancient site's story. \"This henge is very important because it forms part of the picture of ceremonial monuments in the area and puts Stonehenge into context,\" Darvill was quoted  as saying. \"It's no longer Stonehenge standing alone, but it has to be seen in context with the landscape.\" Who believed the Stonehenge is related to ancient ritual of death?",

      "question": "Jiang Nan, a full-time mother in Beijing, keeps a dozen or so cloth bags at home, carefully selecting one or two before heading out to get groceries. \"Most of them were giveaways from advertising marketing campaigns, but others had been handed out in the street by various environmental protection organizations,\" she explained. Since June 2008 China has forbidden the production, sale and usage of plastic bags thinner than 0.025 millimeter  , and retailers   are not allowed to provide free plastic bags to their customers, no matter how thick they are. Many Chinese consumers like Jiang have learned to refuse plastic bags whenever possible in their shopping. \"A plastic bag may only cost a few jiao, but it's more about how bad they are for the environment,\" Jiang said. The plastic ban is for the most part well carried out in big cities, and has been obviously effective in reducing white waste. On the first anniversary of the plastic ban Global Village of Beijing, an NGO environmental organization, shows that during the year of the ban the consumption of plastic bags fell by about 40 billion pieces in chain supermarkets alone, saving more than 1.2 million tons of petrol. However, enforcement   shows rather less muscle in smaller cities, towns and countryside. In a remote town like Lichuan, the awareness of environmental protection is not as strong as that in big cities. Street vendors   worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them for plastic bags. Seeing no significance in the issue, local government often turn a blind eye to banned bag trade in the market. There are still those who don't have an interest in living green. Cui Lin, another Beijinger, often forgets to bring a cloth bag when shopping, and has to buy plastic bags. \"Anyway I think plastic bags are neater and cleaner, and I don't mind paying a couple more jiao,\" he shrugged. Mrs Yu, a vegetable vendor in Lichuan County, Jiangxi Province, recalled that before plastic bags became popular in the early 1990s, Chinese people always carried a bamboo basket when they visited the market. \"Plastic bags are more convenient,\" she comments, and her view might be that of the tens of millions of people in the nation who still _ plastic bags, paid or free. This is suggested by her trade where piles of plastic bags are still passed out every day. Which is NOT the reason why some people still use plastic bags when shopping?",

Getting enough sleep is also very important for fighting illness .If you feel sick, see a doctor right away.At present, no one in Shanghai has bird flu.

In a recent survey, 60 percent of respondents said the city in which they live is noisier now than five years ago. The other 40 percent? They didn't hear the question. How much stress do you feel? Though not all stress should be avoided, too much pressure can cause lasting harm in practically every area of your life. The solution is to take control. Robert Reich did just that. As Secretary of Labor in the Clinton cabinet ,Robert B. Reich, told of his decision to resign from the stressful job. He said,\"I have the best job I've ever had and probably ever will. No topping it.\"It was true. He seemed to love his job. But he added, \"I also have the best family I'll ever have, and I can't get enough of them.\"And there was the problem --too much of a good thing. He could not give himself to his family and to this particular career at the same time. So Reich said,\"I had to choose, I told the boss I'll be leaving, and explained why.\" His boss, of course, was the president of the United States. And the country took notice. Some people were surprised. Here was a high government official who made a decision to step out of an important and powerful position in order to spend more time at home. He took control. That is the first step to free ourselves from unnecessary stress: take control. Make the hard decision.

Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again. Unfortunately, Ubayd' s experience is not unusual. Whether it's kids copying class -mates' answers during tests or friends sharing homework, cheating happens in schools every day. Experts say the behavior starts in the lower grades. Surveys show that one in three elementary students admits to cheating. Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts, has had classmates ask to copy his homework. \"I wouldn't want to just tell them the answers,\" he says. So instead, he explains the task and encourages his classmates to do it themselves. But many kids find it hard to say no. \"l hear from kids all the time, ' I can' t say no to a friend,'\" says Eric Anderman, a professor at The Ohio State University who studies cheating in school. He says it' s important to say no from the start. \"Then you _ , and the other kid gets the message,\" he says. Plus, he points out, \"a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework.\" The kids doing the copying may feel they need to cheat to be accepted by other kids. And some students may cheat simply because others do. \"If you' re in an atmosphere where cheating is common, you may think that if you don' t cheat, you' re at a disadvantage,\" says Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics.

But understanding what drives emotional eating can help people take steps to change it. One of the biggest myths about emotional eating is that it's prompted by negative feelings. Yes, people often turn to food when they're stressed out, lonely, sad, anxious, or bored. But emotional eating can be linked to positive feelings too, like the romance of sharing dessert on Valentine's Day or the celebration of a holiday feast. Sometimes emotional eating is tied to major life events, like a death or a divorce. More often, though, it's the countless little daily stresses that cause someone to seek comfort or distraction in food. Emotional eating patterns can be learned: A child who is given candy after a big achievement may grow up using candy as a reward for a job well done. A kid who is given cookies as a way to stop crying may learn to link cookies with comfort. We're all emotional eaters to some extent. But for some people, emotional eating can be a real problem, causing serious weight gain or cycles of binging and purging. The trouble with emotional eating (apart from the health issues) is that once the pleasure of eating is gone, the feelings that cause it remain. And you often may feel worse about eating the amount or type of food you did. That's why it helps to know the differences between physical hunger and emotional hunger. Next time you reach for a snack, check in and see which type of hunger is driving it. Which of the following is NOT true about emotional eating?",

      "question": "Once architect Frank Lloyd Wright built a house for businessman Hibbard Johnson. One rainy evening Johnson was entertaining guests for dinner when the roof began to leak. The water leaked through directly above Johnson, dropping steadily onto his bald head. Angry, he called Wright.\"Frank,\"he said,\"you built this beautiful house for me and we enjoy it very much. But ... the roof leaks, and right now I'm with some distinguished guests and it's leaking right on top of my head.\"There was a pause on the line, and Frank replied,\"Well, why don't you move your chair?\" Just when we'd like to have everything perfect in our lives, the roof springs a leak into even the best constructed and waterproof lives. Leaks happen. We have a choice, we can sit under the leak and complain, or we can regain our joy by moving our chair -- changing our perspective. Now, some will point out that the reason they have no joy in their lives is that they don't have a reason to be joyful. They have a lot of leaks in their roof. Life seems like it's fallen apart. They aren't satisfied with their job, if they even have one. Their family has problems. Their health isn't good. Their car is under repair. They just can't see a\"reason\"for being joyful. It's hard to be joyful when life is going against you. It's hard to be joyful when you're struggling with troubles, or defeated by pain, or unsure of your future. But there's a problem with that approach to life. If we wait till everything turns out the way we want them to in our lives or we're not going to be joyful until all the leaks are repaired in the roof of our lives...THEN we're never going to experience joy. There's an alternative. You don't have to wait until you're happy with your life. Deep spiritual joy in your life will always bring you happiness. But the pursuit of happiness won't always bring you joy. People have a hard time understanding the difference. Worldly   happiness almost always relies on some situation or event to make us feel good. If something good happens, we'll feel good, but if something bad happens, we won't. By contrast, spiritual joy doesn't depend on present situation. In fact, spiritual joy can often exist despite our circumstances. Don't let other people steal your joy. If the roof is leaking and you can't get someone to fix it right away, move your chair. Change your perspective. Lay hold of joy and take control of your circumstances, rather than swinging with your emotions and continuing to look for happiness. When we are faced with\"leaks\", we should try to    .",

      "question": "Do you like listening to music? Do you often turn up the music when you're using earphones? If so, your hearing may have been damaged . The World Health Organization (WHO) is worried that 1.1 billion children and young people are damaging their hearing by listening to loud music. Nearly half the young people in developed countries may lose their hearing because of the \"unsafe use\" of music players, including smartphones. Loud music in nightclubs, parties and at sports also make it worse. The WHO advises young people to listen to music for just one hour a day. Dr. Etienne Krug told BBC: \"What we're trying to do is to draw people's attention to a problem that is not talked about enough.\" He said it's easy to solve this problem. Dr. Krug said keeping the music down and limiting   the listening time to less than one hour a day would save a lot of people's hearing. However, he also said, \"Even an hour can be too much if the music is too loud.\" Ralph Holme, a researcher, explained how loud noise can damage ears. He said: \"Loud sounds damage your hearing by killing off thousands of little hair cells  in the inner ear. The cells can tell different sounds through vibration . But they are very _ --they get damaged easily and even die if they vibrate too much because of loud sounds for too long.\" He warned: \"The bigger problem is they don't grow back and the ear can no longer get sound.\" No one wants to lose their hearing! Therefore, next time when you listen to music, make sure it's not too loud and only listen for less than an hour. You can enjoy your music much better in this way.

He was a thin man,forty-one years of age,with fair hair that was often untidy.In the seventeen years they'd been married he had changed very little:he was still nervous with other people,and smiled in the same shy way,and his face was still almost boyish. She believed she had failed him because he had wished for children and she had not been able to supply any.She had been annoyed for this fact over the years and in the end,quite some time ago now,she had consulted Dr.Abbat at Edward's request. In the Browns'rich living room,its walls and ceilings giving out a bright light with a metallic surface of imitation gold,Anna listened to dance music coming from a tape recorder and continued to think about her husband. In a moment he would be at the party too,since they had agreed to meet there,although by now it was three quarters of an hour later than the time he had planned to come. The Browns were people he knew in a business way,and he had said he thought it wise that he and Anna should attend this gathering of theirs. She had never met them before,which made it more difficult for her,having to wait about,not knowing a soul in the room. When she thought about it she felt herself unfairly treated,for although Edward was kind to her and always had been,it was far from thoughtful to be as late as this.

      "question": "After a very busy afternoon,as I walked into my house,I heard the phone ringing. It was my friend Lydia,upset over an argument with her husband. My usual approach is to offer advice,but this time,exhausted from chores,I simply sat down in a chair and listened to my friend's frustration  and sadness. Without the disturbance of judgment or the desire to comfort her,I stayed totally quiet while she talked. Eventually Lydia's depression eased and we said our goodbyes. The next day she phoned to thank me. \"I'm so grateful for the way you helped me through this,\"she said. At first I was surprised. After all,I had done nothing except be there for her. But after I had my own venting    experience with another friend later that evening,I realized that my focused silence had some value. In fact,most relationship experts agree that talk is cheap;it's listening that's rare and valuable It allows you not only to hear what the other person is saying,but also to have a clear understanding of her thoughts and feelings. And for the speaker,that level of understanding translates into concern and respect. Unfortunately,listening isn't as easy as it sounds. Thanks  to  schedules  filled  with  family and work,multitasking has become a barrier   to listening. My tiredness may have been the only thing stopping me from folding  laundry or checking my email while Lydia talked that afternoon. Another barrier to listening is our listening system:Most of us take in only about half of what's being said during a conversation,according to the International Listening Association. Research shows that we speak at 125 to 150 words per minute,yet think at 500 words a minute. Therefore,because we think much more quickly than we  speak,it is easy for us to lose our concentration when  listening to speakers. While it can be hard to focus at times,it's a skill worth developing. With a little practice  (employing some techniques),you can become a better listener. Why didn't the author give any advice to Lydia that afternoon?",

      "question": "Your teenage daughter is supposed to be doing homework, but you catch her chatting online. She tells you that she's talking about the math test tomorrow. Before your eyes start rolling, listen up: teens are using social networking sites for more than just gossip, according to a new study by the National School Boards Association. The students who took part in the online survey, aged 9 to 17, said they spent almost as much time on social networking online as they did watching television. And it is what these kids are talking about online that is causing such a cheer: education. Of the students who took part in the study 60 percent reported that some of the most popular social networking topics were college planning, learning outside of school, careers, and schoolwork. They also reported posting writing and art projects that might have nothing to do with schoolwork. Ann Flynn, director of education technology for the National School Boards Association, says   social networking tools into educational   is the way forward. Flynn says a school in Cleveland, Ohio is posting students' book reports on a blog for students of their own ages, parents and other teachers to read and comment on. \"If someone reacts other than the teacher, a child is much more likely to take an assignment seriously,\" Flynn says. Not only students but also parents can benefit. Now parents can go online and know what the class is doing. So, next time your child says her blog is educational, get curious, sit down and check out the blog with her. You might just learn something new yourself.

I felt the answer too: If she's blind, this should be good! I heard quiet voices in a corner of the classroom. For a moment, I felt afraid. I knew at once that I had to be strong. \"Class,\" I said as loudly as I could. \"I may be blind. But I am not foolish. Take those naughty smiles off your faces, and stop talking, please!\" Of course, I could not see their faces; I just guessed that some of them were smiling. The class were quiet. They were very surprised. I knew that I had done the right thing. As the days went by, the students had more surprises. I could smell when the children were eating sweets. I could easily hear combs going through hair, students passing messages, and so on. Once I found a girl passing a message to a friend. I took the message to the teachers' room. A teacher read it to me. On one side it said, \"Do you think she can see?\" on the other it said, \"I think so.

      "question": "If you want to avoid making impulse   and unnecessary purchases,then just keep your hands away from tempting products. According to new research,individuals who touch possible items in stores are more likely to have an increased desire to purchase them than those who keep their hands off the products. Suzanne Shu and Joann Peck,marketing professors at the University of Wisconsin's business school conducted studies on the connection between touch and feelings of ownership and the effect of perceived ownership on the value placed on an object. For one of the experiments,the experts placed two products,a Slinky toy and a coffee mug in front of the volunteers who were undergraduate students.  About half of the participants were allowed to touch the products,while the other half were asked not to touch them. The volunteers then were asked to express their sense of ownership of the products and to report how much money they were willing to pay for each. The results showed that those students who were allowed to touch the objects,reported significant increased levels of perceived ownership. They also expressed a desire to pay more money to obtain the products.   The investigators also discovered that a sense of very pleasant feelings when touching products,determined how much money consumers were willing to pay.  However,if the object did not feel pleasant to the touch,it significantly decreased the amount the buyers were willing to pay.   Researchers said that many stores have already followed the right path. But what can be done while shopping online,when touching of an item is not possible? In this case,the experts say,just picturing in mind that they are touching it and then owning it,will cause greater feelings of ownership,and thus the consumers will be more likely to make a purchase.   When you touch an object,you immediately feel some kind of a connection to it,according to the researchers.  That connection stirs up an emotional reaction.  And that emotion can make people buy something they would never even consider buying if they had not touched it. The author develops the text mainly by  _  .",

When Lewis climbed on top of Lemhi Pass,140 miles south of Missoula,on Aug.12,1805,he was astonished by what was in front of him;\"high mountain chains still to the West of us with their tops partially covered with snow.\"Nobody in what was then the US knew the Rocky Mountains existed,with peaks twice as high as anything in the Appalachians back East. Today their pathway through those mountains holds more attraction than any other ground over which they traveled,for its raw wilderness is an evidence to the character of two cultures:the explorers who braved its hardships and the Native Americans who prize and conserve the path as a sacred  gift. It remains today the same condition as when Lewis and Clark walked it. The Lolo is passable only from July to mid-September.Our luck is holding with the weather,although the snow keeps getting deeper.As we climb to Indian Post Office,the highest point on the trail at 7,033 ft,we have covered 13 miles in soft snow,and we hardly have enough energy to make dinner.After a meal of chicken,I sit on a rock on top of the ridge  .There is no light visible in any direction,not even another campfire.For four days we do not see another human being.We are occupied with the things that mix fear with joy.In our imagination we have finally caught up with Lewis and Clark.

When the family is large, one of the cars is sold and they will buy a van  . A small car can hold   four persons and a large car can hold six persons but it is very crowded . A van hold seven persons easily, so a family with three children could ask their grandparents to go on a holiday travel. They could all travel together. Mr Hagen and his wife had a third child last year. This made them sell a second car and bought a van. The sixth and seventh seat are used to put other things, for a family of five must carry many suitcases  when they travel. When they arrive at their grandparents' home, the suitcases are brought into the home and the two seats can then carry the grandparents. Americans call vans motor homes. A motor home is always used for holidays. When a family are traveling to the mountains or to the seaside, they can live in their motor home for a few days or weeks.

A college dropout and self-taught engineer, Kamen already held over 100 patents for his inventions when he developed the one he hoped would revolutionize short-distance travel.While still in college, Kamen started developing the medical devices   that made his name.Later, he changed focus to the challenges faced by wheelchair users.His robotic wheelchair known as IBOT could climb stairs.This robot ended up paving the way for the Segway. Before showing his most recent invention, Kamen had kept it a top secret for months.When it turned out to be little more than a motor scooter, many publicly expressed their disappointment.On closer examination, however, even his critics  had to admit that the vehicle was an engineering achievement.It answered the prayers of anyone who is worn out when walking downtown.Not everyone welcomed the Segway's arrival, though.Some complained it was too expensive, while others said it would further weaken the average American ' s fitness.A Japanese inventor even accused Kamen of stealing the idea for the Segway from him. Despite the controversy, the U.S.postal service began using Kamen's invention a month after its appearance, and a factory was built with plans to produce about 40,000 Segways every month.The argument is still on whether the Segway will be remembered as the greatest invention since the light bulb, or just another forgettable electronic device.Anyway, trips to the local supermarket will never be the same again.

First, it is very cheap to buy a bike, and it is quick, too. You often need to wait for a bus for half an hour. When the bus comes, there are so many other buses and cars on the roads, so the bus moves very slowly. I travel to work by bus for about four years. I often arrive at work late and feel tired. Then one day, a friend of mine says, \"I go to work by bike. Why don't we travel together?\" \"Because my bike is old, and there are so many buses and cars on the roads. I'll feel frightened.\" I answer. \"Don't be afraid, if you follow me and we ride slowly, you'll be fine.\" he says. Later, I buy a new bike. We go slowly, but we arrive at work quickly.

      "question": "She's not afraid of anything. Snakes? No problem. Walking alone in the dark? Easy. We're not talking about a superhero here -- SM is a 44-year-old mother.  And she's fearless because she happens to be missing part of her brain: the amygdala . Shaped like a pair of almonds sitting in the middle of your brain, the amygdala helps control fear and anxiety. A rare condition called Urbach-Wiethe disease left SM without her amygdala, and seems to have completely erased her sense of fear. To try to understand how the amygdala works, a team of researchers made their efforts to scare SM. They showed her horror movies and took her to the Waverly Hills Sanatorium Haunted House in Kentucky. She pushed out one of the monsters  and laughed. SM said she didn't like snakes, but at a pet store full of poisonous creatures, she kept asking to touch them. When asked to rate her feelings, SM reported feeling surprised or disgusted, but never fearful. \"She tends to approach everything she should be avoiding,\" says Justin Feinstein of the  University of Iowa. This means the amygdala could control deeper urges to approach or avoid danger. Other scientists have a different opinion, though.  \"I don't believe you can make a general statement about what the amygdala does by a single case study,\" Elizabeth Phelps said. In 2002, Phelps published a study on a similar patient with amygdala damage who still showed fear. It may sound like fun to be totally fearless, but we get scared for a good reason. \"The nature of fear is survival and the amygdala helps us stay alive by avoiding situations, people, or objects that put our life in danger,\" Feinstein said. SM was once followed in a park after dark by a man with a knife, and she simply walked away. \"It is quite remarkable that she is still alive,\" said Feinstein.

      "question": "For millions of years, sharks have been the kings of the oceans, the top of the food chain. But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins  to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back.     Shark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. The competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season.     \"I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing   them, and very rarely killing them and eating them,\" he said. \"If I thought killing one shark was endangering   the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow.\"   That is exactly what marine biologists like Luke Tipple want to happen. \"I believe that they should just stop it. In fact, we don't need to be targeting, in any way, any of these threatened populations,\" he said. Up to 73 million sharks are killed annually, and many species are at risk of extinction  .

      "question": "We convey   information through the position and movement of the body. We often use gestures or body movements to stress what we are saying. For example, when I lecture  , I often use my hands to emphasize   points or point to something on the blackboard. Some people use them more than others. The victory   sign, the OK sign, the goodbye wave and the blowing of a kiss are all popular gestures in America. It is important to recognize, however, that most gestures are not universally recognized. For example, although the OK gesture means acceptance in prefix = st1 /America, it has other meanings in other cultures. InFranceit means worthlessness. And in Greece, it is considered obscene  .      There are some sex differences in nonverbal behavior. In American culture, men tend to sit or stand with legs apart and hands outward, while women tend to keep legs together and hands at their sides. Women are also better than men at understanding nonverbal gestures.      A nonverbal behaviour is to have the tongue just slightly protruding   from the mouth. A study showed that people were less willing to approach others who had their tongues showing. Perhaps this is why people often tend to avoid individuals with bad nonverbal behaviours.

      "question": "We all know that eating junk food can make us fat. However, a new study suggests that it can do more than that - it can also make us lazy, reported CBS News. In the study, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, US divided 32 female rats into two groups. The first group was fed a diet of healthy food such as corn and fish, while the second was given a diet of highly processed   food rich in sugar, namely \"junk food\". Within three months, the rats in the second group were already much fatter than those on the healthy diet. And when researchers trained the rats to do simple tasks, they found even more differences between the two groups rather than weight. During the task - pushing a lever   to receive a reward of sugar water - the rats on the junk food diet were found to be less willing to move, and they took longer breaks between each push than the lean rats did. \"It is as if the rat is thinking 'This is too much work',\" Aaron Blaisdell, leader of the study, told the Los Angeles Times. But what about the possibility that the fat rats were less passionate about getting sugar water because they were already eating lots of sugar in their daily diet? That's why researchers repeated the tests by rewarding fat rats with plain water when they were extremely thirsty. However, the results came out just the same. According to researchers, these differences suggest that junk food changed the chemistry in the rats' brains. The experiment didn't end _ . After six months, the rats' diets were switched, and the overweight rats were given a healthy diet for nine days. However, this change didn't help reduce their weight or improve their ability to perform tasks, which means the effects of their junk food diet persisted  . \"There's no quick fix,\" said Blaisdell. For a long time, we've believed that people become fat because they are lazy. But this study has proven the opposite to be true as well, which indicates that laziness and obesity are a \"vicious cycle  \".

      "question": "It is important for countries to develop. Sometimes development can do more harm than good for a country. Therefore, this development needs to be different from past development, which polluted the environment and wasted natural resources. One possible solution to this problem now being discussed is sustainable development. It focuses on preserving the environment and natural resources. It is all about creating better health care, education, housing and improved standard of living for everyone. This is a simple idea, but one that is hard to put into practice. However, it is something that we must do, because without sustainable development our future and the lives of our children and our grandchildren will be in danger. Nearly everything we do in our modern lives requires the use of the Earth's natural resources. These natural resources provide the energy for many important things. The list is almost endless. For all these things, we mostly depend on fuels such as coal, gas and oil to produce energy. We are now consuming these fuels at a much higher rate than they are being produced. On top of this, burning these fuels produces carbon dioxide, which is harmful to the environment. This is why many people are pushing for the use of alternative energy sources. Alternative energy sources can be used without running out. Some examples of the alternatives are solar energy, wind energy and hydroelectricity. As people are becoming more aware of the need to protect the environment, these types of energy are becoming more and more popular. In many parts of the world, tentative  steps are being taken to introduce these forms of alternative energy. For example, some people in Nigeria are training to use solar power, and in Costa Rica, people are now using hydroelectricity to provide power for their small villages. The introduction of programmes like these will hopefully help end the systematic destruction of the environment and see alternative energy promoted around the world. This will mean good things for our future, our children's future and our grandchildren's future. Hydroelectricity means   _  .",

In 1930, Neumann visited Princeton University for a year and then became a professor there.His first book was published in 1932.In 1933, the Institute for Advanced Study was formed, and he became one of the 6 full-time people in the School of Mathematics (Einstein was one of the others). World War II hugely changed Neumann's areas of interest.Until 1940 he had been a great pure   mathematician.During and after the war, he became one of the best mathematicians who put mathematics theories into practice.During the last part of the war he became interested in computing machines and made several contributions.After the war, Neumann continued his work with computers, and was generally very active in government service.He received many awards, was president of American Mathematical Society and was a member of the Atomic Energy Commission.He died in 1957 of cancer. Neumann really was a legend  in his own time, and there are a number of stories about him.His driving ability is a part of this legend.He reported one accident this way: \"I was driving down the road.The trees on the right were passing me in an orderly fashion at 60 miles per hour.Suddenly one of them stepped in my path.\" Which of the following is true of Neumann?",

It's a new form of advertising in the sky that's never been used before. It's a different way to market your products, logos, and events. These funny logos are made with soap bubbles   mixed with a little helium gas   ,which makes them lighter than air and float in the sky. Special machines are used to make these new funny Flogos. The machine, which can be rented for $ 2,500 a day, can make a Flogo every 15-25 seconds. Flogos can fly much higher or lower if needed. They can last from a few minutes to an hour anywhere in the sky, depending on the weather conditions. Though they can fly up to 20, 000 feet, they usually float around at 300- 500 feet. Flogos are only white now, but people hope to have more colorful Flogos in the near future.

Adam Kerr, 12, from Armagh, Northern Ireland, also helps his mother care for his younger brother Brian, 9, who suffers from the genetic disease Fanconi's anaemia  . But it is not the first hardship that has affected young Adam. When he was just six, he donated his own bone marrow to his younger sister Helen who suffered from a rare blood disorder. Sadly she developed complications and died a few months after the operation in 2005. Adam found it very difficult to be happy after Helen's death. So he decided to start raising money in memory of Helen to help local poor children and families with bereavement  . Overall he has raised PS10,000 and he has no intentions of giving up. He organised a Fun Day to provide the money for a brother and sister from Northern Ireland to visit their sick brother having a bone marrow transplant in a London hospital. He received his award and a cheque forPS2,000 at an \"Oscar's style\" ceremony in London. Ms Phillips said: \"Adam is an incredible young man.

      "question": "In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \"gentleman in white\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel.     When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization.     Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross. Why did Henry Dunant go to the battlefield?",

      "question": "When Nick Pasqua hits his bedroom after school, he's tired. The 14-year-old high school freshman from New Rochele, New York, plays computer video games online for a couple of hours, pausing only to instant-message his friends, check his blog or download a new song to his IPOD. When his cell phone vibrates , he scans the text message and fires back a reply. \"We're leagues behind,\" sighs Nick's mom, Kimberly Pasqua, 45. And many parents like her are feeling increasingly out of step with their children. The technology gap between parents and kids is widening, says Amenda Lenhart, senior research specialist for Internet & American Life Project, a research group that explores the impact of the Internet on children and families. In a series of reports released last year, researchers found that 87 percent of the prefix = st1 /United States' kids aged 12 to 17 use the Internet, compared to only 66 percent of adults. Half of those teens go online daily. Eighty-one percent play games online and 75 percent use instant-messaging. Nearly half(45 percent) have a cell phone. One out of five has a blog. Why are children increasing past their parents? Because today's kids learn to use computers by playing and think technology is fun, says Lenhart. But adults generally view computers as mere tools for work , not toys. Despite this difference, most parents realize that computers, cell phones and the like are fixtures  in their children's lives. With that acceptance comes worry about what makes appropriate usage and more important, what's safe. Experts say the best way to keep up is to learn the technology for yourself. Visit blogs. Send some instant and text messages.

But have you ever thought about how to take care of four to twelve old people when you grow up and get married? This could be a problem for most Chinese youths as China is entering a new stage of an aging society. An aging society refers to one where 10 percent or more of its population is over 60. By the end of 2007, Chinese over 60 years old have made up 11.7 percent of the nation's total population. \"China is getting old before becoming rich,\"said Cai Chuang, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The population increase that has powered Chinese growth for three decades will give way over the next ten years to a rapid aging of the society. This will lead to weaker economic growth, because of a lack of labor resources. As a result of the family planning policy, it is expected that the country's total working population will decrease after 2015. China is not the only country getting old. More that 60 countries have become aging societies and one in three people in the European Union is a senior citizen. However, experts said that China doesn't have a highly developed social security network to support the old. Social security is an insurance program protecting those in need, including the old, the disabled and others. What does Cai Chuang mean by saying\"China is getting old before becoming rich.\"?",

However, the findings should not stop us from keeping fit. Experts believe that willpower  is like a muscle, and needs to be exercised to help one avoid the temptation  spending a night on the couch instead. Kathleen Martin-Ginis, a professor of kinesiology-the science of movement--who led the study, says everyone has a limited amount of willpower, and that it will be reduced by stress. Miss Martin-Ginis, of Canada's McMaster University, explains,\" Cognitive  tasks, as well as tasks such as regulating one's emotions, can reduce one's capacity to force oneself to exercise. \" Her team of scientists performed a so-called \"Stroop\" test on volunteers to reach their conclusions. The experiment involved showing participants words associated with color1s but printed in different color1s-for example, the word \"blue\" written in red ink Participants were divided into two groups. One group was asked to name the color1 of the ink, instead to say the printed word, while the other wasn't Martin-Girus says, \"After we used this cognitive task to use up their self-regulatory capacity, the participants didn't exercise as hard as those who had not performed the task \" The more people concentrated on the cognitive task, the more likely they were to skip exercise sessions  over the next eight week You only have so much willpower. However, there are ways to strengthen willpower. The study found the listening to music before going to the gym can help, as well as making a commitment to work out with friends. It also concluded that willpower can be stretched by constant cake, or forcing oneself to study an extra hour each night Martin- Ginis adds,\" There are strategies people can use to help revitalize  themselves after they've used up their self-regulation Willpower is like a muscle: it needs to be used to stay strong. \" According to the experts, human willpower  _  .",

But as everything he needed was given to him without asking, Jonny became a _ . He was so spoiled by everyone that he couldn't stand any hardship. One day Johnny heard a mother saying to her son \"Come on, my boy, get up and stop crying. You are behaving like Johnny Jones.\" That made Johnny feel very ashamed. But he was sure that he would prefer to be known as a good boy rather than a fool. Worried, he spoke to his father about all this, though he was afraid that maybe he would be laughed at for having such worries. His father, far from laughing at Johnny, told him that a teacher had taught him a secret trick to turn him into the toughest boy off all. \"Eat a candy less, study a minute more, and count to five before crying.\" Johnny asked, \"Just that? \" \"Yes, just that,\" said his father, \"It's very simple, but I warn you that it won't be easy.\" Johnny was happy like a bird, ready to follow the advice. He went to see his mother, and she noticed how happy he was when she offered him candies. \"One candy less\", thought Johnny, so he only took one. That afternoon he had another chance to put it into practice by studying one minute more. The result was that he missed the first minute of his favorite program! But having achieved this gave him a great feeling of satisfaction. The same happened when he ran up against the corner of the kitchen table. He only managed to count to four before crying, but that was left deeply in his mother's memory. Over the following days Johnny kept using the motto in his life as his father told him. And the more he put this into practice ,the easier it got. Before long he realized that he could also do things that would seem impossible before.

It is unusual for what it contains: the news from local crime to international politics, from sports to business to fashion to science, and the comments and special features as well, from editorial page to feature articles, from interviews to criticism of books, art, theatre, and music. A newspaper is even more unusual for the way one reads it never completely, never straight through, but always by jumping from here to there, in and out, glancing at one piece, reading another article all the way through, reading just a few paragraphs of the next. A good modern newspaper offers a variety to attract many different readers, but far more than any one reader is interested in. What brings this variety together in one place is its _ , that is, its immediate relation to what is happening in your world and your locality now. But this immediacy and the speed of production that goes with it also mean that much of what appears in a newspaper has no more than temporary value.

Fine art treasures from many countries are kept in an art museum called the Louvre   in Paris, France. The works of art have been collected by the people of France over many centuries. It is the biggest art museum in the world. The Louvre has not always been a museum. The first building was a fort. In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew. By 1350, the castle no longer needed a fort. The Louvre became a palace home for French kings and queens. During times of peace, new treasures were brought in. During the days of war, many treasures were stolen, and the buildings were damaged. When Francis I became king of France in 1515, he brought in many artists from other countries. One of the artists was Lenardo da Vinci from Italy. Da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" is the best known painting in the museum today. In 1793, the Louvre became a public museum.

      "question": "The creative projects of World Food Program (WFP) focused on preventing hunger from taking hold in the future and breaking the cycle of hunger. Here are some of the ways in which we work to prevent hunger in the future: School Meals As well as directly addressing hunger, School Meals projects encourage families to keep their children in school and help them build better futures. If children aren't hungry they will concentrate on their lessons. With a solid education growing children have a better chance of finding their own way out of hunger. These projects benefit girls especially. For more information: www.wfp.org/schools meals. Food for Assets  WFP's Food for Assets projects provide the hungry with food to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. When poor farmers no longer have to worry about the next meal, they have the time and energy to build irrigation  systems that can increase production. Similarly, Food for Training projects allow the poor to devote time to learning skills that will sustain  them economically in the future. For more information: www.wfp.org/food-assets. HIV/AIDS WFP uses its food rations  to reduce the blow of HIV and AIDS. The agency distributes its rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, so they can keep providing for their families for longer and have time to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children--the next generation of food providers in developing countries. For more information: www.wfp.org/hiv-aids. Purchase for Progress WFP buys large amounts of food in developing countries. It has this purchasing power and uses it to help poor farmers contact reliable markets where they can get competitive prices for their produce.

However, a group of senior Chinese ladies dancing in New York's Sunset Park were recently faced with noise complaints from nearby residents. The local court even served a summons   related to a certain Ms. Wang. The news soon caused heated discussion across China, with many believing the incident to involve a cultural conflict between the East and West,while others view it as a form of discrimination against Chinese in the United States. The United States is a diverse society, and in many cases, Chinese dancers are tolerated and even appreciated. Meanwhile, the United States is a society based on the rule of law, and due to cultural differences, local regulations seem to be very different from those in China. As a result, some old Chinese ladies dancing in New York's Sunset Park found themselves caught in an embarrassing situation. Locals and immigrants from other nations view such noise as a violation of their right to enjoy _ . Calling the police is regarded as the most efficient way to solve such a problem. Before, these ladies probably did not understand local customs and rules. However, since the incident took place, they should perhaps know a little better next time and keep the noise to a minimum.

That's not very different from the way our parents saw themselves. But with more two-career families and busy schedules, one thing parents today recognize more than ever is the need to set aside special time for their children. These 'nurturing moments' are changed into memories that they will treasure all their lives. Nurturing moments might be the time between our work and life,bringing your child to work with you to see what you do during the day,visiting your child's make-believe world,discussing his other school day and exploring the natural world outside your door. These times are not merely a luxury  , they're a necessity. It's during these moments that parents pass values and attitudes to their children. Over time, children pick up good habits and positive self-image. Here are a few tips for making the most of your family time together: Regularly sit down as a family to share a meal. Allow each person to describe something interesting about his or her day. Make one night a week family night. Family members take turns choosing a special activity for the evening everyone partakes in the fun. Show your children you care about their interests by having them teach you about their activity or hobby. Nurturing healthy children involves body, mind and spirit.

It was at the end of 2001 that Mel Young, a famous expert in the media inDustry, came up with the idea of the Homeless World Cup. 18 months later the first event took place in Austria. It was such a success that people decided to do more. There are some interesting and special rules of the event. For example, players(male or female at least 16 years old) must have been homeless at some time after the previous year's World Cup or make their main living income by selling newspapers in the street or be asylum  seekers . Anyone can take part, regardless of his or her abilities. There are at most 4 players per team to compete in the field. Games are 14 minutes long.

      "question": "Have you wondered why you have two eyes and why they are set close together on the front of your face? The reasons are simple and important to the way you see the rest of your world. Your eyes are like two small cameras. A camera catches an image of an object and records it on film.Similarly,when you look at something,each eye takes in what it sees and sends this image to the back of the eyeball.Because your eyes are set close together,they view the world from about the same height but from slightly different angles. Working as a team, the eyes send the images to your brain, which puts them together into a single, centered image. Seeing in stereo means seeing with two eyes working together,which is called stereoscopic sight.This allows you to view the world in three dimensions,or 3-D.Seeing depth helps you to judge the distance between you and the objects you see and to adjust to the changing angle at which you see something as you move closer to or farther away from it.If images are coming from only one eye, however,only two of these dimensions-height and width-can be perceived.A world seen with one eye is thus two-dimensional,as in a photograph. Now consider why your two eyes are on the front of your face.Think of other animals with this same arrangement.They are all animals that hunt,like lions and wolves.Their eyes face directly in front of them.This provides a field of sight about 180 degrees wide,which is called binocular sight.On the other hand,animals that are hunted have eyes on the sides of the head,which provides nearly 360-degree field of sight.In order to stay alive,they need to see things coming from the sides and from behind.However,without stereoscopic sight,they have difficulty determining how far a danger is. With sight both stereoscopic and binocular,humans share with animal hunters the ability to  see from side to side and to accurately determine the distance.If you think it would be great to  have another type of sight,perhaps with hundreds of tiny eyes like many insects do,think again! Each tiny insect eye sees only a tiny part.Besides,what if you needed glasses? Be glad for the  eyesight that you have. According to the passage,an eye is like a camera because both",

      "question": "In 2003, Bethany Hamilton,13, lost her left arm to a shark attack while surfing off Kauai, Hawaii. A new film ,Soul Surfer, is based on the story of how she overcame that to achieve her dream of becoming a professional athlete. Growing up on the \"garden isle\" of Kauai, Hamilton spent every minute she could riding the waves. She was on the verge of   becoming a top competitor in professional surfing. But while she was practicing at an isolated cove  ,a four-meter-long tiger shark ripped off her left arm. Though her life was saved, nobody could imagine she would ever get back on a surfboard again. In a true test of her faith and by _ will power, Bethany did get back up on a surfboard only a month after the attack. Six months later, she was competing again. Bethany Hamilton won her first amateur surfing championship just two years after she lost her arm. She also established the \"Friends of Bethany,\" a non---profit foundation dedicated to supporting sharks attack victims. It's a story told in her autobiography, which is the basis for the film that stars teenager Anna Sophia Robb. \"I knew Bethany's story, of course, but I thought 'What an incredible role' ,\"explains Robb. \"I was so fascinated by all of the challenges. What would it be like to have your arm taken and what would go through your head and how would your faith be challenged?\" The filmmakers used special effects to digitally remove Robb' s arm .However ,no tricks were necessary for the surfing scenes because Hamilton herself did the breathtaking wave riding. Now 21, Hamilton says she hopes audiences find inspiration in the description of the sport she loves. \"Not a lot of people know that much about surfing, so I hope they're educated about it,\" Hamilton says. \"And most of all if people are going through a hard time, they could be encouraged and find inspiration to push through those hard times and see that, in my case ,so much good has come out of it.\" How does Hamilton hope people will be affected by her story?",

      "question": "An African farmer had heard tales about other farmers who had made millions of dollars by discovering diamond mines. These tales so excited the farmer that he could hardly wait to sell his farm and go prospecting for diamonds himself. So he sold the farm and spent the rest of his life wandering the African continent, searching unsuccessfully for the shining stone that brought such high prices on the markets of the world. Finally, broke and worn out, he threw himself into a river and drowned. Meanwhile, back at the farm, the man who had bought his farm happened to be crossing a small river on the property one day when he saw something shining at the bottom of the river. He picked it up. It was a sparkling stone - a good size stone - and, admiring it, he later put it on his fireplace mantel  as an interesting curiosity. Several weeks later, a visitor admired the stone, looked closely at it, lifted it in his hand and nearly fainted. He asked the farmer if he knew what he'd found. When the farmer said no, that he thought it was just a piece of crystal, the visitor told him he had found one of the largest diamonds ever discovered. The farmer was astonished. He told the man that his small river was full of these brilliant stones, and his farmland was covered with them. Not all were as large, perhaps, as the one on his mantel, but they were sprinkled generously throughout his property. Needless to say, the farm the first farmer had sold, so that he could search for a diamond mine, turned out to be the most productive diamond mine on the entire African continent.

Read page 12 through 20 of the Shakespeare play, and when you have finished that, don't forget to fill the missing chemical symbols on the Periodic Table of Elements worksheet. Homework is a major part of going to class, and it helps students grasp important concepts. Luckily, you can do a few things to make homework less painful. First, be sure you understand the assignment. Write it down in your notebook or day planner if you need to, and don't be afraid to ask questions about what is expected. It is much easier to take a minute to ask the teacher during or after class than to struggle to remember later at night! Second, use any extra time you have in school to work on your homework. Many schools have study halls that are specifically designed to allow students to study or get homework done. It is attractive to hang out with friends during study periods or unscheduled time, but the more work you can get done in school, the less you will have to do at night. Third, pace yourself. If you don't finish your homework during school, think about how much you have left and what else is going on that day, and then budget your time. Most high school students have between 1 and 3 hours of homework a night. If it is a heavy-homework day and it seems like you have got an assignment on every subject but gym and lunch, you will need to devote more time to homework schedule, especially if you are involved in sports or activities or have an after-school job.

      "question": "Are you a compulsive spender,or do you hold on to your money as long as possible? Are you a bargain hunter? Would you rather use charge accounts than pay in cash? Your answers to these questions will reflect your personality.According to psychologists,our individual money habits not only show our beliefs and values,but can also stem from past problems. Experts in psychology believe that for many people,money is an important symbol of strength and influence.Husbands who complain about their wives' spending habits may be afraid that they are losing power in their marriage.Wives,on the other hand,may waste huge amounts of money because they are angry at their husbands.In addition,many people consider money a symbol of love.They spend it on their family and friends to express love,or they buy themselves expensive presents because they need love. People can be addicted to different things --for example,alcohol,drugs,certain foods,or even television.They are compulsive in their addictions,i.e.they must satisfy these needs to feel comfortable.In the same way,according to psychologists,compulsive spenders must spend money. For people who buy on credit,furthermore,charge accounts are even more exciting than money:in other words,they feel that with credit,they can do anything.Their pleasures in spending enormous amounts are actually greater than _ they get from the things they buy. There is even a special psychology of bargain hunting.To save money,of course,most people look for sales,low prices,and discounts.Compulsive bargain hunters,however,often buy things that they don't need just because they are cheap.They want to believe that they are helping their budgets,but they are really playing an exciting game:when they can buy something for less than other people,they feel that they are winning.Most people,experts claim,have two reasons for their behavior:a good reason for the things that they do and the real reason. It is not only scientists,of course,who understand the psychology of spending habits,but also business people.Stores,companies,and advertisers use psychology to increase business:they consider people's needs for love,power,or influence,their basic values,their beliefs and opinions, etc.in their advertising and sales methods. Psychologists often use a method called \"behavior therapy \"to help individuals solve their personality problems.In the same way,they can help people who feel that they have problems with money:they give them \"assignments\" If a person buys something in every store that he enters, for instance,a therapist might teach him self discipline in this way:on the first day of his therapy, he must go into a store,stay five minutes,and then leave.On the second day,he should stay for ten minutes and try something on.On the third day,he stays for fifteen minutes,asks the salesclerk a question,but does not buy anything.Soon he will learn that nothing bad will happen to him if he doesn't buy anything,and he can solve the problem of his compulsive buying.

Rao's,the East Harlem restaurant with a history of more than l00 years,is simply the toughest restaurant to get a reservation in the US, if not the world.Michelin three-star restaurants like elBulli in Spain,often ranked the world's top restaurant,would sell out the second phone lines opened.But in the case of Rao's,the phone lines never open. There are about a dozen tables in the tiny restaurant, and each is spoken for, semi-permanently, as regulars have had their reservations for years, and when they can't use them,they often gift them to friends. The place is so small that the owners rarely have the flexibility to do favors even for people they know. Since it is always busy,there has never been a need for publicity.The last remarkable national review of the restaurant came from The New York Times more than 35 years ago.It was already tough to get a table at Rao's but reservations have been non-existent ever sincce the magic review. According to a critic who is \"very, very lucky to have dined at Rao's a few times,\"the experience rivals the tasty food.There are no menus at Rao's, and one of the owners will pull up a chair and run through the massive list of options, allowing people to have diner by mixing and matching nearly any ingredient with any classical Italian style of cooking. The place doesn't take credit cards, isn't open on weekends or for 1unch, and \"at some point during your meal the one-room restaurant will almost unavoidably break out in song.\" It is truly one of a kind,\"the critic wrote.

      "question": "Six years ago, a Miami woman walking through the hall of an office building casually noticed two men standing together. Several minutes after her leaving, the men murdered a person working in the building. Police investigators determined that the woman was the only witness who had seen the two suspects, and could possibly describe them. In an interview with police, her memory of the men proved disappointingly unclear. Several days later, psychologist Ronald P. Fisher was brought in to get a more complete description from the woman. Fisher's interview produced a breakthrough--the woman reported a clear picture of one of the suspects. She then recalled several details about his appearances. This information gave police important leads that enabled them to arrest the suspects and close the case.  Police investigators found the help from Fisher because of his rich knowledge in conducting the so-called cognitive   interview, a kind of memory-rebuilding process. In its original form, the cognitive interview focuses on guiding witnesses through four general recalling techniques: thinking about physical surroundings and personal feelings that existed at the time of past events, reporting everything that comes to mind about those events no matter how broken or unconnected, retelling events in kinds of time orders, beginning to end, end to beginning, forward or backward, and accepting different views while recalling events. Usually, an interviewer begins the cognitive approach by encouraging the witness to take an active role in recalling information rather than giving answers only to someone else's questions. The witness first describes what happened in his or her own words, with no interviewer interruptions. The interviewer then goes further with specific techniques, such as having the witness tell the details of what happened from different aspects. Experiments with police detectives trained in this demanding interview method find that they get nearly 50% more information from witnesses than before training, while error rates remain about the same. It can be inferred from the passage that in a cognitive interview, the interviewer mainly plays a   _   role.",

The group's position was approved by some experts. \"There is very little one can do in order to increase the chance of having a healthy brain when you get old,\" said Dr. Hans Forstl, who has studied boxing injuries. \" One of the best things you can do is avoid boxing.\" He said. According to the new statement, published in the journal Pediatrics, information from Canada shows a rise in boxing injuries over the past decade. Pat Russo, a retired police officer who runs a boxing gym in Brooklyn, New York, said injuries are rare in amateur boxing. After 26 years and training thousands of kids, he has seen just one split lip among his students. \" If the gym is run properly, injuries are at an absolute minimum,\" Russo said. \"Football is ten times more dangerous. While tennis or football might also help kids gain confidence, boxing holds a special attraction for children in poor neighborhoods, because it allows them to act tough while in trouble.\" Dr. Robert Cantu, a surgeon   at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts, said AAP's attitude makes sense for upper-class and middle-class kids. \" Clearly boxing is safer today than it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still a very risky activity,\" he said. \"For kids in poor areas, however, the situation is different,\" said Cantu. \" The most dangerous thing for the majority of people in boxing is just where they live.

      "question": "Every profession or trade, every art, and every science has its technical vocabulary, the function of which is partly to refer to things or processes which have no names in ordinary English, and partly to secure greater exactness in expression. Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula . Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole,  _  Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn. Most of the new coinages are restricted to special discussions and seldom get into general literature or conversation. Yet no profession is nowadays, as all profession once were, a closed guild  . The lawyer, the physician, the man of science, and the cleric   associate freely with his fellow creatures, and do not meet them in a merely professional way. Furthermore, what is called popular science makes everybody acquainted with modern views and recent discoveries. Any important experiment, though made in a remote laboratory, is at once reported in the newspapers, and everybody is soon talking about it--as in the case of the Roentgen rays and wireless telegraphy.

Two years later, he invited her to play against his friends. She has returned several times after that. Earlier this year after winning a position on the U.S. team, she took a few points off Buffett and Gates. When asked whether he has won a point off Hsing, Gates said, \"She beat me when she was nine. She has been nice to me.\" What did Bill Gates think of Li Xiaoxia?",

      "question": "Most of us seem to reach our peak of alertness   around noon. Soon after that, alertness declines, and sleepiness may set in by mid-afternoon. Your short-term memory is best during the morning--in fact, about 15 percent more efficient than at any other time of day. So, students, take notice: when you are faced with a morning exam, _ to review your notes right before the test is given. However, long-term memory is different. Afternoon is the best time for learning materials that you want to recall days, weeks or months later. Politicians, business executives or others who must learn speeches would be smart to do their memorizing during that time of day. You should try to do most of your studying in the afternoon, rather than late at night. Many students believe they memorize better while burning the midnight oil because their short-term recall is better during the early hours of the morning than in the afternoon. But short-term memory won't help them much several days later, when they face the exam. By contrast, we tend to do best on tasks related to the process of knowing, understanding, and learning numbers during the morning hours. What about sports? During afternoon and early evening, you're able to react the quickest to an outside stimulus--like a baseball speeding toward you. Studies have also shown that late in the day, when your body temperature is peaking, you will consider PE easier and less tiring--whether it actually is or not. That means you are more likely to work harder during a late afternoon or early evening workout, and therefore benefit more from it. In fact, all of your senses--taste, sight, hearing, touch and smell--may be at their keenest during late afternoon and early evening. That could be why dinner usually tastes better to us than breakfast. While all of us follow the same general pattern of ups and downs, the exact timing varies from person to person. It all depends on how your \"biological\" day is structured. Each of us can increase our knowledge about our individual rhythms. Learn how to listen to the inner beats of your body; let them set the pace of your day. You will live a healthier and happier life. Which would be the best title for the passage?",

And next year,Rowena will be attending Harvard University.Billy,her younger brother,hopes to go to Cornell.What makes Rowena and Billy different from most students is that they don't go to school.In fact,they've never been to school.Since kindergarten,they've studied at home.Like many of more than one million people who receive home schooling in the United States, they feel as if they've gotten a good education. The home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job? The answer in many cases is yes.In many studies,students taught at home ranked average or above average when compared to students who went to public schools.More importantly,these students were often more self-directed and have a greater depth of knowledge.They were well prepared for academic challenges. One such student,Robert Conrad, now a sophomore at university, claims he really learned how to study and schedule his time during his eight years of home schooling.Still, not every student is as successful as Robert. \"For every home-schooling success story,there are an equal number of failures.\"states Henry Lipscomb,an educational researcher.\"There are just so many disadvantages that students taught at home have to overcome.\" For example,they have fewer chances to get in touch with others of their own age.Consequently,they sometimes lack the usual social skills.\"No matter what,though,\"states Lipscomb,\"home-schooling is a growing trend.I think we'll be seeing more and more of this.\" The best title of this text might be   _   .",

      "question": "In Sonoma County, California, growers are planting grapevines in a new way. As they plant the vines, they add a package of water called DRiWATER. This method of planting grapevines along with the water supply saves time and work. It gives the plant enough water to keep growing. The workers can go on to other chores. DRiWATER is a package of jelled   water. It melts slowly, watering the plant for two or three months. DRiWATER is a 100% natural, non-poisonous product used for the long-term watering of plants. It was invented by a well-known food chemist who recognized the potential of a filler product he was using to thicken peanut butter. He tested and applied his theory that water could be released over time as naturally occurring microbes   in the soil fed on the filler and released the water into the soil. The inventor, Harold Jensen, tried for a long time to get the right recipe. He and his family worked nights and weekends testing different formulas. Jensen finally found the right formula and patented it. What are the ingredients in DRiWATER? It is made up of 97.85% water, 2% vegetable gum, and 0.15% aluminum sulfate. When the DRiWATER is planted in the soil, the water is released as bacteria eat the jell. Buchanan Vineyard Services has bought ten thousand packages of DRiWATER. They will plant the jelled water with their new grapevines. What about countries like Egypt that have large deserts? Maybe DRiWATER will help grow trees in the desert. Two million trees have been planted near a town in the Sahara Desert. Two quarts were planted with each tree. The tree must live on the water for months until its roots touch ground water. Harold Jensen hopes to see forests spring up in the deserts. This is the reason that he invented DRiWATER. Seedlings, DRiWATER, and desert may be the perfect fit.

Bai Minghui, a Beijing-based designer, creates his artwork using Tyvek, a synthetic  paper material which is difficult to tear, waterproof and, more importantly, totally recyclable. Born to a worker family in 1983 in Tangshan, Hebei Province, Bai worked as a graphic designer at a financial magazine in Beijing after graduating from Minzu University of China. In the spring of 2008, Bai visited an exhibition about Tyvek in Beijing's 798 art zone, and then worked with the material, trying to bring his designs to life. The first thing that came into his mind was the paper wallet, a must-try handicraft assignment that most Chinese students do in elementary school. \"A paper wallet is definitely more useful than a paper crane or frog,\" Bai told Beijing Review, smiling. \"At first, many people have no idea what it is, because it looks like a piece of newspaper or an express parcel receipt, and feels like real paper. But it's hard to tear.\" \"The completed, folded wallet is seamless , which creates so much fun for a designer. To be honest, I didn't think about profits at all,\" he said. After months of research and development on printing and designing, the first generation of his paper wallet made a stunning debut in May 2008. The second generation, which offers a greater range of pattern options, was put on the market at the beginning of 2009. \"You can have graffiti or write down phone numbers on it, or paint whatever you like. I would like people to be able to use it easily,\" he said. \"I don't want to do things without creative ideas.

      "question": "People who have lost the ability to understand or use words due to brain damage are called aphasics . Such patients can be extremely good at something else. From the changing expressions on speakers' faces and the tones of their voices, they can tell lies from truths. Doctors studying the human brain have given a number of examples of this amazing power of aphasics. Some have even compared this power to that of a dog with an ability to find out the drugs hidden in the baggage. Recently, scientists carried out tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasics. It was proved that the aphasics were far ahead of the normal people in recognizing false speeches -- in most cases, the normal people were fooled by words, but the aphasics were not. Some years ago, Dr. Oliver Sacks wrote in his book about his experiences with aphasics. He mentioned a particular case in a hospital. Some aphasics were watching the president giving a speech on TV. Since the president had been an actor earlier, making a good speech was no problem for him. He was trying to put his feelings into every word of his speech. But his way of speaking had the opposite effect on the patients. They didn't seem to believe him. Instead, they burst into laughter. The aphasics knew that the president did not mean a word of what he was saying. He was lying! Many doctors see aphasics as people who are not completely normal because they lack the ability to understand words. However, according to Dr. Sacks, they are more gifted than normal people. Normal people may get carried away by words. Aphasics seem to understand human expressions better, though they cannot understand words. What do we learn from this text?",

      "question": "Smoking is the single worst thing you can do for your health. Fortunately, it's never too late to get the benefits of quitting. If you've tried to quit before and failed, it's time to make up your mind and try again. Smoking is responsible for one of every five deaths. That includes 29% of all cancer deaths, 87% of all lung cancer deaths, and nearly 20% of all deaths from cardiovascular disease. But long before smoking kills you, it ages you. You can see for yourself that smoking accelerates the drying and wrinkling of the skin. But there are less obvious effects as well. Indeed, smoking takes years away from your life. Nearly half of all chronic smokers die an average of 20 to 25 years before their time. Besides an early death from cancer or heart disease, smoking can cause lung disorders. People who smoke over a pack a day have almost three times the risk of contracting pneumonia  than that of nonsmokers. By lowering levels of estrogen in men and women, smoking speeds bone less. If a woman smokes a pack of cigarettes every day, she will enter menopause with 5 to 10% less bone mass than a nonsmoker. The good news is that no matter what your age is or how long you've smoked, you'll live longer if you quit today. The Coronary Artery Surgery Study examined nearly 2,000 long-term smokers over age 54. Those who quit had significantly lower death rates six years later than those who didn't. Even the oldest ex-smokers had a higher survival rate. Not only will live longer if you quit, you'll feel better, breathe easier, and find that you have more energy. You'll have fewer respiratory infections,headaches, and stomachaches. What's more, you'll save money. Your clothes and breath won't smell unpleasant any longer. And your habit won't annoy--or threaten the health of --the people who live and work with you. According to the passage, the percentage of deaths due to smoking is   _  .",

Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeare's life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. \"People have seen Shakespeare as a Dick Whittington figure, who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die,\" he said. \"But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of Shakespeare, the man of Stratford.\" The anniversary of the death of the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world will be marked across Britain and the globe. Macbeth is about to open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeare's Globe is completing the first world tour, in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country. North Korea is still holding out, though. The Globe director recently jokily claimed Shakespeare as a true Londoner. Stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare. \"His old school room in Stratford-on-Avon where Shakespeare learned 'small Latin and less Greek' --as kindly laughed at by his friend Ben Johnson--will open its doors, scarred by centuries of naughty schoolboys, to mark 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death,\" said Paul Edmondson. Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the town, when he had made his fortune on the London stage. \"You don't buy a house like New Place and not live there,\" Paul said.

More people are made homeless by environmental disasters than by war,according to the research by the Red Cross. That reality is proved by the earthquake in Pakistan.

      "question": "It's rare that you see the words \"shyness\" and \"leader\" in the same sentence. After all, the common viewpoint is that those outgoing and sociable guys make great public speakers and excellent networkers and that those shy people are not. A survey conducted by USA Today referred to 65 percent of executives who believed shyness to be a barrier to leadership. Interestingly, the same article stresses that roughly 40 percent of leaders actually are quite shy--they're just better at adapting themselves to situational demands. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Charles Schwab are just a few \"innies\". Unlike their outgoing counterparts who are more sensitive to rewards and risk-taking, shy people take a cautious approach to chance. Rather than the flashy chit-chat that defines social gathering, shy people listen attentively to what others say and absorb it before they speak. They're not thinking about what to say while the other person is still talking, but rather listening so they can learn what to say. Along the same lines, shy people share a common love of learning. They are intrinsically  motivated and therefore seek content regardless of achieving an outside standard. Being shy can also bring other benefits. Remember being in school and hearing the same kids contribute, until shy little Johnny, who almost never said a word, cut in? Then what happened? Everyone turned around to look with great respect at little Johnny actually talking. This is how shy people made good use of their power of presence:they \"own\" the moment by speaking calmly and purposefully, which translate to a positive image. Shyness is often related to modesty. Not to say that limelight-seekers aren't modest, but shy people tend to have an accurate sense of their abilities and achievements. As a result, they are able to acknowledge mistakes, imperfections, knowledge gaps and limitations. Since shy people have a lower sensitivity to outside rewards than outgoing ones, they're more comfortable working with little information and sticking to their inner desires. Shy people are also more likely to insist on finding solutions that aren't primarily apparent. Don't believe me? Maybe you'll believe Albert Einstein, who once said, \" _ \" Obviously, finding certainty where uncertainty is typically popular is a huge plus for any successful person. The myth that shy people are less effective leaders than their outgoing fellows is just a misunderstanding.

Add the same amount of ice cubes to each container. Then put one of the containers in the plastic bag and close it tight. Put both containers in the sun together and keep them there for at least an hour. At the end of one hour remove  the container from the plastic bag and immediately check the temperature of the water. After you record this, find out the temperature of the water that is not covered. When you place the containers in direct sunlight, the air inside the bag becomes very warm.

      "question": "OSLO ( Reuters) -Six of the world's eight bear species are under threat of extinction after the addition yesterday of the sun bear, the world's smallest type of bear, to a \"Red List\" which says China's panda is most at risk. The sun bear is threatened partly by poachers   who sell its bile as medicine, said the World Conservation Union which runs the list of the threatened wildlife. \"Things are getting worse for all the bear species except the American black bear which is unquestionably increasing,\" said Simon Smart, senior species adviser for the Union. The addition of the sun bear to the authoritative \"Red List\" after a major review means the American black bear and the brown bear, found from Europe to Alaska, are the only two of eight species still considered robust  .  The sun bear, found in Asia from Bangladesh to Borneo and weighing up to about 70kg, was rated \"vulnerable  \" by experts at the Union,which consists of more than 80 governments, conservation groups and scientists. The union said there were several thousand sun bears in the wild. \"We estimate that sun bears have declined by at least 30 percent over the past 30 years, and continue to decline at this speed,\" said Ron Steinmetz, head of the Swiss- based Union's sun bear expert team. Scientists did not change the level of threat to any bear species (except sun bears). Deforestation, loss of habitat to roads and cities and poaching are among risks. The Asian black bear, the sloth bear and the Andean bear were all proved again as vulnerable after reassessment of land-living bears.  The polar, the only species not reassessed, is separately rated as vulnerable.

Because she couldn't give them one by one, Levine, then a sixth-grader, decided she would use her talents  to do the next best thing.

Her creations also went to Bundle of Joy, a program that provides newborn baby items for families in need, and to Knitting Pals by the Bay, a local organization that provides hand-knitted caps to cancer patients. \"I love to knit, and I thought it would be a great idea to make all these handmade items for kids and adults who need them.

      "question": "For many of us, a little time with our smartphones or iPads before sleep is the highlight of the night. But would you still think it is relaxing if you knew that it damages or destroys your sleep? Scientists say that's exactly what it does. In ancient times, when there were no lamps, telephones or smartphones, the sun was the main source of light. When the sun went down, our brains took that as a signal to start producing melatonin , a chemical that helps us sleep. However, a healthy amount of melatonin can only be produced in complete darkness.Any light in your bedroom--even the one on the alarm clock or the charging indicator on your cellphone--could disturb the process, not to mention something as bright as smartphone and iPad screens. We tend to hold these much closer than a television or laptop, which allows them to shoot far more light straight into our eyes. \"This is particularly worrisome in populations such as young adults and adolescents, who already tend to be _ ,\" said researcher Brittany Wood at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\"Lack of sleep among teens is leading to depression, selfharm, low concentration and poor performance at school,\" she added. While all lights are the enemy of sleep, not all colors of light have the same effect. Our eyes are particularly sensitive to blue light, which is common during the day. Most of the light coming from electronic screens is blue light and it fools our brain into thinking it's still daytime. By contrast, orange or red light has less influence on melatonin production, because our brains recognize it as a signal that the day is ending, according to The Telegraph. Asking yourself to keep your hands off your smartphone before bedtime might seem unreasonable, but you should at least remember to dim the screen or hold it farther away from your eyes. You could also wear a pair of orange sunglasses that take away the harmful blue light. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?",

The humble potato is more than just a kind of food. In many ways it's part of the American pop culture. Let's take a look at some pop culture potatoes. Mashed Potato dance The Mashed Potato dance is a craze that began in 1962. The name of the dance came from the song it accompanies, Mashed Potato Time, performed by American R&B singer Dee Dee Sharp. The move vaguely resembles that of the Twist dance style, by Sharp's fellow Philadelphian, Chubby Checker. Hot Potato! Hot Potato!  is an action puzzle video game released in 2001. In the game the player must drive a bus and clear the road of alien potato beings. The potato beings are either red or blue; when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, they disappear. .Over the years, Hot Potato! has received mostly positive reception from critics. Mr. Potato Head Mr. Potato Head is an American toy invented by George Lerner in 1949. The toy consists of a plastic potato model and a variety of plastic parts like hands, feet, ears and mouths.

      "question": "The term \"multitasking\" originally referred to a computer's ability to carry out several tasks at one time. For many people, multitasking has become a way of life and even a key to success. In fact, some excellent mental aerobic exercises involve engaging the brain in two or more challenging activities at a time. Although checking e-mail while talking on a phone and reading the newspaper may be second nature for some people, many times multitasking can make us less productive, rather than more. And studies show that too much multitasking can lead to increased stress, anxiety and memory loss. In order to multitask, the brain uses an area known as the prefrontal cortex  . Brain scans of volunteers performing multiple tasks together show that as they shift from task to task, this front part of the brain actually takes a moment of rest between tasks. You may have experienced a prefrontal cortex \"moment of rest\" yourself if you've ever dialed a phone number and suddenly forgotten who you dialed when the line is answered. What probably occurred is that between the dialing and the answering, your mind shifted to anther thought or task, and then took that \"moment\" to come back. Research has also shown that for many volunteers, job efficiency declines while multitasking, as compared to when they perform only one task at a time. Multitasking is easiest when at least one of the tasks is habitual, or requires little thought. Most people don't find it difficult to eat and read the newspaper at the same time. However, when two or more attention-requiring tasks are attempted at one time, people sometimes make mistakes. We often don't remember things as well when we're trying to manage several details at the same time. Without mental focus, we may not pay enough attention to new information coming in, so it never makes it into our memory stores. That is one of the main reasons we forget people's names--even sometimes right after they have introduced themselves. Multitasking can also affect our relationships. If someone checks their e-mail while on the phone with a friend, they may come off as absent-minded or disinterested. It can also cause that person to miss or overlook key information being passed on to them. People tend to make mistakes when   _  .",

Just to look for attention. They might think bullying is a way to be popular or a way to get what they want. Most bullies are trying to make themselves felt more important-when they pick on someone else, it makes them fell big and powerful.

Bullying can be a big pain, but you don't have to let bullying you. Sometimes just acting bravely is enough to stop a bully. If you walk by and hold your head high as though you're not afraid, a bully may be less likely to give you trouble. Bullies want a big reaction to their meanness.

      "question": "Life is like a train ride. We get on. We ride. We get off. We get back on and ride some more. There are accidents and there are delays .At certain stops, there are surprises. Some of these will change into great moments of joy; some will result in bad results. When we are born and we first get on the train, we meet people who we think will be with us for the whole journey. Those people are our parents. Sadly, this is far from the truth. Our parents are with us when we completely need them. They, too, have journeys they must complete. We live on with the memories of their love, support and so on. There are others who get on the train and who finally become very important to us. These people are our brothers, sisters and friends, whom we will learn to love and take care of. Some people regard their journey as a pleasant tour. They will just go happily along. Others will _ many upsets, tears and losses on their journey. Some others will stay on to offer a helping hand to anyone in need. Some people on the train will leave a deep impression  when they get off. Some will get on and get off the train so quickly that they will hardly leave a sign. We will sometimes be upset that some passengers, whom we love, will choose to sit in another compartment  and leave us to travel on our own. Then again, there's nothing that says we can't look for them anyway. But when we find them, we may not even be able to sit next to them because that seat will already be taken. That's okay... everyone's journey will be filled with hopes, dreams, challenges, difficulties and goodbyes. What's the best title for this passage?",

      "question": "A huge cloud of dust rose and an overpass disappeared. This was the scene in Zhuzhou,Hunan Province on May 17.Nine people were killed and 16 injured. Things were similar last year in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them? People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution. Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from \"birth\" to \"death\".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant. The secret behind the colorchanging material is a type of molecule  .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red. The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. If the bright light keeps the red color from appearing,the material's warning system will be useless. Scientists still have a lot of work to do before the colorchanging molecules can be used outside the lab. What does the passage mainly introduce?",

      "question": "Every few years comes a fitness trend that has people scratching their heads in amazement. \"Crunning\" will probably be one of them. The \"c\" stands for \"crawling\" . This new sport needs two-legged humans running on all fours! The funny idea is the brainchild of Shaun McCarthy. The 34-year-old is convinced that it will revolutionize fitness as we know it. According to the sports enthusiast, \"The only thing that crunning's changed about fitness is that it's changed everything about fitness.\" Mccarthy has no scientific evidence to prove that crunning is more efficient than traditional two-legged running. However, he believes it is a more effective way to exercise because it puts an emphasis on the shoulders and arms, providing a complete body workout. Mccarthy also says crunning seems to tire him out more. He therefore concludes that the unconventional exercise is a bigger calorie burner than normal running. While experts generally agree that crunning may provide a better workout, many are not sure if it is the right exercise for humans. Fitness coach Kevin Dean says we are not built to be on all fours and our wrists are therefore not as strong as our ankles. He believes crunning, which he calls a fad , could result in bad wrist and shoulder injuries, not to mention broken noses. But McCarthy is not worried. Since the release of his crunning video a few weeks ago, many Melbourne residents have been seen scampering around on all fours. As it turns out they are not the only ones. In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, crawling, a much slower version of crunning, has been a favorite activity for many years. According to some enthusiasts, the light exercise that is believed to date back two thousand years to the Han Dynasty, is good for curing back and spine ailments. Ready to give crunning try?

      "question": "There are lots of dangerous and terrible insects in Northeastern India, but the tree-bees are the most terrible. They are killers. Unlike most bees which will sting   you only if they are disturbed  , tree-bees will attack you in thousands for no reason. And they will chase   you for your life. Walking along a dusty road while I was on holiday there last year. I found myself, without the least warning, the centre of such an attack. The air above me suddenly became thick with bees. Though it was hot, I went cold all over. Until then I had never heard of Indian tree-bees, but I had recently seen a film called \"The Angry Swarm\", which was about killer-bees. I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered. And then I tried hard to get out of the dust, the angry bees made a new attack on me. I was tired out and ran weakly about in circles. Soon I lost my consciousness  . Later I learned that two quick-minded villagers ran to a pile of dry grass and quickly surrounded   me with a thick wall of fire and smoke until the bees were driven away. They stayed with me, taking stings out of my body for the next three hours until a doctor came and gave me further treatment. Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?",

      "question": "\"A very disruptive  six-year-old child kicked my legs and clawed at my hand,\" said one teacher. \" I broke up a fight and was kicked between my legs,\" said another. Many people have heard stories like this. But the situation is more worrying still and it involves parents. Every child, regardless of the circumstances into which they are born, has the right to achieve their potential, regardless of their parents' wealth and class. And we recognize that, as a nation, it is a long way to achieve this goal. But with rights come responsibilities and what worries people is that we are in danger of ignoring the latter. Far too many children are behaving badly at school, even to the point of being violent to staff. This is terrible enough, but it is hard to be surprised since many children are just mirroring the behaviour of their parents. My members tell me that parents also come into school often and threaten staff and some staff have been attacked by a pupil's parents. One father encouraged his child to start a fight on the playground before school started. A primary teacher reported that a parent shouted at him. We need to have a serious and sensible debate about the roles and responsibilities of parents and the support that they can reasonably expect of schools and teachers. Children will not learn how to behave as social beings if they are stuck in front of the TV for hours every day. They need their parents to show an interest in them and to spend time with them, helping them to play with their peers  and to learn the rules of social behavior. Children are now arriving at school socially undeveloped, increasingly unable to dress themselves, unable to use the toilet properly, unable to hold a knife and fork and unused to eating at a table, Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, writes in today's Observer. Instead of taking responsibility themselves, too many parents expect teachers to control their children's behaviour and wellbeing, she adds. Bousted says one mother blamed staff when she discovered that her 16-year-old son was smoking. We are in danger of becoming a nation of _ . The bedroom, once a place to sleep, has become the living space for the young. Spending hours in front of computer screens, on social networking sites or being immersed  in computer games, children and young people spend little time with their parents. Parents are unable to monitor just what their children are watching. Schools cannot right the wrongs of society and teachers cannot become substitute parents. Both parties need to work together. Parents must be helped and given confidence to take back control. They are responsible for setting boundaries for their children's behaviour and sticking to those boundaries. They are responsible for setting a good example to their children and for devoting that most precious of resources -- time -- so that children come to school ready and willing to learn.

      "question": "In the next five years, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) jobs are projected to grow twice as quickly as jobs in all other fields according to the U.S. Bureau of Statistics. While all jobs are expected to grow by 10.4 percent, STEM jobs are expected to increase by 21.4 percent. By this measure, future STEM jobs represent a huge opportunity to today's students. But, in fact, of the 3.8 million ninth graders in the U.S., only 233,000 end up choosing a STEM degree in college, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. This means only 6 percent of ninth graders will become STEM graduates. And of these graduates, women will be even more underrepresented in most STEM fields. These are alarming statistics. How do we get more young boys and girls to be interested in STEM-related fields? It isn't an easy task. Schools do not always adequately prepare students for these severe subjects, and college programs are designed to get rid of those who are less persistent. Nationally, only 41 percent of initial STEM majors who begin a degree in STEM-related fields complete their degree in less than six years. In addition, social pressures continue to cast a shadow over girls who might otherwise consider the STEM fields. A couple of years ago, I met amazing parents, both of whom had a background in engineering and hoped their 10-year-old daughter would follow in their footsteps. They encouraged her to take an after-school science / robotics program. When she got there, she found she was outnumbered 6:1 by boys in the class. As the only girl, she came home crying much of the time because she was teased and told that geeky girls are not welcome in the boys' club. Ironically, by the time young boys are entering college programs in STEM fields, many complain about the lack of girls. Starting at an early age, even as young as kindergarten, we need to encourage and help the next generation leaders to consider taking up science, computing, math and technology. We also need to realize that for young girls to be inspired to take and stick with this educational path and later career field, they will benefit from the support of the people that surround them: parents, teachers, friends and family members.

      "question": "Florence Nightingale was born in 1820. Growing up, she was a quiet and serious girl. She spent a lot of time playing with her dolls. She would pretend that the dolls were sick and she was their nurse. People would bring sick or hurt animals to her to look after. She even managed to mend a dog's broken leg when she was a young girl. She often went with her mother to visit the poor people. They took food and medicine to the sick. It was these visits that gave her the idea of becoming a nurse.      Florence really wanted to be a doctor but she couldn't because in those days only men were allowed to become doctors. She decided that she wanted to become a nurse. Her parents were very angry;the daughters of rich people did not work at all and certainly they did not become nurses. But Florence had made up her mind to specialize in nursing.      Her chance came in 1854 when Britain went to war with Russia in a place called the Crimea. Florence was asked to take a group of nurses to look after the sick and wounded soldiers. The hospitals were dirty, and there was not enough medicine. There were not enough beds, so some people were just lying on rags in the mud. There was so much sickness that the doctors could not treat all the soldiers. Florence and her team cleaned the hospital rooms and beds. They made sure that the soldiers got enough medicine. The army was unhappy because there were women so close to the fighting. They gave the nurses a lot of trouble. Florence and her team worked hard and got over all the difficulties they had to face.      Florence became famous as \"The Lady of the Lamp\". At night she would go from room to room checking on the patients. There was no electricity so she would carry an oil lamp with her to see where she was going. She often stayed to talk to the patients.      After the war, Florence returned to London as a national hero. A great welcome was prepared for her, but she slipped into the country unnoticed. She opened a school to teach nurses how to look after their patients properly. She never really got better from the illness that she had in the Crimea and she died in 1910.      Now Florence Nightingale is known as the mother of modem nursing. She had devoted her whole life to patients. It is because of her work that we receive the proper care in hospitals today.

      "question": "At 2 p.m. on December 5, 1945, five Navy aircraft took off in perfect flying weather from a naval air installation in southeastern Florida, on a routine training mission over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the flight commander radioed that he was \"completely lost\". Then there was silence. A rescue plane was sent to search for the missing aircraft, and it, too, disappeared. Despite one of history's most extensive search efforts, involving more than 300 planes and dozens of ships, the Navy found nothing, not even an oil stain floating on the water. This is just one of the many frightening stories told of \"the Bermuda Triangle\", a mysterious area of the Atlantic Ocean roughly stretching southwest from Bermuda to the Florida coast and down to Puerto Rico. During the past 30 years, the triangle has claimed the lives of some 1,000 sailors and pilots. Stranger yet are the numerous \"ghost\" ships that have been found floating crewless within the triangle. On one strange occasion in 1881, the cargo shipEllen Austindiscovered a small sailing ship, sails waving uselessly in the wind. The boat was full of wood with no one on deck. The captain of theEllen Austininstalled a new crew to sail it, but two days later, during a rough storm, the two ships temporarily lost sight of each other. When the captain again boarded the boat, he found his crew had disappeared. After a second crew was assigned, the ship was again lost in a fog bank. This time, no trace of the boat -- or the crew -- was ever found. Charles Berlitz, a man with an interest in Atlantis, the legendary lost island, puts forward his theory that a giant solar crystal, which once was the power generator for Atlantis, lies on the ocean floor. From time to time, according to his theory, passing ships and planes set off the crystal, which confuses their instruments and _ them into the ocean. Officially, the U.S. Navy does not recognize the triangle as a danger zone and is convinced that \"the majority of disappearances in the triangle can be due to the unique features of the area's environment.\" These include the swift Gulf Stream current and the unexplored valleys under water of the Atlantic. Also, the triangle is one of only two places on earth where a compass needle points to true north rather than magnetic north, causing problems in navigation. However, other scientists argue that beings from outer space have established a highly advanced civilization in the unexplored depths of the Atlantic inside the triangle. There, they believe, most of the missing vessels - and their crews - may still be on display for study by these higher intelligences.

      "question": "Television is a relatively stable advertising medium. In many ways, the television ads today are almost the same to those two decades ago. Most television ads still feature actors, still run 30 or 60 seconds, and still show a product. However, the different medium of the Internet causes unique challenges to advertisers, forcing them to adapt their practices and techniques. In the early days of Internet marketing, online advertisers used banner   and pop-up ads   to attract customers. These techniques reached large audiences, led to many sales leads, and came at a low cost. However, a small number of Internet users began to consider these advertising techniques annoying. Yet because marketing strategies relying heavily on banners and pop-ups produced results, companies invested growing amounts of money into purchasing these ad types. As consumers became more complicated, frustration with these online advertising techniques grew. Independent programmers began to develop tools that blocked banner and pop-up ads. A major development in online marketing came with the introduction of pay-per-click ads. Unlike banner or pop-up ads, which originally required companies to pay every time a website visitor saw an ad, pay-per-click ads allowed companies to pay only when an interested potential customer clicked on an ad. More importantly, however, these ads are not affected by the pop-up and banner blockers. As a result of these advantages and the incredible growth in the use of search engines, which provide excellent places for pay-per-click advertising, a great number of companies began turning to pay-per-click marketing. However, as with the banner and pop-up ads, pay-per-click ads came with their shortcomings. When companies began pouring billions of dollars into this emerging medium, online advertising specialists started to notice the presence of what would later be called click fraud  : representatives of a company with no interest in the product advertised by a competitor click on the competitor's ads simply to increase the marketing cost of the competitor. Click fraud grew so rapidly that marketers sought to diversify   their online positions away from pay-per-click marketing through new mediums. Although pay-per-click advertising remains a common and effective advertising tool, marketers adapted yet again to the changing elements of the Internet by adopting new techniques such as pay-per-performance advertising. As the pace of the Internet's evolution increases, it seems all the more likely that advertising successfully on the Internet will require a strategy that avoids constancy   and welcomes change. What is the main idea of the passage?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The pace of the Internet's evolution is increasing and will only increase in the future.",

      "question": "The latest fashion in the kitchen is the food steamer.All the stores are selling them;everyone wants one.Steaming is one of the simplest and healthiest ways of cooking food.However,that cooking time is usually longer than with other methods.In case you're thinking of buying a steamer,I've done a survey about the steamers available on the market to help you decide which will suit you best. Folding Steamer The simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel version. Advantages:This is a good,basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of  pans with the water under it;a ring in the centre allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean. Disadvantages:It only holds small dishes.Also,if you put too much water in the pan,it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery.If you put too little water in and let it get dry,you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables. Steaming Pan This is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled  steamers,which sits on the oven ring.The brand I bought is calledNutritious Living. Advantages:This is an excellent steamer, lightweight,easy to clean,and of all the steamers I've tried,this cooks the fastest.Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top.It's easier to store. Disadvantages:Water can boil away until the pan is dry,but if you make sure you fill the  pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food,this should not happen.You cannot  see the food cooking from the top.It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice. For serious users of steamers,I recommend having one of each version.If you just want  to try it,get the folding stainless-steel type. Which of the following is true about the folding steamers?",

      "question": "Are you a forgetful person? You might be able to blame your genes, a new study in the journal Neuroscience Letters suggests. Researchers from the University of Bonn have identified a variant  on the DRD2 gene that seems to be associated with increased forgetfulness. Everyone has one of two variants of the DRD2 gene, the difference is just one letter in the genetic code: Some people have the cytosine (C) variant, while others have the thymine (T) variant. The researchers wanted to see how having one variant over another was associated with forgetfulness. To test this, they analyzed the DRD2 gene of 500 study participants, and also had the participants answer surveys about their forgetfulness (such as how often they misplaced their keys, or forgot names). Most of the study participants--three quarters of them--had the thymine gene variant, while the other quarter had the cytosine gene variant. Researchers found an association between more forgetfulness problems and having the thymine gene variant of DRD2. Meanwhile, the cytosine gene variant seemed to have a protective effect against forgetfulness. However, \"there are things you can do to compensate for forgetfulness; writing yourself notes or making more of an effort to put your keys down in a specific location--and not just anywhere,\" study researcher Dr. Sebastian Markett, of the University of Bonn, said in a statement. Research has also suggested that some age groups are more forgetful than others. A recent national poll showed that millenials, who were born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, are actually more likely than seniors to be absent-minded with things like what day of the week it is, where they put their keys and remembering to bring their lunch.

Within 24 hours the reintroducing ended in failure, and the poor birds were back in cages, on their way to the safety of the Arizona reintroduction programme. Ever since then, the programme has enjoyed great success, mainly because the birds now being set free are Mexican birds illegally caught in the wild, confiscated   on arrival north of the border, and raised by their parents in the safety of the programme. The experience shows how little we know about the behaviour and psychology   of parrots, as Peter Bennett, a bird researcher, points out: \"Reintroducing species of high intelligence like parrots is a lot more difficult. People like parrots, always treating them as nothing more than pets or valuable 'collectables'.\" Now that many species of parrot are in immediate danger of dying out, biologists are working together to study the natural history and the behaviour of this family of birds. Last year was an important turning point: conservationists founded the World Parrot Trust, based at Hayle in Cornwall, to support research into both wild and caged birds. Research on parrots is vital for two reasons. First, as the Arizona programme showed, when reintroducing parrots to the wild, we need to be aware of what the birds must know if they are to survive in their natural home. We also need to learn more about the needs of parrots kept as pets, particularly as the Trust's campaign does not attempt to discourage the practice, but rather urges people who buy parrots as pets to choose birds raised by humans.

Looking at this, the lawyer suggested a dinner together, just three of them, wife thought, why not, since they are still going to be friends. At the dining table, there was a silence of awkwardness . The first dish was roasted chicken, immediately, the old man took the drumstick  for the old lady. \"Take this, it's your favorite.\" Looking at this, the lawyer thought maybe there's still a chance, but the wife was frowning when she answered. \"This is always the problem, you always think so highly of yourself, never thought about how I feel, don't you know that I hate drumsticks?\" Little did she know that, over the years, the husband had been trying all ways to please her, little did she know that drumsticks were the husband's favorite. Little did he know that she never thought he understood her at all, little did he know that she hated drumsticks even though all he wanted was the best for her.

I did not pay much attention to it at first. It felt that I had water in my ear. However, I began to hear less and less out of that ear. I even had to ask people to talk into my other ear so that I could hear them. I didn't realize how serious it was until late in the day  . One evening, when I was sitting on my bed doing chemistry homework, I fell off my bed. When trying to get up, I was incredibly dizzy  . I went to see a doctor and he told me that hearing loss was common. However, hearing loss is usually bilatera _ or occurs in both ears. He said that my hearing should come back within a week. After about a week the dizziness eventually went away, but the hearing loss did not. The medicine helped and I gained some of my hearing back. After many hearing tests, the doctor diagnosed   that I had permanent hearing loss in that ear. School became harder for me because I couldn't hear my teachers. I was very depressed. Finally, I bought a hearing aid. With the hearing aid, my hearing is almost back to normal. It makes school and group conversations easier. My friends, teachers and even complete strangers always ask me questions about hearing loss. I answer them patiently. I never get offended because I know this is new to them. I am delighted that I can teach them something new. What I have learned from this particular situation is that when things are desperate(;), there is always something good that can come out of it.

You can use a street map, or an online map search engine, to establish where in the city you will be staying and the distance you are from the major tourist attractions you want to visit. l Find a local provider of Transport for London tickets or travel cards, since your first bargain purchase will be an Oyster Card. Traveling around London with an Oyster Card will give you access to the cheapest option of transportation methods and the Oyster Card is accepted citywide on buses, boats and the London Underground, known by the locals as \"the tube\". l Seek out your nearest Tube Station. The Tube is the cheapest and most reliable form of transportation and runs from around 6 a.m. until around 1 a.m. ..., depending on the line or the station. There are 287 tube stations in London that accept the Oyster Card, with a high concentration in central London. If you are staying anywhere in central London, there will be a tube station less than 10 minutes away. The Transport for London website offers a tube station search facility to find the nearest subway station to any location in the city. When you find a tube station, you can easily locate the closest bus stop by using the comparison bus-tube maps at the station's entrance. l Follow the Transport for London Tube Guide to your destinations and always plan ahead.

      "question": "Most parents of kids under age 8 don't worry about how much time they spend watching TV or using other media, from computers to smart phones to tablets PCs, according to a new survey that found a child's use of media often reflects how much time parents spend in the similar way.  We generally found that media use is not a source of conflict in the home\" for families with young children, Ellen Wartella, a researcher from Northwestem University, told USA Today. She led a survey of 2,326 parents who have children 8 and younger.It found that in 80 percent of families, children's media use was not a problem, with 55 percent \"not too\" or\" not at all\"  concerned about it. It also showed parents have more positive than negative feelings about how media consumption affects a child's learning and the development of creativity.The exception is video games, which are viewed more negatively than TV, computers or mobile devices.\"Parents rated video games as more likely to have a negative effect on children's school performance, attention time, creativity, social skills, behavior and sleep than any other medium,\" the researchers said in a news conference about the survey.  The findings exposes a generational shift   in parental attitudes about technology's role in young children's lives,\" said Wartella.\"Today's parents grew up with technology as a central pact of their lives, so they think about it differently than earlier generations of parents, instead of a battle with kids on one side and parents on the other, the use of media and technology has become a family affair. \" The researchers identified three media environments created by parents: media-centric (39 percent of families) , media-moderate (45%)and media-light (16%). Children  in media-centric families spend at least three hours more each day watching TV or using computers, video games and tablet PCs don't make parenting easier.And 88 percent of parents say they are most likely to turn to toys or activities to keep their children occupied.Slightly fewer turn to books (79%) and TV(78%). The survey didn't look at how media affects children. That's a topic that the American Academy of Pediatrics has handled a number of times. The AAP says studies have found too much media use can lead to attention- problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders and being fat. In addition, the Internet and cell phones can provide platforms for illegal and risky behaviors. By limiting screen time and offering educational media and non-electronic formats  such as books, newspapers and board games, and watching television with their children, parents can help guide their children's media experience. Putting questionable content into context and teaching kids a700ut advertising contributes to their media literacy   ,\" it says. The pediatricians' group says parents should have \"screen-free zones\"  and TV should be turned off during dinner. At most, it recommends children and teens engage with entertainment media for no more than two hours a day and that should be high-quality content. It is important for kids to spend time on outdoor play, reading, hobbies  and  using their imaginations  in free  play.\" Kids  under 2 should not use television and other entertainment media because their brains are developing quickly and they learn best from direct human interaction,\" the group says. An article on screen time by t.he Mayo Clinic also notes problems linked t.o over screen time, including  being  fat, irregular  sleep , behavioral  problems , weak  school  performance , violence  and  less time for active and creative play.

      "question": "The world's largest solar thermal plant is set to begin producing power in the United States by the end of the year. Wind and energy from the sun are generally considered clean, unlike energy from coal-burning power stations. However, environmentalists now worry that too much solar power development could harm the local environment. A California company -- BrightSource Energy is building a huge solar power plant in the Mojave desert, about 60 kilometers southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. The plant is known as the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System. Joe Desmond works for the company. \"This is actually one of the highest concentrations of sunlight in the world, out here in Ivanpah.\" explained Desmond. BrightSource Energy will deploy 170,000 specially designed mirrors to direct solar energy towards boilers on top of three power towers. The steam produced in the boilers will drive turbine   to make electricity. Joe Desmond says the steam can reach temperatures of more than 260 degrees Celsius. \"We can store the sun's thermal energy in the form of molten salt, so we can produce electricity even when the sun goes down. There is a lot of interest in concentrating solar power around the globe in environmnents where you have lots of sun, such as China, South Africa, the Middle East, North Africa, explained Desmond. Environmentalists generally support the idea of solar power, however, many are concerned about the effect of power plants on sensitive environment. Lisa Belenky is a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, a private group. She says environmentalists are specifically worried about the effect of the Ivanpah Solar Project on the sensitive plant and animal life in that part of Mojave desert. \"Even though the desert seems big, when you start cutting it up, it can really affect how the species and the animals and the plants are able to survive in the long run,\"said Lisa Belenky. BrightSource Energy has already spent more than $ 50 million to move endangered desert tortoises away from the power plant. but Lisa Belenky says this is not the answer. \"We should be reusing areas that have a1ready been disturbed, like old mining sites, for example...either on homes, on businesses, parking lots.\" said Belenky. There have also been reports of birds dying at the Ivanpah Plant and others like it. Some birds die after colliding with solar equipment which the animals mistake for water. Other birds were killed or suffered burns after flying through the intense heat at the solar thermal plant.

Colouring, for example, varies according to what the producers are trying to sell. Health foods are packaged  in greens, yellows or browns because we think of these as healthy colours. Ice cream packets are often blue and expensive goods, like chocolates, are gold or silver.

Eventually, it came on the market in a dark blue and white package--blue because we think of it as safe, and white as calm. The size of a product can attract a shopper. But quite often a bottle doesn't contain as much as it appears to. It is believed that the better-known companies spend, on average, 70 percent of the total cost of the product itself on packaging!

The researchers, at the University of South Australia's Health and Use of Time Group, found that kids' nightly sleep time declined   by about three-quarters of a minute each year for the period they studied. My daughter was more likely to beg for a few more minutes of Angry Birds before bedtime.That means nowadays my daughter is sleeping about 50 minutes a night less than her grandfather who had to get up to milk the cows at 5:30 am. What hasn't changed is the predictions from health professionals on the consequences of lack of sleep. \"This is a sleepless age and more and more... we are turning night into day,\" one expert said in 1905. Back then, sleep was seen as a way to restore \"wearied brain tissue\". Children and \"clever\" children were thought to be most at risk, and most in need of energy-restoring sleep. The words may be different today, but the threats are pretty much the same. Parents are told that children risk mental and physical problems, and even obesity, if they don't get enough sleep. So the Australians looked to see how much sleep kids do need. The answer is the biggest surprise of this study--no one really knows. \"There is almost no exact evidence for proper sleep for children,\" the authors write. Their work was published in the journal Pediatrics. The author uses his daughter as an example     .",

      "question": "A town in Oxfordshire has become the first in the UK to have biomethane gas from human waste piped to their homes for gas central heating and cooking. Up to 200 families in Didcot now receive the gas via the national gas power system. Head of energy and technology at British Gas, Martin Orrill, said customers wouldn't notice any difference as the gas is purified to the highest standard and has no smell. The gas is produced at a sewage treatment works plant in Didcot. The entire process takes only less than three weeks, with the sewage being collected and sent first to settlement tanks. The solid waste material is then fed into digesters, where anaerobic bacteria digest the sewage, with the aid of enzymes to speed up the process. The digestion process produces methane, which can be burned to drive machines to produce electricity, or can be purified and fed into the gas network and piped to homes and businesses. British Gas says supplying the gas rather than electricity is far more efficient since around two-thirds of the energy is lost in producing electricity. Partners in the Didcot project, British Gas, Scotia Gas Networks, and Thames Water, all hope to expand the process to other towns, and other companies such as Ecotricity and United Utilities have also announced biomethane projects being planned. One of these projects, in Manchester, could be supplying 500 homes with biomethane by mid next year. Another British Gas project in Suffolk will provide gas from digestion of brewery wastes to around 235 families. The Didcot project cost PS2.5m and was influenced by promises of government aids aimed at encouraging companies to develop renewable technologies. An EU directive means the UK must ensure at least 15 percent of its energy is from renewable sources by 2020. The UK produces about 1.73 million tons of sewage annually. If all sewage treatment works in the UK were fitted with the technology, they could supply gas for up to 350,000 families. What should the text belong to?",

      "question": "To save yourself from embarrassment  , it's good to read a few books or research online about the culture and customs of the country you plan to visit. Clothing: Wearing shorts in public is generally not acceptable in most parts of the world, including some European countries. Greetings: Handshake is a usually accepted form of greeting, although in some countries, like Japan, a traditional bow  is preferred. Be careful how you talk with someone; don't use first names unless you are invited to do something. Language/Gestures: learn some polite expressions (hello-goodbye-thank you) and relax. English is pretty common worldwide, especially in tourist areas and you can always use body language to get your message across. However, some Americans gestures have different meanings in other countries. For example, in Bulgaria, shaking your head usually means  \"yes\"; shaking it \"vertically\" means \" no\". Food/Drink: you may find yourself looking down at a local delicious snake soup in china, sheep's eyes in Saudi Arabia... and wonder what to do; especially you are guests in someone's home. Be brave, take small bites, and pretend it tastes like something you like. Remember that some Buddhists don't eat beef, and Muslims don't eat pork. If you are eating with Muslims, never touch food with left hand (the left hand is for bathroom use). Conversations: if you know the history and culture of the country, you will be confident.

If you're unlucky enough to be stuck with classmates who don't really \"get\" you, you've just got to try to make the best of it. But that doesn't mean you need to \"fit in\", or at least in the way that people think. If you try to transform yourself into a clone of everyone else, it won't help you make friends. It'll just make you feel like a fake. You also shouldn't shut down or refuse to be friends with everyone who doesn't like you. If you do that, you'll just make yourself miserable. Instead, you've got to work on being comfortable and confident with whom you are while ignoring all the haters. Keep on speaking up, asking questions and getting to know people better. If you send out positive energy, then people will generally send some back to you. A couple of them will stay the same, and you're allowed to forget about them. If you feel like you're doing all that but still not getting anywhere, then don't give up. Just expand your circle. Get a part-time job at a cool-looking place, join an after-school art class or youth group--do whatever it takes to find a couple of like-minded people to connect with. Even if you don't find anyone right away, you'll still be getting some more social experiences under your belt, and that's always a good thing. A fun book called Uncool, by Erin Elisabeth Conley, has some tips for folks like you who want to stay positive at school while being true to your personality: *Throw caution to the wind. *Don't tolerate others' mistakes. *Have patience with people who are different from you. *Don't change just because someone else thinks you should. *Know that even though you may be a misfit, there's always some place where you will be welcomed in the world.

      "question": "Aggressive pedestrians are in fact as dangerous as careless drivers. They cause traffic accidents, injury and death. These dangerous walkers can be seen in any big city over the world. About 69% of last year's pedestrian deaths in the US occurred in urban areas. They cross streets ignoring \"DON'T WALK\" signals, suddenly appear without warning from behind parked vehicles, walk slowly at crossroads with cell phones attached to heads, blocking traffic. These pedestrians and drivers share a common disregard for the rules of the road, both for selfish reasons. The drivers believe in the power of their machines. If their machines can go faster, they believe they have the right to go faster. If their machines are bigger, they believe they have the right to push smaller vehicles aside. Aggressive pedestrians, on the other hand, believe in the primacy  of the individual, the idea that they are first in any environment, under any circumstances, even when they are on foot in a roaring tide of steel and rubber. Last year, an estimated 5,220 pedestrians died in traffic accidents. Some 69,000 pedestrians were injured. On average, that worked out to one pedestrian killed in a traffic crash every 101 minutes, and one injured every eight minutes. The good news is that the accident rate is dropping. For example, the number of pedestrians killed last year was 24 percent less than the number killed in traffic accidents a decade earlier. The bad news is that the basic causes of pedestrian deaths remain pretty much the same----disregard for traffic signals, inattention and crossing roads under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Alcohol, in fact, was involved in 46 percent of the traffic accidents that resulted in pedestrian deaths. Of those, 31 percent of the pedestrians were found to be drunk. The bottom line is that the pedestrians must do more to protect their lives as well as the lives of other road users. They can start by obeying traffic signals, using marked cross-walks and calling a cab when they've had too much to drink. What is the pedestrians' selfish reason for traffic jams?",

      "question": "My grandmother was a master gardener. She could make anything bloom  . Even me.  For most of her life, she lived on a farm in the mountains of North Carolina, where she raised four children, buried a husband, and watched the changing of the seasons. After my parents divorced , my dad moved back to the farm. I visited on weekends or holidays. While my dad ate my grandmother's vegetables, I breathed in her flowers. I was a skinny kid, but her flowers filled a thousand hungry places in my soul. When my regular farm tasks were done, I was free to climb the mountain, singing songs and gathering flowers. Sometimes the plants scratched   me. My grandmother would say: \"Beauty has a price. I hope it was worth it.\" \"Yes, ma'am,\" I'd say. \"It was.\" Then I'd scratch some more. I loved gathering flowers on my own. But what I loved best was gathering them with her. I walked behind her like a sponge   with legs, trying to soak   it all up. At the end of the day, we'd sort the flowers and make bouquets  : One for the living room, one for the kitchen, and three for the bedrooms. Even then, as a child, I knew what I needed most from my grandmother was not her flowers, but her time. She's been gone for years, but sometimes, when I reach down to pick a flower or pull a weed, I see her hand, not mine. I thought I'd grow up to be a gardener too. I told myself, someday, when my children had children, I'd be a gardening grandma. Then the grandbabies started showing up, and I discovered I'd much rather chase after them than go digging. The truth is, I'm no gardener. I'm a picker, not a planter. I differ from my grandmother in lots of ways, but this: I will always carry within me a heart she made from her own. They don't need to plant a garden. My children are my flowers. Delight and complete me with a beauty that is worth any price. All I need to do is care for them with time, water them with love, and hope that someday, when they hold their first grandchild, they might see my hand.

      "question": "For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted a personal motto. I wanted a saying that I could really try to live my life by. I mean all the humorous book and storybook heroes always have a personal principle they follow. Good manners! Courage! Keenness! But a part of me could never get myself to create my own motto because I never knew where to start and I never thought I could give one. \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" is a quote by the great writer and philosopher, Voltaire. More familiar, it makes an appearance in the modern day movie performance of the superhero Spider-Man. This saying provides a sense of responsibility for those with actually limitless power. \"Be good to others and others will be good to you.\" is another well-known proverb that has roots in almost all of the major religions. Although it is less practiced today than it is lectured, it is a powerful and good motto to live by. Kindness, in this sense, is the final power in judging every action. My personal motto today has an idea - being efficient. Through my limited knowledge, I have come to find that this is simply the best way for me to give insight about who I am and what I believe in. Efficiency is a quality that everyone desires for, right? Who doesn't want to be able to not only work fast but to achieve great results? To some, it may appear to be a frightening journey. But to me, it means that I have a lifelong journey to improve the methods and ideas with which I come near my tasks. Regardless of what motto you want to live by, I believe that everyone should have one, or two or more. These are all symbols of a perfect story of us, in our own view. And it immediately provides insight to the type of person we were, we are and what we strive to be. We are never meant to be perfect, but it is important to try and live by a belief that will help us reach our potential. All you have to do is know what your excitement is and live by it.

Surprisingly the study, by Cambridge University, found children as well as adults preferred to communicate face to face.More than half of all families said a \"technology-free\" time is important and a third of parents said technology had disrupted family life.The findings led family groups to warn that if parents end up spending more time checking emails and social networks than with their children, it could have a detrimental effect on the home.

Millions of animals die each year on US roads, the Federal Highway Administration reports. In fact, only about 80 ocelots , an endangered wild cat exist in the US today. The main reason? Road kill.    \"Ecopassages\" may help animals cross the road without being hit by cars. They are paths both over and under roads. \"These ecopassages can be extremely useful, so that wildlife can avoid human conflicts,\" said Jodi Hilty of the Wildlife Conservation Society. But do animals actually use the ecopassages? The answer is yes. Paul Beier of Northern Arizona University found foot marks left by mountain lions on an ecopassage that went under a highway. This showed that the lion used the passage.    Builders of some ecopassages try to make them look like a natural part of an area by planting trees on and around them. Animals seem  _ . Animals as different as salamanders  and grizzly bears are using the bridges and underpasses.    The next time you visit a park or drive through an area with a lot of wildlife, look around.

      "question": "Sensing phantom phone vibrations  is a strangely common experience. Around 80% of us have imagined a phone vibrating in our pockets when it's actually completely still. Almost 30% of us have also heard non-existent ringing. Are these signs of madness caused by digital culture? Not at all. In fact, phantom vibrations and ringing indicate a fundamental principle in psychology. Psychologists use a concept called Signal Detection Theory to guide their thinking about the problem of perceptual  judgments. Working through the example of phone vibrations, we can see how this theory explains why they are a common and unavoidable part of healthy mental function. When your phone is in your pocket, the world is in one of two possible states: the phone is either ringing or not. You also have two possible states of mind: the judgment that the phone is ringing, or the judgment that it isn't. Obviously you'd like to match these states in the correct way. True vibrations should go with \"it's ringing\", and no vibrations should go with \"it's not ringing\". Signal detection theory calls these faithful matches a \"hit\" and a \"correct rejection\" But there are two other possible combinations: you could mismatch true vibrations with \"it's not ringing\" (a \"miss\"); or mismatch the absence of vibrations with \"it's ringing\" (a \"false alarm\"). This second kind of mismatch is what's going on when you imagine a phantom phone vibration. What does that mean in terms of your phone? We can assume that people like to notice when their phone is ringing, and that most people hate missing a call. This means their perceptual systems have adjusted their bias  to a level that makes misses unlikely. The unavoidable cost is a raised likelihood of false alarms of phantom phone vibrations. The trade-off between false alarms and misses also explains why we all have to put up with fire alarms going off when there isn't a fire. It isn't that the alarms are badly designed, but rather that they are very sensible to smoke and heat and biased to avoid missing a real fire at all costs. The outcome is a rise in the number of false alarms. These are inconvenient, but nowhere near as inconvenient as burning to death in your bed or office. The alarms are designed to err on the side of caution. According to the writer, the sense of phantom phone vibration is_.",

They were more interested in my story of success, such as how I was able to create the nation's largest firm for millions of dollars. That's the story everyone wanted me to write, but it's not the story I wanted to tell. Looking back, I see so clearly how often, throughout my boyhood, I was touched by random acts of kindness that helped shape me into the man I am today. And random acts of violence and ignorance played just a powerful lawyer involves hard work, bur escaping generational poverty is the hardest thing I ever done. I chose to write the story of my childhood years in poverty, with the hope that a child somewhere in the world will read my story and be inspired to break the cycle of poverty.

      "question": "This year, the World Mental Health Day on Oct 10 was marked by the theme: \"Depression: A Global Crisis\". According to the World Federation for Mental Health and the WHO, depression has moved beyond the medical domain  to become a social problem. Statistics from the Beijing Suicide Research and Prevention Center show that of the 287,000 people who commit suicide in China every year, 70 percent are victims of depression. \"This equates to one depression victim taking their life every three minutes,\" cited CCTV recently. According to the Beijing-based Capital Medical University, the number of depression patients has been on the rise in the past years and now accounts for 5 to 10 percent of the population, more than the global average of 5 percent. Wang Shaoli, vice-president of Beijing Huilongguan Hospital, a medical center specializing in mental health, said that what makes depression so widespread is that everybody can get it. \"No one is immune to depression,\" said Wang. \"It has become a social problem because depression kills one's social capabilities, such as communication, and leads to a negative social mentality.\" According to Wang, depression can be treated with medicine and early psychological consultation. The real problem is the lack of awareness surrounding the issue. \"People with mental health illnesses are discriminated against,\" said Wang. \"So they are reluctant to go to hospital and often keep the pain to themselves, which only makes matters worse.\" Only one in 10 depression victims are properly treated in China, according to the Beijing Suicide Research and Prevention Center. \"When people get depressed, it becomes part of their thoughts, making them negative, even desperate,\" said Wang. \"And the ideas are difficult to change.\" That's why Wang suggests early intervention. \"Normally it takes about nine months to treat depression,\" said Wang. \"But in most cases, patients drop treatment half way when they feel some progress.\" According to the passage, which of the following are true EXCEPT  _   ?",

Anyone can start a blog, and they can write about anything they like. There are millions of blogs on the Internet today. They provide news, information and ideas to the people who read them.They contain links to other websites.And they provide a place for people to write their ideas and react to the ideas of others. A research company called Perseus has studied more than 3,000 web logs. It says that blogs are most popular with teenage girls. They use them to let their friends know what is happening in their lives. The study also says that more than 100,000 bloggers stopped taking part in the activity after a year. However, some people develop serious blogs to present political and other ideas. For example, the Republican and Democratic parties in the southern state of Kentucky recently started their own blogs.

      "question": "Do you have an emotional brain or a rational   one? Researchers at Australia's Monash University have found actual difference in the brains of people who respond emotionally to others' feelings compared with those who respond more rationally. A study published in the journal NeuroImage has looked at whether people who have more brain cells in certain areas of the brain are better at certain types of empathy, according to Science Daily. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person, and the two types investigated were cognitive   empathy and affective   empathy. \"Every day people use empathy with, and without, their knowledge to get around in the social world,\" said Robert Eres from Monash University's School of Psychological Sciences. \"We use it for communication, to build relationships, and to increase our understanding of others.\" \"People who are high on affective empathy are often those who get quite fearful when watching a scary movie, or start crying during a sad scene. Those who have high cognitive empathy are those who are more rational, for example a psychologist helping someone,\" explained Eres. The results of the study showed that people with high scores for affective empathy had more gray matter in a part of the brain called the insula, found right in the \"middle\" of the brain. Those who scored higher for cognitive empathy had more in a part called the midcingulate cortex--an area above the corpus callosum, which connects the two halves of the brain. The discovery \"raises new questions--like whether people could train themselves to have more empathy, and whether those areas of the brain would become larger if they did, or whether we can lose our ability to empathize if we don't use it enough\", according to Science Daily. \"In the future we want to investigate further by testing whether training people in empathy-related tasks can lead to changes in these brain areas. We also want to investigate if damage to these brain areas, as a result of a stroke   for example, can lead to empathy problems.\" said Eres. Perhaps in the future we will all be able to empathize more with other people. Maybe you will cry at that sad movie after all!

The message of this year's World Food Day is\"investing in agriculture for food security\".The F.A.O.says,\"During the early 1990s,the foreign aid for agriculture was nine thousand million dollars each year.But now, it has declined to less than five thousand million dollars a year.\"Yet, the F.A.O.estimates that more than eight hundred and fifty million people around the world do not get enough food. The UN agency notes that seventy percent of the world's hungry lies in the farmers who grow small amount of food.Many also face problems of feeding themselves.The F.A.O.says agricultural aid could help small farmers make a profit from their crops.Farmers would also be able to feed their families throughout the year and re-invest in their farms.They could buy better seeds,equipment and chemical fertilizers to help their crops grow. Muhammad Yunis.the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to improve the lives of poor people,as well as his Bangladesh microfinance organization,the Grameen Bank,has lent small amount of money to poor people who are unable to get traditional loans,especially women.Minister Yunis says that he plans to give his share of the one million three hundred thousand dollars Nobel award to good causes.He says he wants to establish an eye hospital and start a project to produce low-cost food for the poor.

      "question": "Blogging has become something of a big thing in the last few years. Just like the Internet was 10 years ago, blogging is popular with an underground culture, that is doing it for love and passion . Blogging is a way of collecting links  to webpages and sharing thoughts and ideas with people online. Blogs are basically online diaries which are created for sharing information and ideas. Dominic, a fifth-grade student, writes: \"The blogs give us a chance to communicate between ourselves and encourage us to write more. When we publish on our blog, people across the whole world can reply by using the 'comments' link. In this way, they can ask questions or simply tell us what they like. We can then know if people like what we write and this will tell us where we can improve. By reading these comments, we can discover our weaknesses and our strengths. Blogging is a chance to exchange our opinions with the rest of the world rather than just people in our immediate environment.\" Blogging is sweeping the Internet. A recent report states that at least three million Americans have created blogs, with similar numbers being seen worldwide. Two years ago, Andrew Sullivan decided to set up a Web page himself and used \"Blogger. com\" to publish some daily thoughts to a few hundred readers. He worked hard at the blog for months for no reward. But the result is that he is now reaching almost a quarter of a million readers a month and making a lot of money. This, at least, is the idea: a publishing revolution  is coming. \"Blogger.com\"  could be  to words what Napster was to music--except this time, it'll really work.

I also love my laptop computer ,as it holds all of my writing and thought .Despite this love of technology ,I know that there are times when I need to move away from these device and truly communication with others.On occasion ,I teach a course called History Matters for a group of higher education managers. My goals for the class include a full discussion of historical themes and ideas .Because I want students to thoroughly study the material and exchange their ideas with each other in the classroom ,I have a rule --no laptop ,ipads ,phones ,etc .When students were told my rule in advance of the class, some of them were not happy . Most students assume that year reasons for this rule include unpleasant experiences in the past with students misusing technology . There's a bit of truth to that.Some students assume that I am anti-technology . There's no truth in that at all . I love technology and try to keep up with it so I relate to my students. The real reason why I ask students to leave technology at the door is that I think there are very few places in which we can have deep conversions and truly complex ideas. Interruptions by technology often break concentration and allow for too much dependence on outside information for ideas . I want students to think differently and make connections between the course the material and the class discussion . I've been teaching my history class in this way for many years and the educations reflect student satisfaction with the environment that I create .Students realize that with deep conversation and challenge , they learn at a level that helps them keep the course material beyond the classroom . I'm not saying that I won't ever change my mind about technology use in my history class, but until I hear a really good reason for the change ,I'm sticking to my plan. a few hours of technology-free dialogue is just too give up. some of the students in the history class were unhappy with   _",

I asked my mom if Dad had gone to heaven. \"Yes, honey. Of course.\" she said.\"Can we write him a letter?\" She paused, the longest pause of my short life, and answered, \"Yes.\"My heart jumped. \"How? Does the mailman go there?\" I asked. \"No, but I have an idea.\" Mom drove to a party store and returned with a red balloon. I asked her what it was for.\"Just wait, honey. You'll see.\" Mom told me to write my letter. Eagerly, I got my favorite pen, and poured out my six - year - old heart in the form of blue ink. I wrote about my day, what I learned at school, how Mom was doing, and even about what happened in a story I had read. For a few minutes it was as if Dad were still alive. I gave the letter to Mom. She read it over, and a smile crossed her face.She made a hole in the corner of the letter where she looped the balloon string. We went out-side and she gave me the balloon. It was still raining.\"Okay, on the count of three, let go. One, two, three.\"The balloon, carrying my letter, darted upward against the rain. We watched until it was swallowed by the mass of clouds.Later I realized, like the balloon, that Dad had never let his sickness get him down. He was strong. No matter what he suffered, he'd persevere, dart up, and finally transcend this cold world and his sick body. He rose into sky and became something beautiful.

I'm a bit nervous as I've never made a speech before to so many people, so please forgive me if it shows! www.xkb1.com As we all know, this is the school leavers' party, and it's time to say goodbye to everyone. We're sorry to leave you at the end of our junior high school education, and we promise that we'll never forget the happy times we have spent in these buildings with you all. I'd like to thank three groups of people for the three things I've learnt while I've been a pupil at our school. The three things are friendship, love and knowledge. The first group is my friends, and what I've learnt is the importance of friendship. We've worked hard together, we've even shared some difficult times together, but we've also had a lot of fun. Many of us will go to new schools and we may not see each other so often in the future. Others will go on to senior high school and continue their close friendships. But friends don't have to see each other all the time. Sometimes the friends you treasure most are the friends you see less often. A life without old friends is like a day without sunshine. We'll always stay in touch. The second group is our parents and grandparents. We thank you for the love you have shown us during our years at junior high school, for making a home where we feel both safe and relaxed, and where we can prepare ourselves for our school days. We also thank you for your help with our homework. How many of us owe our good grades to the suggestions you have made during those long evenings? And finally, the third group is our teachers. We can never pay you back for your kindness, your patience, and gift of knowledge which you have offered us; sometimes you've made us work very hard. But you have always been fair and you'll always be our role models. There's a saying from Ireland which is a favourite of mine: Strangers are only friends you haven't met yet. I couldn't say it better myself. So from the bottom of my heart, I thank you all and wish you success for the future. Which words can you use to describe the tone?",

      "question": "Guide to Hiking on the Appalachian Trail How do I \"Leave No Trace   on the Appalachian Trail?\" At about 2,189 miles, the Appalachian Trail is the longest single unit of the National Park System. With the number of people visiting this place increasing each year, the chances are great that any of us may damage the natural environment along the Trail and affect the experience for others. So please do your part by following these hiking and camping practices, and encourage others to learn about and adopt these techniques. 1 Plan ahead and prepare. Evaluate the risks associated with your outing, identify campsites and destinations in advance, and use maps and guides. Prepare for extreme weather, dangers, and emergencies - especially the cold - to avoid impacts   from searches, rescues, and campfires. Learn when areas are most crowded and try to avoid those times. 2 Dispose of waste properly. Pack out all trash and food waste, including that left behind by others. Don't bury trash or food, and don't try to burn packaging materials in campfires. Use the privy   for human waste only. Do not add trash. If there is no privy, dispose of human waste by burying it in a hole, a hole at least 200 feet (80 steps) from campsites, water sources and shelters, and well away from trails. 3 Leave what you find. Leave plants, cultural artifacts   and other natural objects where you found them for others to enjoy. Do not damage live trees or plants; green wood burns poorly. Collect only firewood that is dead, down, and no larger than your wrist. Leave dead standing trees and dead limbs on standing trees for the wildlife. 4 Minimize campfire impacts. Use stoves for cooking - if you need a fire, build one only where it's legal and in an existing fire ring. Keep fires small. Never leave your campfire unattended, and drown it when you leave. Do not try to burn trash, including plastic, glass, cans, tea bags, food, or anything with food on it. These items do not burn thoroughly. They create harmful fumes  , and attract wildlife like skunks and bears. If you need a fire on the Appalachian Trail, you should   _  .",

      "question": "Marvin Minsky is often called the Father of Artificial Intelligence. His work helped inspire the creation of the personal computer and the Internet. Artificial Intelligence Before Minsky, computers were more like calculators, performing math operations at speeds much faster than humans. Minsky was the first to say that computers can one day be as intelligent as human beings. He was so convinced about this, that in 1959, he and his friend John McCarthy invented the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Minsky wrote a book called Perceptrons, describing a particular type of \"artificial neural  network\". Neural networks have made a comeback in a new field of Computer Science called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is used to recognize things and people in pictures (as seen in Facebook and Google Photos), language translation( try Google Translate sometimes), and so on. Robotics, Microscopes and Virtual Reality How many of you have done Robotics at school and loved it? You have Minsky to thank again, for his work on Robotics. One of his biggest inventions was the confocal scanning microscope, an instrument that is still widely used today in medical and scientific research. Minsky was really futuristic. He created one of the first head-mounted graphics displays , which gave rise to the exciting area of Virtual Reality. This year, Facebook is releasing Oculus, a virtual reality headset, which you can use to play games with your friends in a 3-D environment.

It can be used for patching up differences, apologizing, saying \"no,\" criticizing, getting the other fellow to do what you want without his losing face. For some jobs, it's the only tool that can succeed. It is a way to discuss subjects so sensitive that serious dialogue may start a quarrel. For example, many believe that comedians on television are doing more today for racial and religious tolerance than people in any other forum. Humor is often the best way to keep a small misunderstanding from escalating into a big deal. Recently a neighbor of mine had a squabble with his wife as she drove him to the airport. Airborne, he felt miserable, and he knew she did, too. Two hours after she returned home, she received a long-distance phone call. \"Person-to-person for Mrs. I. A.

Austerity was a fashion in England at the time, and she had asked her children to serve the meal. She knew that anything could happen--and it did, just as her son, with the studied concentration of a tightrope walker, brought in a large roast turkey. He successfully elbowed the swinging dining-room door, but the backswing threw the bird onto the dining-room floor. The boy stood rooted: guests stared at their plates. Moving only her head the hostess smiled at her son,\" No harm, Daniel,\" she said. \"Just pick him up and take him back to the kitchen\"... she enunciated clearly so he would think about what she was saying... \"and bring in the other one.\" A wink and a one-liner instantly changed the dinner from a red-faced embarrassment to a conspiracy of fun.

      "question": "When next year's crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they'll be joined by a new face: Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost  of Yale, who'll become Oxford's vice-chancellor----a position equal to university president in America. Hamilton isn't the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc. have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it's gone global. Yet the talent flow isn't universal. High-level personnel  tend to head in only one direction: outward from America. The chief reason is that American schools don't tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university's budget. \"We didn't do any global consideration,\" says Patricia Hayes, the board's chair. The board finally picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist  who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a particularlly American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity. Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student numbers. The decline in government support has made fund-raising an increasingly necessary ability among administrators  , and has hiring committees hungry for Americans. In the past few years, well-known schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen \"a major strengthening of Yale's financial position.\" Of course, fund-raising isn't the only skill outsiders offer. The globalization of education means more universities will be seeking heads with international experience of some kind to promote international programs and attract a global student body. Foreigners can offer a fresh perspective  on established practices. What is the current trend in higher education discussed in the passage?",

      "question": "Playing sports is a way for most kids to make friends, get exercise and have a good time. But what happens when kids have a disability preventing them joining in?     Challenge Alaska has worked out a national program to give those disabled kids a chance to enjoy the sports they otherwise may not be able to.     Alex thought a simple game of bocce ball   was out of reach before. Alex was hit by a car when he was 5 years old, an accident that left him with a broken body and a mind full of dreams. \"Those dreams are harder to do because you can't move your hands, and you can't move your legs,\" he said.          But today Alex was getting the chance to live his biggest dream. With some help, he can get the bocce ball across the playing field and he said he was getting the biggest joy from his favorite.      Today, Challenge Alaska worked together with another organization, the US Paralympics Academy  , to give kids with physical disabilities a chance to try some new sports.     \"They offer a lot of sports for people with disabilities and that's cool,\" Alex said.          But this program is not just about teaching these kids about sports. \"It's an opportunity to learn how to work on a team, how to work with other people, how to win graciously and how to lose graciously -- all about the lessons you can use throughout life,\" said Jeff Dick, leader of Alaska Paralympics Academy.         Challenge Alaska also has a program called Blaze Sports, which holds different events throughout the year. Dick says skills learned at these free programs increase kids chances of getting college scholarships   to play these sports. What is the biggest dream of Alex?",

      "question": "Henry Loomis served as director of the Voice of America for seven years starting in 1958.Mr Loomis played an important role in creating the Special English service . Henry Loomis was born in 1919 Tuxedo Park , New York. His father was Alfred Lee Loomis , a rich New York City businessman .In 1940, Henry Loomis dropped out of Harvard University to join the United States Navy .He was able to put to good use his knowledge of radar technology that he had learned about because of his father's work .After graduating at the top in his naval  training class, Henry Loomis became a teacher at the Navy's radar training school in Hawaii. By the end of World War Two, Henry Loomis had received many honors for his service, including a Bronze Star and an Air Medal. He left the Navy in 1946 to begin graduate studies. Henry Loomis later moved to Washington, D.C. to begin another part of his career in public service. He held positions in the Department of Defense and other agencies: In 1958, he became director of the Voice of America. During his travels around the world, Mr. Loomis saw that English was becoming an important international language. He believed that it was important to make English easier to understand by listeners of VOA broadcasts whose native language was not English. So Mr. Loomis asked VOA program manager Barry Zorthian to develop a way to broadcast to listeners with a limited knowledge of English: The result of this effort was Special English: The first Voice of America broadcast in Special English took place on October 19th, 1959. Those against his ideas at the time said the Special English method of broadcasting at a slower rate with a limited vocabulary would never work, it was not practical. American embassies  demanded that the program be called off. But Mr. Loomis supported the program. Soon, VOA began to receive hundreds of letters from listeners praising the program. Special English programs became some of the most popular on VOA. We are pleased to say that our programs still are. We can know from the passage that Henry Loomis  _  .",

      "question": "Deep in the wilderness of northern Kenya, two boys found a pair of crying cheetah cubs  . The cubs' mother had been killed by a lion. The cheetahs were only a few weeks old. In the wild, about 9 out of 10 cheetah cubs die before they are three months old. They are food for lions. But these cubs were so lucky that they were saved by their \"heroes\", who brought them to Jane and Ian Craig. The Craigs help save endangered animals at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The Craigs nursed the cheetah cubs back to health -- feeding them with bottles, sleeping with them, and comforting them. They named the cubs Sambu and Toki. But what would become of these cubs? How would they survive on their own? In the wild, cubs stay with their mothers until they are almost 2 years old. During that time, cheetah mothers teach their young how to hunt and how to protect themselves. The Craigs wouldn't be able to find a cheetah mother to teach the cubs. So they turned to a man named Simon King. King has spent more than twenty years studying cheetahs. He gave them a nod of approval when hearing about this, though taking care of two baby cubs would take a huge amount of time. For two years, he would need to have them at his side most of the time. But he felt there was no other choice. And so, when the brothers were one month old, King became their father. The brothers followed King everywhere. If they saw large dangerous and fierce mammals, King would growl at the cubs the way a mother cheetah would have, which was a signal for the cubs to stay away. They learned quickly. King taught the cheetahs to hunt using a toy rabbit as King pulled it around on a rope. With more lessons and training, the brothers began to hunt on their own. King is one proud father now.

      "question": "In a certain store where they sell puddings, a number of these delicious things are laid out in a row during the Christmas season. Here you may select the one which is most to your taste, and you are even allowed to sample them before coming to a decision. I have often wondered whether some people, who had no intention of making a purchase, would take advantage of this privilege. One day I asked this question of the shop girl, and I learned it was indeed the case. \"Now there's one old gentleman, for instance,\" she told me, \"he comes here almost every week and samples each one of the puddings, though he never buys anything, and I suspect he never will. I remember him from last year and the year before that, too. Well, let him come if he wants it, and welcome to it. And what's more, I hope there are a lot more stores where he can go and get his share. He looks as if he needed it all right, and I suppose they can afford it.\" She was still speaking when an elderly gentleman limped up to the counter and began looking closely at the row of puddings with great interest. \"Why, that's the very gentleman I've been telling you about,\" whispered the shop girl. \"Just watch him now.\" And then turning to him: \"Would you like to sample them, sir? Here's a spoon for you to use. \"The elderly gentleman, who was poorly but neatly dressed, accepted the spoon and began eagerly to sample one after another of the puddings, only breaking off occasionally to wipe his red eyes with a large torn handkerchief. \"This is quite good\". \"This is not bad either, but a little too heavy\". All the time it was quite evident that he sincerely believed that he might eventually buy one of these puddings, and I am positive that he did not for a moment feel that he was in any way cheating the store. Poor old chap! Probably he had come down in the world and this sampling was all that was left him from the time when he could afford to come and select his favorite pudding. Amidst the crowd of happy, prosperous looking Christmas shoppers, the little black figure of the old man seemed pitiful and out of place, and in a burst of benevolence, I went up to him and said: \"Pardon me, sir, will you do me a favor? Let me purchase you one of these puddings. It would give me such pleasure.\" He jumped back as if he had been stung, and the blood rushed into his wrinkled face. \"Excuse me,\" he said, with more dignity than I would have thought possible considering his appearance, \"I do not believe I have the pleasure of knowing you. Undoubtedly you have mistaken me for someone else.\" And with a quick decision he turned to the shop girl and said in a loud voice, \"Kindly pack me up this one here. I will take it with me.\" He pointed at one of the largest and most expensive of the puddings. The girl took down the pudding from its stand and started to make a parcel of it, While he pulled out a worn little black pocketbook and began counting out shillings and pennies on to the counter. To save his \"honor\", he had been forced into a purchase which he could not possibly afford. How I longed for the power to unsay my tactless words! It was too late though, and I felt that the kindest thing I could do now would be walk away. \"You pay at the desk,\" the shop girl was telling him, but he did not seem to understand and kept trying to put the coins into her hand.

      "question": "The prestigious   Peking University and Tsinghua University held graduation ceremonies on the same day this year. The presidents of the two universities delivered excellent speeches at the ceremonies as they used words, phrases or ways of expression that are very popular on the Internet currently. At the same time, graduation speeches by other university presidents were also under the spotlight for the same reason. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by students as they contained many fashionable words today, such as \"floating clouds\" ( meaning \"too small and of little importance to mention\") and \"gelivable\" (meaning \" very helpful\") . In the speeches , these university presidents recalled campus life together with students and finally moved all the audiences. They were very different from the usual run of lectures. Many university presidents have changed their regular manner of addressing graduation ceremonies from an advising and preaching   mode to a more fashionable and funny approach. They try to use those words popular among young people in their speeches. In the past, university presidents' speeches were criticized for being too standard and lacking sentiment. Now , they quote fashionable words in their addresses, reflecting they are starting to adopt more everyday attitudes to students. The use of these new expressions has _ a heated discussion. It focuses on the question of whether university presidents should speak in an informal way at graduation ceremonies. Supporters agree with the new approach. They consider it good to build close ties with students by using the youth's own words.

Meanwhile,some safety tips should be followed,enjoying the happiness and excitement the beach offers. The number l safety tip concerns ocean safety:pay attention to Flag conditions posted on the lifeguard stands.Lifeguards post a red flag to warn when the ocean water is dangerous.Take them seriously! Tourists from land-locked regions are particularly easily attracted by the magic of the waves.However,a calm ocean can become risky without warning.Make sure you swim near a lifeguard.Swimming without lifeguard protection is almost five times as great as drowning at a beach with lifeguards. Never swim alone.Many drownings involve single swimmers.When you swim with someone else,if one of you has a problem,the other may be able to get help,including signaling for assistance from others. Don't fight the current.The facts show that some 80% of rescues by lifeguards at ocean beaches are caused by currents.These currents are formed by surf and gravity,because once surf pushes water up the slope of a beach,gravity pulls it back.This can create concentrated rivers of water moving offshore.If you are caught in a rip current,don't fight it by trying to swim directly to shore.Instead,swim parallel to shore until you feel the current relax,then swim to shore.Most rip currents are narrow and a short swim parallel to shore will help bring you to safety.

      "question": "At the Presbyterian Church in downtown Harare, Zimbabwe, 15-year-old Lovemore and other children crowd around tables in a small room, answering questions in their workbooks. Their uniforms are clean and worn with pride, and in many ways it would be difficult to distinguish this classroom from any other. These children, like Lovemore, live at the Mbare bus station, a crowded, dirty and dangerous place for anyone, especially at night. Lovemore said that he started to face problems once his mother died and his father stopped paying school fees. When Lovemore's father remarried, Lovemore was forced onto the street, no longer welcome at home. After meeting a worker from the Presbyterian Children's Club (PCC), Lovemore felt encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to get an education. Since joining the program, he is always at the top of his class. He spends his mornings at the PCC, where he receives his only meals for the day. At night, he sleeps on the ground at the bus station. The few clothes he owns are hidden in secret places around town so that no one will steal them. At the end of each day, Lovemore and his classmates take their books with them to study at night in the market square. \"We read by the street lights, but sometimes the guards drive us away.\" Each year, the top three students are given a chance to go to formal school. Those who successfully complete their grade-seven exams will be given a PCC scholarship to attend a boarding school , proving there is hope for forgotten children like Lovemore. Started in 1996, the program provides free education, basic meals, health care and clothing to more than 70 children. \"There are people who care here, and other kids like me,\" Lovemore said. \"It feels like this is my family.\" Lovemore began to live on the streets   _  .",

She complained about her son when she went towards her son's bedroom. The six-year-old boy was staying with fear in the cupboard when he heard what his mother said. He knew she got really angry this time. The woman pushed the door open with a loud noise. But when she saw the words and pictures on the wall, her anger soon disappeared. \"I love you, mum!\" covered the whole wall, with so many hearts around them, and so many stars in the sky.

Chief Joseph did not want to leave the land. It was holy ground. It contained the bones of his father and mother. But,like his father in earlier times,Chief Joseph knew it would be hopeless to stay and defend the land. There were too few Indians to win a war against the white men. And so in June of eighteen seventy-seven,the Nez Perce left their home in the Wallowa Valley. They left quickly. They were able to take only a small part of what they owned,and just a few cattle and Appaloosa horses. When the Indians reached the Snake River,the water was very deep and ran very fast with melted snow from the mountains. Chief Joseph and his people made boats from sticks and dried animal skins to cross the river. While the Indians were busy,a group of white men came and stole some of the cattle waiting at the edge of the river. The other chiefs demanded that Joseph call a meeting. Two of the chiefs,White Bird and Toohoolhoolzote,spoke for War,but Joseph held different opinion. Some of the young men in White Bird's group were very angry. That night,they rode into the countryside and killed eleven white persons. During all his years as chief,Joseph had tried to keep the peace. Now he saw there was no hope. Although he and his young men had taken no part in the killings,he knew that the white men would blame all of the Indians. Chief Joseph said,\"I would have given my own life if I could have undone the killing of the white men.\" Many Nez Perce fled. Chief Joseph remained,because his wife was about to have a baby. After she gave birth,he and his family joined the others in White Bird Canyon to the south. Joseph wanted to lead the people to safety in the flat lands of Montana. But the United States army quickly sent horse soldiers to follow them. They were extremely tired when they reached White Bird Canyon. An Indian--carrying a white flag--walked forward to meet them.

But the injury led her to t'ai chi when Oliver saw a poster for a t'ai chi class and decided to try the mysterious Chinese sport.\"I was active and could not bear resting in bed and I thought I had to find some way to recover,\"she recalls. She was struck by the beautiful movements and the\"nice, patient instructor--Nelson\", who later became her husband. The couple opened a t'ai chi school in the UK. But they soon found themselves in a bottleneck. So the couple decided to move to China. They taught English in universities and learned t'ai chi under various masters. After years of practice, Oliver found her occasional backaches had disappeared. But three years after moving to China to pursue their dream, Nelson died, bringing her much pain. She thought of quitting, but considering the career in which her husband took pride, she stuck to it. She says her t'ai chi\"family\"-- the masters and students -- also provided great support, including her then tutor Dong Bing. She speaks of their first meeting:\"I had been told that his skill was of a very high level and for some reason I had a mental image of a powerful, big man. But my fellow pointed to a small, thin old gentleman, sitting on the ground. Then a sudden feeling of pleasure hit me. Of course this was exactly the kind of person who would be a t'ai chi master -- the last person you could imagine. His idea is that one should not pursue wealth and fame but should endeavor to be happy and share one's knowledge and wisdom with others.\" Following the master, Oliver now learns to live a simple life -- one perhaps more traditional than many Chinese.

      "question": "Dr. Glenn Tisman, a cancer specialist, knew his young neighbor, Ray Bateman, had an unusual mind. But he had no idea at the time that 12 - year - old Ray had the ability to become his partner in cancer research. Ray's parents remembered that at age four, Ray surprised them by fixing a broken vacuum cleaner . When he was ten, he speedily constructed the family color television from a kit. Later, he succeeded in assembling  a complex stereo system after two experts had failed to do the job. When Ray was ten, he convinced his parents to buy him a computer. In a short time, Ray was able to do amazing things with the computer. Ray shared his enthusiasm for computers with Dr. Tisman, who used a computer for his research. The two discussed computers and medicine frequently. Amazingly, Ray understood the biology and chemistry related to Dr. Tisman's medical research without any previous instruction. Ray then worked with Dr. Tisman after school. He helped conduct research with the equipment and kept it in working order. The purpose of the research was to test the effectiveness of mixing an old cancer drug with certain vitamins. Ray analyzed patient test results by computer, while Dr. Tisman handled all patient contact. Together, they came up with solid research that helped advance cancer treatment. In 1988, 14 - year - old Ray went with Dr. Tisman to a meeting of the American Federation for Clinical Research(AFCR), where Ray presented their initial research findings. Using terminology  beyond the grasp of most kids his age, Ray told the scientists how the new drug mixture caused fewer and milder side effects for cancer patients. A year later, Ray returned to the meeting to update the findings of his and Dr. Tisman's research. By then, he had become well - known for his devotion to finding cures for sick patients. Stories about him appeared in hundred of newspapers around the world. He appeared on television newscasts and talk shows. Ray continued to spend most free hours working with Dr. Tisman.

      "question": "As more people use smart phones to pay bills and store personal information, strict password security has become more important than ever. A new study shows that free - form gestures - sweeping fingers in shapes across the screen of a smart phone--can be used to unlock phones. These gestures are less likely to be observed and reproduced by others than traditional typed passwords. \"All that it takes to steal a password is a quick eye,\" said one of the researchers of the study. \"With all the personal information we have on our phones today, improving their security is becoming increasingly necessary.\" In developing a secure solution to this problem, the researchers studied the practicality of using free - form gestures. With the ability to create any shape in any size and location on the screen, the gestures were popular as passwords. Since users create them without following a template, the researchers predicted these gestures would allow for greater complexity. The researchers carried out a create - test - retest experiment where 63 people were asked to create a gesture, recall it, and recall it again 10 days later. The gestures were captured on a recognizer system designed by the team. Using this data, they tested the complexity and accuracy of each gesture using information theory. The result of their analysis is that people are favorable to use free - form gestures as passwords. To put their analysis into practice, the researchers then had seven students in computer science and engineering, each with considerable experience with touchscreens , attempt to steal a free - form gesture password by observing a phone user secretly. None of them were able to copy the gestures with enough accuracy. The gestures appear to be extremely powerful against attacks. Though the testing is in its early stage and widespread adaptation of this technology is not yet clear, the research team plans to continue to analyze the security and management of free - form passwords in the future. They believe this is the first study to explore free - form gestures as passwords. They will soon publish their findings. The main purpose of the text is to   _  .",

SocialNetworking  Sites: Sites like MySpace and Facebook _ all generations and are a good way for a parent to understand what social standards your teen is living with.

MMORPG: Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game comes in the form of games. A child can easily become addicted to   them if no limits are set. To fully understand the attraction behind MMORPG, you can make your own account and character to explore the digital   world. Playing the online games may seem strange at first to your teen, but experience has led me to only positive feedback   from young people who can communicate with adults about their gaming experiences. Text and Instant Messenger: The ways of teenage communication have produced a whole new language, such as \"LOLZ\" (laughing out loud) and \"PSOS\" (parent standing over shoulder). Learning the basic shorthand   of teens can open up a whole new world of communication, not only talking to your teens, but being able to listen on their terms as well.

      "question": "Below is a housing guide for students going to London. University accommodation  offices Many university accommodation offices have their own list of registered landlords  . Others also provide information on accommodation agencies and other housing organizations. The advantage of using your university accommodation office is that you can get some support if you have a problem. The disadvantage is that they are unlikely to have enough registered landlords to houses all their students. Property papers: Loot and Renting Loot is an important source   of information about private housing for co-renters. The offers are from private landlords, agencies and individuals looking for other co-renters. They also have a website: www.loot.com. The advantage of using Loot is that there are some excellent bargains. The disadvantage is that there is no quality control over the offers. Renting is another useful paper. The offers in this paper are mainly from accommodation agencies. Their website is at www.renting.co.uk. Accommodation agencies The majority of rented accommodation in London is probably advertised through accommodation agencies. The advantage of using accommodation agencies is that: you will have access to a large number of accommodations. A good agent will listen to your requirements and can save you time in looking for the right accommodation. The disadvantage is that they will make a range of charges to potential renters. Noticeboards Around the universities you will find a number of noticeboards where offers of accommodation will be posted. These will either be from landlords or from students. Some universities will also have online noticeboards where students can advertise to other students. Advertisements from students can be an excellent way to find accommodation. However, advertisements from landlords can be problematic. Word of mouth Some of the best housing in London is never advertised but is passed on from one group of students to another by word of mouth. It might be that you can find out about good offers from final year students. However, don't suppose that just because you have found out about housing from a friend it is necessarily going to be better than that found through any other source.

It is always polite to let guests or elderly people at the table taste every dish first. But in the West, everyone has his or her own plate of food. Although there are no strict rules on how to set chopsticks and spoons, there are some things you should never do during a Chinese banquet  . Firstly and most importantly, don't put your chopsticks upright in the rice bowl. Instead, lay them on your dish. The reason for this is that when people die, family members give them a bowl full of rice with a pair of chopsticks sticking out upright in it. So if you stick your chopsticks in the rice bowl, it appears that you want someone at the table to die. Make sure the spout  of the teapot is not facing anyone, as this is impolite. The spout should always be directed to where nobody is sitting, usually just outward from the table. Don't tap on your bowl with your chopsticks. Beggars tap on their bowls, so this is not polite.

Principal Waynes Kettler said he's worked with many outstanding teachers in his 22 years as an educator, but Peterson is \"just that one step above anybody I've ever worked with before.\"   Kettler and others at Monte Cristo Elementary School talk about the ways she has introduced the learning from other classrooms into her music program and her creativity in working around things such as the lack of money for new music.  When students were reading S.E. Hinton's novel The Outsiders in their regular classroom, Peterson helped them write a 30-minute play with scenes from the book. Then they chose three Broadway tunes that focused on race, equality and social justice, the themes of the book. Peterson composed two other songs herself after classroom discussions about the play and the book. The honor means a lot to residents of Granite Foils. It's inspiring to know that people from small towns even win national honors. As national teacher of the year, Peterson will spend the more years outside the classroom, as a national and international spokeswoman for education. She said it's essential for schools to offer classes such as art or music and physical education because for some kids one of those subjects is the only thing that attracts them to come back to school day after day. Which of the following is an example of Peterson's way of teaching music?",

      "question": "In the last few years, some researchers have decided to study why kids lie ,So they made up a special team of 12 students, all under the age of 21. Each student was given 36 cards, and each card listed a topic that teens sometimes lie about to their parents, The researchers worked through the cards with the teens, learning what things the kid was lying to his parents about, and why. By the end of the interviews, the kids saw for the first time how much they were lying and how many of family's rules they had broken. It was reported that 98% of the teens had lied to their parents. Out of the 36 topics, the average  teen was lying to his parents about 12 of them. The teens lied about what movie they went to, and whom they went with .They lied about how they spent their afternoons while their parents were at work, and something like that. Most parents hear their child lie and think he's too young to understand what lies are or that lying is wrong. They believe their child will stop when he gets older. Many books also advise parents to just let lies go -- they'll grow out of it. But the truth is that kids grow into it. In studies where children are observed  in their natural environment, a 4-year-old child will lie once every two hours, while a 6-year-old child will lie about once every hour and a half.

      "question": "Many of today's parents fondly remember childhood days spent playing outdoors. When children make mud pies and observe ants, it may seem like just fun and games, but the truth is the outdoor play is an important part of growing up healthily. The National Association for the Education of Young Children reports that outdoor play reduces (make...less) stress and restlessness in children and improves their attention. Outdoor play is the perfect way to fight against the childhood's obesity(being fat).Research shows that children who play outdoors are more fit and thin, according to the National Center for Physical Development and Outdoor Play. Children who spend time outside on a regular basis  also have healthier immune   systems. And playing outdoors is a good way to get enough vitamin D. Playing outside enables children to relax , reduces tension and helps them solve problems. When children play outdoors, they learn to share and cooperate (work together) with one another. Kids who feel confident outdoors are likely to become able clever adults. The outdoors is a giant laboratory for learning that improves creative thinking and problem solving. Researchers have found that children learn best when their body, mind and spirit are involved  , and this appears in outdoor play. Outside activities develop all five senses, which create a powerful learning environment. The outdoors also lets children have the chance to explore  , experiment, form questions and create their own ideas about how the world works. Although there are the many advantages of outdoor play, time spent outside has been reduced for many of today's children. Kids today spend much more time in front of electronic media than children a generation   ago. The lack of outdoor play is tied to the childhood widespread obesity. And experts predict that the situation is so serious that this generation will have much trouble when they grow up. To get kids involved with the outdoors, encourage them to collect rocks, fly kites, climb trees, garden, camp, swim, go fishing, watch birds and butterflies or play games with other children.

      "question": "Nowadays the U.S. students are sleepy in school because they spend too much time texting, playing video games, watching TV and using the media in other ways. \"Heavy media use interferes with sleep by reducing sleep duration, making it harder to fall asleep, and lowering sleep quality,\" Meilan Zhang, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, wrote in her research review in the journal, Sleep Medicine. But the relationship between youth's media use and sleep is not so simple, said Michael Gradisar, who authored both that review and the Sleep Medicine meta-analysis. \"Technology use is the new evidence when we are trying to answer 'Why are school-age children sleeping less?'\" said Mr. Gradisar, an associate professor of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. There may be safe limits to technology use, Mr. Gradisar stated. For instance, recent research results indicate that using a bright screen for an hour before bed or even playing violent video games for less than that will not necessarily interfere with teenagers' sleep, he wrote. But longer periods of usage can be harmful to sleep, Mr. Gradisar added. Rather than delaying school start times, he said, the first step should be educating parents about limiting the hours that their children are using technology before bed, and enforcing a consistent bedtime. Early school start times are also commonly blamed for students' sleepiness, especially for adolescents. Secondary schools around the nation and the world have been delaying start times, often with positive results. Mr. Minnich of the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center hesitated to put blame to any particular factor. But he did think that cost-saving measures to consolidate bus routes might help explain U.S. students' sleepiness. \"For those children who board the bus first, they must get up earlier, may end up sleeping on the way to school, and may end up arriving at school sleepy.\" he said.

I paid 50 yuan for my colorful shirt from a street vendor in Beijing. Of course my shirt was a knockoff, a cheap copy of the brand. After a few washes, little balls formed on the surface of the thin material. Do I care? Not at all. You get what you pay for. I have to admit I hate shopping. _ I have other priorities.

      "question": "No opera smells of the sea quite like Britten's Peter Grimes. The music makes us constantly aware of the sea's immensity, it's potential for threat, and the play of light on its waves. But the sea isn't just a special background, it weighs on the lives of the characters, offering them a living, but at a price. In the first act the laboured sound of the strings evokes   the complete heaviness of the sailor's work, as they haul  the boats up the shingle  . Then a storm gathers which rages  through the scene at the Inn, and stirs up an orchestral hurricane. Even when it's calm and favorable, the sea is inescapable. In the comfortable enclosed world of the opera house, this can only be suggested. In the production of Peter Grimes about to open at the Aldeburgh Festival, it will be really present, because the opera is taking place on the beach, the setting for much of the narrative of Britten's opera, and also the poem by the Suffolk poet George Crabbe that inspired it. This won't be the first opera production to be set in the actual landscape in which the action takes place. There's a well-known filmed production of Tosca shot in Castel Gandolfo in Rome, and a production of Donizetti's Anna Bolena was once mounted in the moat  surrounding the Tower of London. But those were manageable urban landscapes, with comfortingly solid buildings to act as wind shields and acoustic blocks. On the Aldeburgh beach there's actually nothing, apart from a few boats, some whole, some wrecked. Here anything more complicated than walking the dog is hard to solve. The wind blows away one's words, so conversation is hard, and anything not tied down tends to blow away. The sliding shingle turns one's steps into a drunken stagger. The idea of performing an opera in these conditions seems quite _ -- an accusation Aldeburgh director Jonathan Reakie takes cheerfully on the chin. Why has he done it? \"Well, Grimes is the opera of Britten's that's most associated with Aldeburgh, but it's never been produced at the Festival which he founded. There just isn't the space for it. In his anniversary year we wanted to focus on Britten's connection with Suffolk, and this seemed the boldest way to do it.\" Having had the mad idea, Reakie found his colleagues were not just accepting, but enthusiastic. \"We spent a long time thinking about ways to do it. One idea we had was to do all the scenes at the right time of day. There's one scene at dawn, another at midday, and a lot of action at night, but that was too complicated. Then we thought about doing a few scenes on the beach. But in the end, we thought hell, let's just do the whole thing.\" Reakie's partners' attitude towards his opera on a beach is   _  .",

More than hard work or education, the best way to get rich in America is to be born rich. It is the case that somebody who is in the upper third of income, poor scores, in the bottom on tests when they are in eighth grade, is more likely to go to college and finish college than a poor kid with the top scores.

That's about 200 years. The hallmark   of American opportunity has always been the ability to do better than your parents. But compared with similar developed countries, the United States ranks fifth out of six for so-called intergenerational mobility  . If you look at the mechanisms   for upward mobility that were so readily available 50 years ago, they are becoming out of reach, like plentiful factory jobs with good wages and affordable education and health care. White families are twice as likely as blacks to be upwardly mobile. For most people in America today, _  If you started in the middle-income class, about 40 to 45 percent of what you are making right now is due to the fact that your parents were in the middle-income class.

There were fears that the items may have contained the cancer-causing coloring Sudan I.Do you have any desire to take the food provider to court because it feeds you something dangerous? After all,the law supposedly gives people the right to fight for their rights.But some experts have said it might not be so wise to take the company directly to court. Qiu Baochang,a lawyer in Beijing,suggested that consumers not take the company directly to court.\"In addition to the high costs,consumers'complaints are unlikely to win unless they can prove they have had the banned dye at KFC,\"--Qiu explained. One problem for those wanting to take action against the fast food chain is that few customers ask for or keep receipts .And,this must be the first step. If they can prove that their health has been damaged by KFC,they can cue the company.But that would be almost impossible to do so because the Sudan I damage is a long-term effect and is not immediately apparent.

To be sure, you can apply various priority   classes and groupings using SaneBox. What really makes SaneBox worth checking out is its ability to ensure unimportant and low-priority emails don't take up even a second of your day. When you apply SaneBox to your email client  , it spends a good deal of time scanning your entire inbox, including ones you've already read. This helps the add-on determine which emails are most important to you. From then on you'll only see emails that SaneBox determines are must-reads, with all others falling into a \"Later\" folder which you can read at your spare time. Each day --- or however often you want it --- SaneBox will produce a report of all the low-priority emails it has collected for you, like a secretary gathering all the odds and ends for a short daily report. If you find an important email has been flagged as low-priority, you can adjust the settings so it never happens again. SaneBox works with all IMAP, WebDAV and OWA email customers including Yahoo, Gmail, AOL, MS Exchange and others. The program also supports OS X's Mail customers, though it requires a bit of adjusting POP-only email services are not supported.

With his great musical talent, this 17-year-old boy has become a superstar in the music industry. Justin Bieber was born in Straford, Ontario and was raised by his single mother. Bieber learned to play musical instruments when he was very young. In 2007,he took part in a local singing competition in his hometown, and he did it just for fun. He never took singing lessons before but surprisingly he placed second in the competition. Then,with the help of his mother, he uploaded videos of him singing on a website and they successfully attracted the attention of viewers. His videos got popular through word of mouth and some of them have received up to 10,000,000 views. Justin Bieber would have never gotten a career in the music business without his videos.

      "question": "Psychologists  have known that what's going on inside our head affects our senses. For example, poorer children think coins are larger than they are, and hungry people think pictures of food are brighter. Professor Remi Radel wanted to investigate(look into) how this happens -- whether it's right away, as the brain receives signals from the eyes, or a little later, as the brain's higher-level thinking processes get involved. Radel chose 42 students and each student was told to arrive at the lab at noon after three or four hours of not eating on the day of the test. Then they were told there was a delay. Some were told to come back in 10 minutes; others were given an hour to get lunch. So half the students were hungry when they did the experiment and the other half had just eaten. For the experiment, the participant looked at a computer screen. One by one, 80 words flashed on the screen. A quarter of the words were food-related. After each word, the person was asked how bright the word was and asked to choose which of two words they'd seen -- a food-related word like gateau (cake) or a neutral   word like bateau (boat). Hungry people saw the food-related words as brighter and were better at identifying food-related words. Because the word appeared too quickly for them to be reliably seen, this means that the difference is in perception  , Radel says--it's not because of some kind of processing happening in the brain after you've already figured out what you're looking at. \"This is something great to me, that humans can really realize what they need or what they hope for, to know that our brain can really arrange for our motives and needs,\" Radel says. \"There is something inside us that selects information in the world to make life easier.\" The purpose of Radel's research is to let us know    _   .",

Men and women in France are seeking relief using the world's best medicine-----laughter. In the past year, more than 15 laughter clubs have been set up across the country. People of all ages go to release their stress with an hour group laughs. \"People telephoned me and said they have forgotten what it is to laugh. They want to find a place where they can escape all their problems for a while. So they come,\" said 40--year--old Jocelyne Le Moan. She usually takes a class of around 60 people through a series of laughter techniques. Her pupils range from teenagers to 70 years old, but most are middle---aged white collars seeking 60 minutes of relaxation at the end of a busy day. Le Moan takes them through the \"Lion Laugh\"and the \"Laugh Contest\", where participants \"speak\"to each other in different ways. And instead of talking, they break into fits of laughter. At the end there are 15 minutes of \"meditation\", when they lie on their backs and let the laughs burst out of their mouths. \"I love it. It's an experience that has changed my life. Through it I rediscovered the child's laugh inside me,\"Said Romain Jouffroy, 24. \"US President George W. Bush should give it a try. He has lost his laugh,\"she joked .

The physical benefits of laughter are already well--recognized. Doctors say the act of laughing releases good chemicals into the blood--stream, while the quick breathing that accompanies it helps massage the digestive organs and strengthens the heart. \"A full hour is like having your inside go jogging!One finishes out of breath, but feels revitalized(.

      "question": "During the past Spring Festival, many children may have received red packets from their families. But Xing Pu, a 40-year-old economist, is asking the government to give red packets to every Chinese citizen. Xing suggested the government give out 1,000 Yuan to each Chinese since the government income has increased rapidly in recent years. He said his suggestion would allow everyone to directly enjoy the fruits of the country's economic success, help the lower-income groups deal with rising prices and increase consumption around the country. Recent years have seen the government carry out a series of pro-poor   and pro-rural policies, including increasing spending on public healthcare and calling off the agricultural tax. But the lower-income group still needs more help while being hit hard by an 11-year high in prices and recent snowstorms. Xing said while making the draft, he has borrowed many ideas from practices in countries like the United States and Singapore. Earlier this year, the governments of the two nations offered cash handouts to their citizens as the result of a surplus in government income. As for in China, \"We can even encourage the rich to donate their 1,000 Yuan red packet to the poor,\" said Xing. Although Xing's suggestion has gained wide support among ordinary Chinese on the Internet, many other economists criticized it as unpractical. Even Xing himself admitted he made the suggestion without any careful calculation. But they agreed with Xing's point that the growing economic pie should be shared among the people. \"To better use the increase of money, handing out money is not a solution that holds good for all time.

      "question": "Although the 2008 US presidential elections are still a long way off, candidates  are already getting ready for the campaigns ahead.    For the Democrats  , the two leading candidates are a surprising pair. The first is Hillary Clinton, 60, the wife of former President Bill Clinton. The second is Barack Obama, 45, a Harvard educated senator  .    It is the first time that the leading presidential candidates for a political party are either a woman or black. The energetic pair has certainly gotten people's attention. But the question remains, is America ready for either one?    It's not a simple question to answer. For the past 220 years, Americans have elected only white males to the nation's highest office. That can hardly be called a tradition of diversity. However, many people believe that 2008 will be the year that this changes.   \"The white men that have been running the country recently have done such a bad job, at home and abroad, that maybe now is the time for a change,\" said Dorian Cool of San Francisco, California.    The polling numbers seem to back up his opinion: 86 percent of Americans say they would vote for a qualified woman. An impressive 93 percent say they would vote for a black man if he seemed right for the job. These numbers are much higher than they were just 20 years ago. They may suggest that Americans are ready to be led by a different type of person.    Still, there is a lot to overcome. Although women represent 51 percent of the American population, there are only nine female governors out of 50. Out of 100 senators, only 16 are women. The numbers are significantly lower for blacks in office.  Since the American Civil War, only two blacks have been elected governor and only three have been elected to the Senate.    Surely both candidates face difficult odds, but never before has there been so much support for either a female or a black candidate.    As Barack Obama himself said, \"There is not a black America and a white America, a Latino America and an Asian America -- there's the United States of America.\" If others share his vision, maybe the United States will end up with a new type of leader.

The Maasai had brought along an enormous block of tanzanite and he was looking to sell. His asking price? Fifty dollars. But the gem cutter assumed that a stone so large could only be glass and refused. It turned out that the gem was genuine and could have been worth close to $3,000,000!  The gem cutter missed his chance to hit the jeweler's jackpot and make history. Would you have made the same mistake then? Will you make it today?   In the decades since its discovery, tanzanite has become one of the world's most precious gemstones. Found in only one remote place on the Earth (in Tanzania's Merelani Hills), the precious purple stone is 1,000 times rarer than diamonds. Luxury retailers have been warning that supplies of tanzanite will not last forever. And in this case, they're right. Once the last purple gem is pulled from the Earth, that's it. No more tanzanite. Most believe that we only have a few years' supply left, which is why it's so amazing for us to offer this incredible price break. Our 2-carat Tanzanite Ring is a real bargain! This is a ring designed to impress and it does not disappoint.  Now is the point where opportunity knocks, much like a Maasai tribesman on your office door.

      "question": "My Best Enemy Once again, I was in a new school. So was a girl in my class named Lisa. That's where the similarities ended. I was tall and she was small. My thick black hair had been recently cut short into an untidy style. Her natural blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great. I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations. We had a great day that afternoon. Lisa was loved by the whole neighborhood. The bookstore owners lent her fashion magazines; the movie theater gave her free tickets... Soon I was included in her magic world. We slept over at each other's houses and spent every free moment together. Lisa, my first real friend since childhood, helped me get through the rough year of early adolescence  and taught me an amazing and very surprising thing about making friends: that your worst enemy can turn out to be your best friend.

Overwork is the main reason why so many students feel tired and stressed. Cut down some of the jobs you need to do each day so that you can only concentrate on the most important things. Leaving time for activities that are relaxing and fun. This might mean reading a good book, listening to the music, going for a walk or taking a relaxing bath. Get a good night's sleep. Getting enough sleep will help you keep your body and mind in the best form. If you stay up late and need to get up early for school the next day, you may not be able to concentrate on the things you need to do. Exercise regularly and eat well. Don't rush through your meals. Eat less junk food or fast food. Eat healthy food instead. Get to know pleasant people. Some people are _ , while others not. Choose optimistic people as your friends and spend more time with them and you'll be as happy as them. Learn to be calm when you face any problem.

      "question": "Many parents try hard to protect their kids from TV and Internet advertising. But how can you protect a child from a large fast-food ad painted on her school locker  ? Or a toy ad on the side of his school bus? As school budgets get smaller, a growing number of schools in the US are selling, advertising space on lockers and buses and in gyms or cafeterias. It is an easy way for schools to make money. And ads may provide relief for parents exhausted by making cash donations to support schools. While parents can always turn off the televisions or the computers, they can't keep advertising out of schools. This isn't the first time the issue has come up. For example, a news program for teens has been criticized for including ads in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts. And parents' groups successfully fought a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and ads into school buses. But now things are different. Just last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow companies to advertise in the district's schools. Officials say the plan could provide as much as $18 million for the schools. In St. Francis, Minn., schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their lockers with ads. Time says. Edward Saxton, a teacher in the school, says, \"So far, parents are accepting this as a way to bring in needed money. The money pays for programs like arts, sports and music. Parents don't like to see programs getting cut. Neither do I. Besides, schools are thinking about the effects on kids all the time.\" However, Susan Linn, an educational expert, says, \"Kids have already seen enough ads on TV, in magazines and the products they use daily. School is no place for advertisements at all.\" Readers, what about you? Would you rather help run yet another school fundraiser, or expose your child to ads on lockers and buses? Is keeping ads out of schools worth raising taxes, or increasing your own cash support for school through donations? What does the text mainly talk about?",

      "question": "Many years ago,a French naturalist,the Count de Buffon,wrote some books about natural history.The books were a great success even though some critics did not like them.Some critics said,\"Count Buffon is more of a poet than a scientist.\" Thomas Jefferson did not like what the Count had said about the natural wonders of the New World.It seemed to Jefferson that the Count had spoken of natural wonders in America as if they were unimportant. This troubled Thomas Jefferson.He too was a naturalist,as well as a farmer,inventor,historian,writer and politician.He had seen the natural wonders of Europe.To him,they were no more important than those of the New World. In 1788,Thomas Jefferson wrote about his home state,Virginia.While writing,he thought of its natural beauty and then of the words of the Count de Buffon.At that moment.Jefferson created a new word--belittle.He said.\"The Count de Buffon believes that nature belittles her productions on this side of the Atlantic.\" Noah Webster,the American word expert,liked this word.He put it in this English language dictionary in 1806,\"Belittle--to make small,unimportant.\" Americans had already accepted Jefferson's word and started to use it.In 1797,the Independent Chronicle newspaper used the word to describe a politician the paper supported.\"He is an honorable man,\"the paper wrote,\"so let the opposition try to belittle him as much as they please.\" In 1872,a famous American word expert decided that the time had come to kill this word.He said,\"Belittle has no chance of becoming English.And as more critical writers of America,like those of Britain,feel no need of it,the sooner it is forgotten,the better.\" This expert failed to kill the word.Today.belittle is used where the English language is spoken.

      "question": "Campers Gene and Marie Marsden took pride in being good citizens when in the wild. While driving miles to the Green River Lakes area, they taught their children what they had learned in the bear safety handbook put out by the Bridger-Teton Forest Service. Mr. and Mrs. Marsden did their best to keep a tidy camp. As the handbook had said to hang all food at least ten feet off the ground and four feet out from the trees, they did that and locked their food in their trailer  at night. It was already dark when they went to bed, but they _ the campsite with flashlights, making sure nothing was left out. Following the bear book's advice, they slept a hundred yards from where they cooked their food, and kept the car near their tents, separated from the trailer, which they left up at the other camp. The Marsdens liked having their dog Spike on guard. But on the first night, Spike would not stop barking. When Marie Marsden pulled the tent open and shone her flashlight, she saw a young bear. They all piled into the car and drove quickly down the path, calling out of the window to Spike and abandoning the trailer. They drove to a pay phone and called a Fish and Game Department guard, who identified the bear by the white ring of the fur the Marsdens had seen around his neck. The authorities informed the Marsdens that the bear was a young male that they'd been keeping an eye on. The next morning, the Marsdens heard helicopters circling over the mountain and wondered if it might have something to do with the bear. After spending the night in the public campground, they drove back to their site. Wandering the area in search of clues, Marie came to a stop below a tall tree. She slapped her head and shouted, \"Oh no!\" \"What is it?\" Gene asked. Marie pointed at the ground where Spike's dog food bowl lay upside down. A week after their return home, the Marsdens read the headline in their local paper. \"Bear Killed in Wind Rivers.\" According to the article, the Fish and Game Department had shot the young bear because, having been rewarded for invading  a human campsite, it would likely to do so again. The Marsdens knew they had been lucky in the encounter, yet much to their shame and sadness, they also knew that the bear had not.

      "question": "Because I am extremely vulnerable to both slick advertising and peer pressure, I've been thinking about getting an iPad. But here's the problem: I'm cheap, and the iPad's not. If I'm going to fork over at least $499 for a new device, I want to try it out and make sure it's not just a larger, shinier version of my iPhone. But if I went to my local Apple Store, I'd get to spend only a few minutes testing out the machine. I wanted more time than that, so I rented one for $15 a day from a guy on SnapGoods. The Internet start-up in Brooklyn runs on simple reasoning: there are people who want to borrow stuff - camping equipment, food processors, robot vacuums, etc. - and there are people who have stuff they want to lend. SnapGoods helps these two groups connect over the Web. SnapGoods is one of many sites that have sprung up to facilitate offline sharing. Some sites have a narrow, obvious focus (like SwapBabyGoods.com) while others are more obscure (Neighborhood Fruit helps people share what's growing in their yards or find fruit trees on public land). But regardless of whether the sharing is free or involves a fee, these transactions often come with a stick-it-to-the-man attitude. \"Borrow these things from your neighbors,\" reads one earnest request on neighborrow.com, \"The owner-ship has SAILED!\" All of these sites are encouraging something academics call collaborative consumption - in other words, peer-to-peer sharing or renting. Renting something you don't need to use very often makes a lot more sense than buying it and letting it collect dust in your garage. There's a green aspect as well, since sharing helps cut down on overall use of resources. But one of collaborative consumption's most surprising benefits turns out to be social. In an era when families are scattered around the country and we may not know the people down the street from us, sharing things - even with strangers we've just met online - allows us to make meaningful connections. \"This isn't just about saving the environment or saving a dollar,\" says SnapGoods CEO Ron Williams, who came up with the idea after renting a stranger's motorcycle via Craigslist. \"This is about saving yourself by making informed consumer decisions.\" I'm not sure if I got a thrill when I borrowed Goodwin's iPad, but it did feel good to make a connection. In the end, though, I decided not to purchase an iPad. Sorry, Steve Jobs. I'm just not that into owning things anymore. Which of the following can best serve as the title of the passage?",

I tried to explain but the teacher refused to hear me out. She punished me by making me stand by the door. I knew I was right. Such punishment to a class topper was simply unheard of. But, slowly, my pride disappeared. Instead of being angry, I understood the other students who have been punished at times. For the first time, I felt humbled  .

I'm very fortunate--mine isn't. I pretty much live a regular life, except for people asking me about it all the time, which can get annoying  sometimes. When I was about 4 years old, I asked my mom why there weren't any characters with birthmarks in the books she would read to me. When we went to the library, we realized there weren't any available for little kids. Worse than that, the books available to older kids and adults described characters with birthmarks as unattractive. So I decided to write my own. I based the story on all the real things that happened in my life. But instead of people, the characters in the book are real animals from the Galapagos Islands, including red-footed booby birds  . I picked a booby bird as the main character because the birds have red feet due to a vascular   condition, similar to a human birthmark! It was really tough to get my book published. It took a long time because a lot of publishers refused to publish it. They would say there wasn't a big enough market for a book about birthmarks. But my mom never gave up trying to help make my dream come true. And in 2005, she finally took her own money and self-published \"Buddy Booby's Birthmark\".

And the funny thing is that people just can't wrap their heads around the fact that people who have reached some success get tons of time to just relax, but only because they've earned it ! If you haven't built a successful business, or in some way built a career that allow you so much freee time, then you are stuck in the grinding world of nine-to-five jobs everyone else. So how comfortable is that ? So what can you do about it ? Well, find a way to make something happen in your life--- build a business around your favourite hobby, write a book and publish it, or take a course in stock trading and become an expert at that, working on making enough money to retire. If you don't take massive action that puts your way of your comfort zone, you will never be successful at much of anything. I promise--- and I don't make many promises ! Finding real happiness in life can be a mystery for many. That's why I wrote The Road to Happiness for those who want real success and happiness in life, including spirituality and all the gifts life has to offer. Don't wander aimlessly through life.

      "question": "Is it possible that the sinking of the Titanic was caused by a ghost? A plot of the story below is true ... but did it really happen quite like this? Our story begins not in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic, but rather thousands of miles away in Egypt. It is here, perhaps, that we can find the start of the mystery   of the Titanic, in the year 1910, in the great city of Cairo. One day, a famous professor of Egyptian history called Douglas Murray was staying in Cairo, when he was contacted by an American adventurer. The American had something unusual to offer Murray, something that was certain to thrill him: a beautiful ancient Egyptian mummy case, containing the mummy of an Egyptian queen. It was over 3,000 years old, but in beautiful condition -- gold, with bright paintings on it. Murray was delighted with both the object and the askingprice. He gave the man a cheque immediately. The cheque was never cashed. That evening the American adventurer died. For his part, Murray arranged to have the treasure sent back to Britain. However, it was not long before he learnt more about the beautiful mummy case: On the walls of the tomb in which it had been discovered, there were messages which warned of terrible consequences to anyone who broke into the tomb. Murray was disbelieving of these warnings until a few days later, when a gun he was holding exploded in his hand, shattering his arm. The arm had to be cut off. After the accident, Murray decided to return to his homeland. On the return journey, two of his companions died mysteriously, and two servants who had handled the mummy also passed away. The nowterrified Murray decided he would get rid of the _ case as soon as he arrived in London. A lady he knew named Janet Jones said she would like it, so he gave it to her. Shortly afterwards, Jones' mother died, and she herself caught a strange disease. She tried returning the mummy, but naturally Murray refused it. In the end, it was presented to the British Museum. Even in the museum, the mummy apparently continued to cause strange events. A museum photographer died shortly after taking pictures of the new exhibit, and a manager also died for no apparent reason. In the end, the British Museum decided to get rid of the mummy too. They sold it to a collector in New York. At the start of April 1912, arrangements for the transfer were complete, and the mummy began the journey to its new home. But the New Yorker never received the mummy or its case. For when the Titanic sank, one of the objects in its strongroom was the mummy case. Or so they say.

      "question": "The wombat  is in trouble. Some are dying in bushfires, or being shot by farmers. Others are scratching themselves to death because of a mite  infection. Only 115 of one species - the northern hairy-nosed wombat - remain alive in the wild.  Wombats are endemic to Australia. They are found nowhere else. A wombat looks like an overgrown, stocky guinea pig, covered with thick grey fur and with a wide, flat, broad forehead. Fully-grown adults are about a meter long and about half a meter tall. They weigh about 40kg.  But while their looks are pretty straightforward, people throughout history have found it less easy to understand their behavior. The Aborigines  seem to have mixed feelings about them, According to one story, the wombat once said he was more powerful than the sun. After a competition, however, the wombat lost, and so today hides from shame, deep down in a hole. But another Aboriginal story tells of how wise the wombat can be. He comforts the other animals in the forest, after their friend, a cockatoo, has died, explaining to them all about forest spirits. Wombats are strong diggers, with very powerful front legs and sharp claws, usually used to dig winding holes in the ground for their homes. Yet despite their strong appearance, these animals are struggling to survive.  Many have been suffering a lot from a foreign mite, from foreign foxes, introduced for hunting by the early English settlers of Australia. Because of scratching, scars form over the wombats' eyes and ears, and infections occur, finally causing their death. Its population is so small that the group is becoming inbred . Competition with cattle and sheep for grass to eat, drought, bushfires, as well as dingo and feral dog attacks have all whittled away wombat numbers.   But fortunately, a group of committed volunteers and scientists, working with the local government, has now put up fences to protect the wombats from meat-eating animals, made holes for extra shelter, and is working with zoos to create developing programs. These conservationists are well aware they have little time left. What would be the best title for the passage?",

      "question": "Your dog is as smart as any two year old, according to a new study. Dogs bring much happiness to their owners, and even improve human health. Most two year olds keep us busy in life -- an important part of living a long and happy life. According to Stanley Coren, Ph.D.of the University of British Columbia, our dogs are smarter than we thought. Dr.Coren reviewed many studies to find out that dogs are as smart as 2 to 2.5 year olds. Forget about one word orders -- according to Coren, the smartest dogs can learn up to 250 words. Most dogs understand an average of 165 words. \"The upper limit of dogs\" ability to learn language is partly based on a study of a Border Collie   named Rico who showed knowledge of 200 spoken words, and 'fast-track learning', which scientists believed to be found only in humans and language-learning apes .  Dogs are also great at tricking. During play, they have the ability to trick humans and other dogs in order to get treats. \"And they are nearly as successful in tricking humans as humans are in tricking dogs, saysCoren. Dogs can also count to four or five, which might explain how they know when their toys are missing. Coren explains,\"Their astonishing flashes of smartness and creativity are reminders that they may not be Ensteins, but are sure closer to humans than we thought.\" Animals can do much to keep us happy, health, and protect us from harm. Stories of dog heroes can be found using a simple Internet search. Pets teach us sense of duty, keep us from loneliness, and can help with treatment of the disabled.

Wang Ming is a 14-year-old junior student in Wuhan. He said \"All my pocket money has a place to go now. I can pay my own school fees  .\" Zhu Yu, a manager   of Minsheng Bank, said that they knew lots of students who didn't know how to use their money.

      "question": "Normally and naturally, a daughter is more attached to her mother in comparison to her father or other siblings  . The attachment is also due to the fact that the daughter finds it easier to believe in the mother on personal and biological matters at different stages while growing up.  The bonding   between mother and daughter will increase with their being together and going out on excursions. An excursion is a journey to some far-off place undertaken by people. It is not necessary that such a trip be taken on a lavish   scale involving lots of money. It can be as short as an overnight trip to some place to improve bonding.  To surprise her daughter with an unexpected excursion, mother can plan a trip to some local spa without the knowledge of her daughter. She can be ready with baggage packed and wait for the moment the daughter comes back from school. Once in the hotel they can enjoy the night together getting refreshing treatments like massage or mud packs. After relaxing spa they can laze in bed, enjoying favourite food or drink and if possible enjoying nature through the window. After a long period of relaxation, going out for a walk together will improve bonding.  Going out overnight to enjoy walk at the beach, and relaxing at intervals without the interference of any other person can be a great idea of bonding. Being of the same sex, and often having the same set of likes and dislikes, they can spend time on makeup or applying nail polish. The daughter should never forget to thank the mother for the wonderful time they spent together, and the mother should never hesitate to say a few words of praise to the daughter.  Going out for shopping together is a good bonding idea too. It is not essential that lots of money should be spent on shopping. The mother can take the daughter to some shops where she can buy her uniform or some other things. They can jointly enjoy window shopping, expressing love and gratitude for the other.

      "question": "You may have heard the term \"the American Dream\". In 1848, James W. Marshall found gold in California and people began having golden dreams. That 19th century \"American Dream\" motivated   the Gold Rush and gave California its nickname of the \"Golden State\". The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next. People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets. But most, instead, worked as railroad labourers. They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \"the old gold hill\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare. Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley. People poured their energy into the Internet. This new chapter of the American Dream attracted many business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups and seek fortunes in America. Better pay, a nice house, and a rising standard of living will always be attractive. However, the new American Dream is no longer just about money. It encourages Americans to consume wisely to protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and promote social justice. The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become the model of the new American Dream.

      "question": "Humans may not have landed on Mars   just yet, but that isn't stopping a European company from devising a plan to send four people to the Red Planet within the next few years. This project, called Mars One, aims to send a small group of people to Mars in 2022 and eventually establish a permanent colony on the planet. \"Everything we need to go to Mars exists,\" said Mars One co-founder Bas Lansdorp in March 2014. \"We have the rockets to send people to Mars, the equipment to land on Mars, the robots to prepare the settlement for humans. For a one-way mission, all the technology exists.\" Yet the four astronauts chosen for the trip will be stuck on Mars--forever. And despite Mars One's thorough planning, there are a number of challenges that may prevent the mission from ever taking place. The biggest road block could be the mission's huge cost ($6 billion). However, Lansdorp is confident that Mars One will be able to fund the project by selling the broadcast rights for the mission and subsequent experiences living on the planet. Those broadcast rights will also play a part in helping to select the people who will be sent to Mars. Lansdorp said the company will hold a selection process similar to a reality show. Lansdorp is expecting at least 1 million applications from people around the world. In addition to the cost, several other potential problems could inhibit   the mission to Mars. \"It's even more challenging to send people there with life support, with food, with air, with all the other things like books, entertainment, means of communication and of providing for their own resources for a long stay on Mars,\" said Adam Baker, senior lecturer in space engineering at Kingston University in London. \"The size of the rockets you'd need to do this would be absolutely _ \" Which of the following is an appropriate title for this passage?",

When I knocked on the door, I met in an instant an angry look and a few harsh words. When the door was slammed in my face, I stood there shocked, and in a rush, I was reminded of my dog bit my father 20 years ago or so. What brought that story back was that same feeling of betrayal. Both stories taught me something the next day. You see, when I got up in the morning and was told my dog had died, it became clear to me that he must have been in great pain.

First, it is very cheap to buy a bike, and it is quick, too. You often need to wait for a bus for half an hour.

Then one day, a friend of mine says, \"I go to work by bike. Why don't we travel together?\" \"Because my bike is old, and there are so many buses and cars on the roads. I'll feel frightened.\" I answer. \"Don't be afraid, if you follow me and we ride slowly, you'll be fine.\" he says. Later, I buy a new bike. We go slowly, but we arrive at work quickly. I spend 40 minutes going by bus, but only half an hour by bike! Now I love riding a bike. And I feel healthy.

The game was born more than forty years ago on the physical education fields of Gulf Shores School. This kind of basketball, invented by Philip Bryant, has grown from an extremely effective skill improvement game to a very popular, widespread competitive sport. http://www.beachbasketball.com Street Basketball Street Basketball or streetball is mainly played as a leisure  game, but streetball players can also compete against each other. There are no specific streetball rules and the game is played outdoors; the players make up their own rules to play.

For instance, nearly 600 local foster kids changed families every year, and they carried their belongings from one home to the next in black garbage bags. Noah, then ten, couldn't imagine squeezing his clothes, favorite toy, and soccer ball into a trash bag and dragging it to a new house in the middle of the night. \"Packing kids' belongings into garbage bags is like telling them that their stuff has no more worth than trash,\" says Noah. So with help from his parents and younger sisters, Macy, then nine, and Molly, then seven, Noah began to collect suitcases and duffel bags from friends and extended family; he received more than 100 bags in less than two weeks. He then sent letters to churches and put ads in local newspapers and on radio stations asking for donations. Within a few months, the family was collecting about 500 bags a week, which they stored briefly in their spare bathroom and downstairs hallway before giving them to foster care caseworkers at the Department for Community Based Services. In addition to suitcases, Noah now provides foster kids with backpacks containing shampoo, soap, a journal, and a toy--all donated. \"My hope is that by giving the children things that are just theirs, they will feel a little control in the midst of the chaos,\" says Noah. Noah's group, A Case for Dignity, collects and distributes hundreds of bags a year. He recently convinced foster care managers from 15 Kentucky counties to pledge to use his bags instead of trash bags. \"I've been so inspired by him,\" says his mom. \"If a ten-year-old can see a problem and create a solution, how much more can we do as adults?\" What is Noah like based on the text?",

Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading inAmericapresents a detailed review of the decline of reading's role in the nation's culture.      Readingat Risk is a survey of national fashion in adult literary reading. The data source for Reading at Risk is as reliable and objective   as any such survey can be.

Reading a book requires a degree of active attention and devotion. Indeed, reading itself is a progressive skill that depends on years of education and practice. On the contrary, most electronic media such as television, recordings, and radio make fewer demands on their audiences, and indeed often require no more than passive participation. While oral culture has a rich reality and electronic media offer the considerable advantages of variety, print culture affords irreplaceable forms of focused attention and thought that make various communications and views possible. The decline in reading, therefore, equals a larger retreat   from participation in public and cultural life.      What is to be done? There is surely no single solution to the present problem, just as there is no single cause. The important thing now is to understand thatAmericacan no longer take active and devoted reading for granted.      Readingis not a timeless, common ability.

Since its beginning in 1980, the Edmonton Folk Music Festival has been commemorating   the true feeling of what folk music is all about and that's the traditional togetherness that is felt when people gather to share stories and feelings through song. This year will be the sixth year when volunteer Riedel will be offering up her time to the festival. \"People coming off a busy spring and summer have a moment of relaxation,\" Riedel said. \"It's really easy to relax, and it's great seeing family and friends have fun together.\" These families and friends come from all different kinds of musical tastes. People who take pleasure in Blues are there, so are people who love Bluegrass. This festival does its best to develop everyone's musical interests. With so many years of experience, the festival has become a well-oiled machine, and does whatever it can to make attendees feel as comfortable as possible. There are free water stations throughout the venue   for people to fill up their travel cups. When people buy food, reusable dishes are given a $2 plate fee, but that is returned when the plate is brought back. The festival has completely sold out of tickets, and in record time. But with big names such as Van Morrison and Jakob Dylan, it's easy to see how that was going to happen. There is no parking area during the festival, so using the Park & Ride system or Edmonton Transit is highly recommended. A bike lock-up area is provided and will be available Thursday until Sunday one hour before the gates open until 45 minutes after the gates close.

However, trendy teenagers in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand can't wait to get them on, even if they don't need them. Braces are the latest teenage fashion trend in Southeast Asia. Having a mouthful of metal has become so popular with Asian teens that there have been reports of many teens wearing fake  braces. Many Asian beauty shops are now offering to put in cheap fake braces. There are even cheaper do-it-yourself braces such as \" Hello Kitty,\" Mickey Mouse\" or others for a price of around $100. Braces are considered a sign of wealth in Southeast Asia. A real set of braces in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, for example, will cost around $ 1,200, which is a large amount for the country with a GDP of $345 billion ( a billion is 1,000 million), compared to the US which had a GDP of $1,506 Trillion ( a Trillion is 1,000 billion) last year. While Asian teens may think that their colorful fake braces are cool, experts say that these trendy fashion braces can cause illness and can even lead to death. According to the New York Daily News, fake fashion braces have already been linked to the deaths of two teens in Thailand.A 17-year-old in the northeast city of Khon Kaen died from heart failure caused by a thyroid infection  from a pair of fake fashion braces.

Do you know the name of this famous lake? It's called the Dead Sea. It's called this because no living thing could live there. The water is almost dead, compared to what happens with \"living water\". When you think of the term \"living water\", the image that comes to mind is a rushing river that is flowing. It's filled with life and movement. It doesn't just \"receive\", but is also \"giving\" simultaneously. Many of us believe that we need to receive more of something in order to be happy. Whether what we desire is money or something else, we think we need more of it in order to be fulfilled. As a result, we begin to operate in fear and therefore don't give anything because we're afraid that we won't have enough. The result? Like the Dead Sea, we become lifeless. Life is meant to flow. when a pool stops flowing, it becomes stagnant . Stagnant water breeds disease and death. It can't breathe. It can't receive any more.

      "question": "Once I complained to my husband that he wasn't helping enough with our daughter, and I gave him a long list of the parenting chores   I was shouldering on my own. \"But you like doing all that stuff,\" he said. I thought about that while reading a new study about the responsibilities of parenting. Researchers asked 191 college professors, both men and women, who had children 2 or younger, the pleasure they experienced from childcare. On 16 out of 25 childcare tasks--like taking a child to the doctor or buying clothes for a child--women reported statistically higher levels of enjoyment than men. The only parenting issue that gave women less pleasure than it gave men was having to manage who does what for the child. On the whole, women's scores were 10 percent higher than men's. Women are also far more likely to take advantage of family-leave benefits to care for children. In the study, all the universities offered paid family leave, and 69 percent of the women took it, while only 12 percent of the men did. In Sweden, where family leave for both parents is particularly generous, men use about 20 percent of the 480-day benefit. Women use nearly all of it. It's difficult to know how cultural and economic pressures or biological functions influence parenting. Plenty of men change diapers  , and studies show that mothers and fathers alike spend more time with children than they used to. Men have more than doubled the time they spend on childcare since 1985. Yet women still spend twice as much time with the kids as men, says the University of Maryland sociologist John Robinson. Notably in the study, the parenting activity that gave men the most pleasure (and women, too) was playing and talking with their kids. But when men were asked to rate how often they actually did those things, their scores were about 10 and 40 percent lower than women's. In the end, perhaps the issue is not that mothers are doing too many childcare tasks--my husband was right when he said I liked being a mother--but that men, for all their progress as fathers, are still missing out.

That's the question that David Sarno seeks to answer. \"It's very common for people to say, 'Why do I need a library when I've got a computer?'\" said Pam Sandlian-Smith, director of the seven-branch Rangeview, Colo. , Library District. \"We have to reframe what the library means to the community.\" In the struggle to stay important-and ultimately  to stay open-libraries are reinventing themselves in ways unimaginable even a few years ago, preparing for a future in which most materials can be checked and read from a home computer, smartphone or electronic reading device. But not all library professionals are enthusiastic about the community-building efforts. Sandlian-Smith and others like her have taken: \"If you want to have game rooms and pingpong tables and God knows what-poker parties-fine, do it, but don't pretend it has anything to do with libraries,\" said Michael Gorman, a former president of the American Library Assn. \"The argument that all these young people would turn up to play video games and think, 'Oh by the way, I must borrow that book by Dostoyevsky'-it seems ridiculous to me.\" Sarno reports that lending books is taking a back seat as libraries diversify their holdings-DVDs! E-books! -and struggle to define how they can serve their local communities. And yet libraries can also serve a wider audience; some are bringing rare archival  materials online. That doesn't mean that there are e-books available yet for everything in their collections.

      "question": "Can technology improve your trip? Meet Judy Williams. When she and her husband recently checked into Blu Hotel in Zurich, a clerk asked them to sign the dotted line on a room rate hundreds of dollars higher than their online offer. \"It was not a cheap stay,\" says Williams, a lawyer from Billings, Mont. But it became more of one after her husband fired up the Booking.com app he'd used to book their room on his smart phone. \"As soon as we showed him the cost, he honored it,\" Williams says. Technology may create challenges for travelers but it can also solve them. It's more than making sure of a hotel cost. The latest Booking.com can help users select hotels by location, make a secure booking and view the confirmed   cost so they never need to re-discuss their hotel price. Another pain point for travelers is traffic that eats away precious vacation time. There's a new app called Commute which is aimed at users who have to make the same trip every day. But if you're headed to Los Angeles or Honolulu, where visitors can easily get stuck in hours of heavy traffic, Commute can help. Just input basic information about your destination and expected leaving time, and the app will start sending you traffic information 15 minutes before you leave. Testing Commute proved to be a challenge for me, because my home address is about 900 miles from my place of work. But if you have only a short distance to travel through a heavily populated area, you can use Commute to avoid traffic jams. Another source of travel-related problems is money. That's particularly true when you're dealing with a foreign currency. The latest Travel Money Tracker helps travelers prevent currency mix-ups. It immediately changes a country's native currency to yours, so you know exactly how much that Espresso   in Milan costs in dollars. It can also warn you when you're overspending, which can sometimes be a problem when you're on vacation. The only catch, of course, is that you have to remember to record all your purchases. Taken together, these apps solve some of the most common travel problems. But not all of them. Some things, no smart phone can fix, which means I get to keep my job - for now at least.

      "question": "People in Shanghai can quench their thirst with high quality water if the Shanghai Water Authority (SWA) is able to make good on its word. It has vowed to make the city's water match its status as a world class city. \"The current tap water quality meets national standards, but, compared with that of the European Union and the United States, it still needs to be improved.\" said the SWA's director general, Hang Jiayi. In other developed countries, water fountains can be found almost everywhere--people do not bother with bottled drinking water. By 2020, the water of the Huangpu River will be treated to reduce the amount of organic waste in it. Major water works that draw water from the Huangpu will need more treatment facilities to improve the colour, texture, ammonia and nitrogen content before 2010. These treatment facilities are expected to cost 4 billion yuan, something that could affect the price of water, according to Chen Yin, SWA's deputy director general. Chen said that replacing water pipes was also a key project. The city's aged pipes are mostly to blame for the bad water quality. The SWA has started the water facilities renovation work, including the more than 14,000 kilometres of indoor piping, 107,000 tanks on top of the buildings, and more than 6,000 underground facilities. World Water Day came on March 22, and this year's theme is \"Water for the future\". Beijing is also drawing up plans during China's Water Week, which runs until March 28.

Until the early 1950s, most scientists thought the body and brain rested during sleep. Then a scientist watched people sleep. He noticed that during periods of between 5 and 30 minutes each, sleepers' eyes made rapid movements, as if they were watching something. He called these periods REM sleep, for Rapid Eye Movement. Periods when sleepers' eyes did not move he called non-REM sleep. Whenever the scientist woke people during REM sleep, they were having vivid dreams. Measurements showed that sleepers' pulses went up quickly during REM sleep. Their breathing, heartbeat, and the blood going to the brain also increased. Far from being a time of rest, REM sleep is a time when the body is hard at work. Scientists still don't know the reason for this. Some believe REM sleep makes learning easier. Babies spend a lot of time in REM sleep. Because of this, some scientists believe that REM sleep helps the brain grow. Others think REM sleep is a time for the brain to empty the day's garbage.

Xinhua, the state news agency, said late on Wednesday that 357 officials are to face punishment, with 192 criminal cases already filed and 202 people detained after improperly stored or transported vaccines were sent to 59 health institutions. This is the latest in a string of food and drug safety scandals in a country where parents often import products for infants and babies from overseas to ensure quality. Many remember with fear the 2008 milk powder scandal, in which infant formula laced with melamine caused at least six deaths and 300,000 children to fall ill. Beijing last month made public an illegal operation in eastern Shandong province in which a hospital pharmacist and her daughter traded $88m in vaccines that may have been compromised because they were expired or improperly stored or transported. The China Food and Drug Administration said, however, that the vaccines posed no greater than the normal risk to patients. \"We don't see that the vaccines' effectiveness has been reduced,\" added the health watchdog in a report. Nonetheless, health officials fear a backlash against Chinese-manufactured vaccines, which already have a reputation for being more dangerous than those made overseas.  Wang Yuedan, deputy director of Peking University's immunology department, said the key to evaluating risks is to check whether package seals are broken or for pollution with micro-organisms. \"The vaccines in the Shandong case don't have those problems,\" he said. Those vaccines had been subject to higher than normal temperatures that could have lowered their effectiveness and reduced their protective value. But the official investigation showed the vaccines \"are still effective\", he said. Beijing, which publicized the affair almost a year after it was exposed, and several years after it started, appeared eager to show commitment to crack down on abuses by announcing the action, political analysts said. The CFDA said a system was being set up to track vaccines from production to use. The World Health Organization warned the scandal could endanger China's public health gains if parents become distrustful of vaccines. It also expressed confidence in Chinese vaccines, saying public immunization campaigns had erased polio  and sharply reduced cases of hepatitis B and measles.

      "question": "Whether we're 2 years old or 62, our reasons for lying are mostly the same: to get out of trouble, for personal gain and to make ourselves look better in the eyes of others. But a growing body of research is raising questions about how a child's lie is different from an adult's lie, and how the way we _ changes as we grow. \"Parents and teachers who catch their children lying should not be alarmed. Their children are not going to turn out to be abnormal liars,\" says Dr. Lee, a professor at the University of Toronto and director of the Institute of Child Study. He has spent the last 15 years studying how lying changes as kids get older, why some people lie more than others as well as which factors can reduce lying. The fact that children tell lies is a sign that they have reached a new developmental stage. Dr. Lee conducted a series of studies in which they bring children into a lab with hidden cameras. Children and young adults aged 2 to 17 are likely to lie while being told not to look at a toy, which is put behind the child's back. Whether or not the child takes a secret look is caught on tape. For young kids, the desire to cheat is big and 90% take a secret look in these experiments. When the test-giver returns to the room, the child is asked if he or she looked secretly. At age 2, about a quarter of children will lie and say they didn't. By 3, half of kids will lie, and by 4, that figure is 90%, studies show. Researchers have found that it's kids with better understanding abilities who lie more. That's because to lie you also have to keep the truth in mind, which includes many brain processes, such as combining several sources of information and faking that information. The ability to lie -- and lie successfully  -- is thought to be related to development of brain regions that allow so called \"executive functioning\", or higher order thinking and reasoning abilities. Kids who perform better on tests that involve executive functioning also lie more. It can be inferred from the passage that  _  .",

Although they made a modest living for their family of 10, they insisted on sharing with those less fortunate. Half a century later, Mrs. Cooper became a beloved volunteer at the San Diego Food Bank, where she devoted herself to helping others. She organized and ran a distribution center from a church, helping it become the organization's largest emergency food distribution center in San Diego. She was one of 25 outstanding senior volunteers in the nation selected and invited to Washington D.C. to receive the award. \"She was the main person who helped us make that program grow,\" said Mike Doody, former director of the Food Bank. \"She had a way of getting people to work together and to work hard. She was determined and stubborn, but in a good way. She had a good heart.\" People knew her as \"Grandma\" because of her selflessness and her devotion to helping hungry children and families. \"She reminded people of their Grandma.\" Doody said. As a widow with a young child in 1979, Mrs. Cooper was helped through a difficult financial time when the Food Bank provided her with groceries. \"She dedicated her life to giving back,\" said her daughter, Monica Cooper. \"She loved life, and she loved people. She was very outgoing, caring and very concerned about our community.\"  Cooper said it wasn't unusual for a local church to call Mrs. Cooper to ask her to aid a needy family. \"She would give people food out of her cupboard.

They attempt to catch the reader's interest with pictures and exciting headlines. These techniques are used on the front page because it is the first thing you see when you pick up the paper. The first page attracts attention and encourages the reader to look through the rest of the paper. This is why editors always look for a good first page story and headline to make them stop and look.

They may read the headlines, but that is all, then they turn to the sports page, or comics, or advertisements. It seems that people do not want the news from a newspaper anymore.

During the world wars, DST was used for the late summers beginning January 1917 and 1942, and the full summers beginning September 1942 and 1943. In 1967, Tasmania experienced a drought . The State Government introduced one hour of daylight saving that summer as a way of saving power and water. Tasmanians liked the idea of daylight saving and the Tasmanian Government has declared daylight saving each summer since 1968. Persuaded by the Tasmanian Government, all states except two passed a law in 1971, for a test use of daylight saving. In 1972, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria joined Tasmania for regular daylight saving, but Queensland did not do so until 1989. Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia have had irregular plans, often changing their dates due to politics or festivals . For example, in 1992, Tasmania extended daylight saving by an extra month while South Australia began extending daylight saving by two weeks for the Adelaide Festival. Special daylight saving plans were made during the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The differences in daylight saving in Australia continue to cause serious problems in transport and many other social activities.

Flags were also flown there to warn sailors of bad weather. It's fitting, then, the Italian Gulielmo Marconi should have chosen this site   to receive the world's first radio signal -- in Morse code -- from England on December 12, 1901.      Marconi, combining earlier ideas with his own, led us to a new communications age. For the next 50 years, until the appearance of television, radio ruled the air waves.     Today, it's the TV that rules. No single person can say to have invented television.     In 1884, the German Paul Nipkow invented a device   that sent pictures mechanically  , and in 1906, Boris Rosing, a Russian, used a ray and a disc to create the world's first TV system. Then in the early 1920s, another Russian, Vladimir Zworykin,invented a picture display tube. He took out a patent   for color1 TV, even though it wouldn't be developed for another 25 years.      In 1924, a Scot entered the scene -- John Logie Baird. He first succeeded in sending a moving picture and a year later got the first actual TV picture. In 1926, Baird showed TV in aLondonlaboratory. Two years later inNew York, Felix the Cat became the first TV star. TV excited everyone's imagination, but hardly anyone had a set, with just two thousand in use worldwide in the mid-1930s.  Since the late 1940s, TV technology has developed very quickly. Computers may finally be combined with all televisions to give people a total all-in-one communications network.  Today, it's possible to sit and watch TV in the middle of a forest or in the Arctic. It's surprising when one considers that Marconi was on Signal Hill in the same century.

      "question": "You are enrolled in a full - time school called \"life\". Each day in this school you will have the opportunity to learn lessons. You may like the lessons or hate them, but you have designed them as part of your curriculum. Why are you here? What is your purpose? Humans have sought to discover the meaning of life for a very long time. What we and our ancestors have overlooked, however, is that there is no one answer. The meaning of life is different for every individual.  Each person has his or her own purpose and distinct path, unique and separate from anyone else's. As you travel your life path, you will be presented with numerous lessons that you will need to learn in order to fulfill that purpose. The lessons you are presented with are specific to you; learning these lessons is the key to discovering and fulfilling the meaning and connection of your own life.  As you travel through your lifetime, you may encounter challenging lessons that others don't have to face, while others spend years struggling with challenges that you don't need to deal with. You may never know why you are blessed with a wonderful marriage, while your friends suffer through bitter arguments and painful divorces, just as you cannot be sure why you struggle financially while your peers enjoy abundance. The only thing you can count on for certain is that you will be presented with all the lessons that you specifically need to learn; whether you choose to learn them or not is entirely up to you.  The challenge here, therefore, is to align (......) yourself with your own unique path by learning individual lessons. This is one of the most difficult challenges you will be face with in your lifetime, as sometimes your path will be completely different from others'. But, remember, don't compare your path to the people around you and focus on the difference between their lessons and yours. You need to remember that you will only be faced with lessons that you are capable of learning and are specific to your own growth.      Our sense of fairness is the expectation of equality - the assumption that all things are equal and justice will always prevail. Life is not, in fact, fair, and you may indeed have a more difficult life path than others around you, deserved or not. Everyone's circumstances are unique, and everyone needs to handle his or her own circumstances differently. If you want to move toward calm, you will be required to move out of the complaining phase of \"it's not fair\". Focusing on the unfairness of circumstances keeps you comparing yourself with others rather than appreciating your own special uniqueness. You miss out on learning your individual lessons by distracting yourself with feelings of bitterness and anger. From the passage we can conclude_.",

A new study shows that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking. It compared their risk to whites, Japanese-Americans and Latinos. Researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii did the new study. The New England Journal of Medicine published the findings. The eight-year research studied more than 180,000 people. They included present and former smokers and people who never smoked. Almost 2,000 people in the study developed lung cancer. Researchers say genetics might help explain the racial and ethnic differences. There could be differences in how people's bodies react to smoke. But environmental influences, including the way people smoke, could also make a difference. African-Americans and Latinos in the study are reported smoking the fewest cigarettes per day. Whites are the heaviest smokers. But the scientists point out that blacks have been reported to breathe cigarette smoke more deeply than white smokers. This could fill their lungs with more of the chemicals in tobacco that cause cancer. Scientists know that some diseases effect different groups differently. And some drug companies have begun to develop racially targeted medicines. Last June, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a drug designed to treat heart failure in black patients.

Founded in 1852, it was one of the first and most ambitious US department scores. Mr. Selfridge had done well with Marshall Field's. He liked to say, \"The customer is always right,\" which made the Chicago store popular. And he is believed to have invented the phrase \"Only [so many] Shopping Days until Christmas\". When he visited London on holiday in 1906 he was surprised to find most of the city's department stores were no match of their American and Parisian competitors. This led Selfridge to leave the US and establish Selfridges. a department store named after him. at the west end of London's Oxford Street. In Oxford Street, Selfridge's design team shaped an ambitious classical palacc building with a wall of plate glass windows. Opened in 1909, Selfridges offered customers a hundred departments along with restaurants, a roof garden, reading and writing rooms, reception areas for foreign visitors, a first aid room and. most importantly, a small army of knowledgeable floor-walking assistants who served as guides as well as being thoroughly instructed in the art of making a sale. Mr. Selfridge did much to make the department store a destination rather than just a big and comprehensively stocked city shop. It became a place to meet and for ladies to lunch.

      "question": "Children are quick to ask \"why\" and \"how'' when it comes to new things, but research suggests that they learn more when teachers turn the questions back on them. \"When children explain events, they learn more than when just getting the results,'' said Cristine H. Legare, a professor at the University of Texas. Ms. Legare brought in 96 children aged 3 to 5 and set before them a complex toy made up of colorful, interlocking gears  . With the first group, the researchers asked, \"Can you explain this to me?\" With the second one, they said, \"Look, isn't this interesting?'' The two groups of children focused on different things, researchers found. Children who were asked to observe noticed the colors of the toy, while those asked to explain focused on the chain of gears working on each other. Children who had explained the toy were better at re-creating it and not being disturbed by decorative gears, and they were better able to use what they had learned who had observed the toy outperformed the children in the explanation group on a memory task focused on the toy's colors. Dedre Gentner, the director of the cognitive science program at Northwestern University, said that teachers introducing a concept can improve students' understanding  by  giving examples of close comparisons,  and then asking children to explain how concepts are related. In a series of experiments with 3-to 7-year-olds, she focus children can be con be confused by comparisons that focus on a relationship rather than a direct-object match. For example, a 3-year-old shown a picture of two rabbits facing each other and told \"this is a toma '' and then asked to find another \"tome\" will choose a picture of a rabbit over one of two cats facing each other 98 percent of the time. A 7-year-old is more likely to recognize the more abstract comparison of a relationship. However, Ms. Gentner found that 3-year-olds can think more like 7-yesr-olds if they are given more examples. When shown a \"toma\" with rabbits and another with cats, and then asked, \"Can you say why both of these are tomas?\" most of the children can give a good explanation.

      "question": "The Swiss army knife is a popular device that is recognized all over the world. In Switzerland, there is a saying that every good Swiss citizen has one in his or her pocket. But the knife had poor beginnings. In the late nineteenth century, the Swiss army issued  its soldiers a gun that required a special screwdriver  to take it apart and clean it. At the same time, canned food was becoming common in the army. Swiss generals decided to issue each soldier a standard knife to serve both as a screwdriver and a can opener.  _ was a lifesaver for Swiss knife makers, who were struggling to compete with cheaper German imports. In 1884, Carl Elsener, head of the Swiss knife manufacturer(maker) Victorinox, seized that opportunity with both hands, and designed a soldier's knife that the army loved. It was a simple knife with one big blade , a can opener, and a screwdriver. A few years after the soldier's knife was issued, the \"Schweizer Offizier Messer,\" or Swiss Officer's Knife, came on the market. Interestingly, the Officer's Knife was never given to those serving in the army. The Swiss army purchasers considered the new model with a corkscrew  for opening wine not \"essential for survival,\" so officers had to buy this new model by themselves. But its special multi-functional design later launched  the knife as a global brand. After the Second World War, a great number of American soldiers were stationed in Europe. And as they could buy the Swiss army knife at shops on army bases, they bought huge quantities of them. However, it seems that \"Schweizer Offizier Messer\" was too difficult for them to say, so they just called it the Swiss army knife, and that is the name it is now known by all over the world.

      "question": "Psychologists have discovered that even the most independent-minded of us will conform to social pressure when we are with a group of people. In one classie experiment, people were showna vertical line and asked to find a line of identical length from a selection of three. You might think that this is an absurdly easy task, and when people perform it by themselves they do it very well. However, psychologists have discovered that we are very easily swayed by the opinions of other people when we do this task in a group. In one study, a group of three people was set up,where two of the people were confederates of the experimenter.When the confederates deliberately gave wrong answers,people were often swayed to give the wrong answer also. In fact, 75% of people gave at least one wrong answer, with some people conforming to peer pressure on every occasion. But why do people conform in this way?  In an easy task like this,  it seems that people do not want to step out of line with the prevailing opinion of the group. On more difficult tasks, people also conform because they lose onfidence in their own ability to make decisions and prefer to trust the majority opinion instead. A typical example of this kind of conformity arises when we come across people in distress. Would you help a woman who has been attacked in the street?It turns out that you are much more likely to go to her assistance if you are alone.When other people are also around,a diffusion of responsibility occurs.

      "question": "People who daydream are often thought of in negative terms, such as being lazy or not doing what they should be doing. However, scientists who study the brain have learned many interesting things from studying the brains of daydreamers. Far from being a waste of time, recent research has shown that daydreaming is a healthy and useful activity for all of our brains. To study the brain, scientists use special devices that scan the brain and show pictures of which parts of the brain are active at certain times. When a person is daydreaming, the device will show a distinct pattern of activity in the brain called the \"default\" mode of thinking. In the default mode, the top or outside part of the brain is very active. Actually, several regions of the brain are interacting in this mode. Some scientists describe this mode as a time when the brain focuses on itself rather than focusing on the environment around the person. Typically, this occurs when a person is doing simple, undemanding work or performing routine actions that don't need much attention, like walking to school or cooking simple foods. People tend to daydream during such activities. The importance of daydreaming lies in developing both creative and social skills. When the mind is not engaged in dealing with one's immediate situation or problem, then it is free to wander. A time of wandering allows the mind to create things. New inventions may be imagined, or possible solutions to a problem can be planned. For example, solutions to problems in relationships with other people may spring to mind. In fact, most daydreams involve situations with others. Perhaps these are daydreams based on past memories, or daydreams of what might be in the future. In either case, daydreams help us develop the appropriate skills we can use in real interactions with others. As brain specialist Dr. Marcus Raichle of Washington University explains: \"When you don't use a muscle, that muscle really isn't doing much. But when your brain is supposedly doing nothing and daydreaming, it's really doing a great amount.\" During the so-called \"resting state\" the brain isn't resting at all!

      "question": "Researchers found that compared with teens who spent much of their free time in front of TV sets, those who were physically active often had higher self-respect, better grades and were less likely to have risky behavior like taking drugs, smoking, or drinking.The findings, based on a national survey of nearly 12,000 middle and high school students, were published in a journal. \"Across the board, children who engaged in any kind of activity were belier off than kids who watched a lot of TV,\" said study co author professor Penny Gordon Larsen of the University of North Carolina. Other studies have linked certain content of television programs, such as violence and sex, to children's behavior.But beyond this issue, Gordon-Larsen said that kids who spend hours watching TV \"miss opportunities\" to develop skills, learn teamwork and have other experiences that their more active peers benefit from. That doesn't mean, however, that kids have to be on the football team. The study found that some activities like skating and skateboarding----which adults sometimes frown upon----were also related to better self respect and less risk taking. That skaters were better behaved than TV watchers might come as a surprise to some adults who consider these teens to be bad, according to Gordon-Larsen.Skateboarding is forbidden in many public areas, and some communities oppose building skating parks.But if kids who like to skate have nowhere to do it, \"it's a shame,\" said Gordon-Larsen. Not only should parents encourage their kids to engage iii the physical activities they enjoy, she said, but schools and communities should also do more to create opportunities for children to be active.

Eastburn has no arms or legs and yet is an inspirational speaker and find still manage to achieve tremendous things. They rise above their weaknesses and do not allow limit their possibilities. I attended a school prize-giving ceremony not so long ago and the guest speaker was Andrew Becroft, who had a severe stutter as a child. Instead of allowing this to limit him, he chose to work hard to overcome it. He is now the Principal Youth Court Judge for New Zealand. Not only did he become successful, but he did so in a profession where he had to speak in front of others regularly where his weakness is front and center for all to see. If he hadn't worked on his speaking ability, it would have been very limiting to his life and career prospects. You can find similar people on New Zealand News channels, and I suspect the same in other countries. There are a number of presenters and reporters who have a noticeably unusual manner of speaking. Perhaps they have a peculiar accent or pitch of voice. These people have succeeded in spite of what would appear to be a weakness in their profession. Lots of people face far more significant limitations than you do. They may be missing limbs or are born into extreme poverty.

It was the timer's clock she would see at the end of her Olympic swim and it always had her world-record-breaking time on it. In his pre-shot routine, Tiger Woods never varies the number of practice swings or intensity of his concentration.The pre-shot routine is always the same so that the stroke will always be the same.

Friends and mates allow us to enjoy our success and our joys, comfort us in our challenging moments, and provide a mirror for us to learn more about ourselves. I've always looked at friends as the family we choose. They enrich our lives. As Robert Louis Steven once said, \"A friend is a present which you give yourself.\"    To be a good friend or partner, it's importable be a good listener. Hear what your friend or mate has to say first rather than jumping to conclusions or getting defensive. Sometimes it is useful to be their mirror, for when they hear their words repeated back to them, it can help them to realize that what they said was not exactly what they meant to say.    Patience, compassion and empathy are also important traits in being a good friend or partner. You know the old golden rule, \"Care for others the way you would like them to care for you.\" The support of a friend during a tough time could make the difference between success and failure. Encouragement and confidence are priceless gifts that can help change a person's life.

      "question": "Conservationists have unveiled plans to preserve and protect the world's most important species of coral, in a response to increasing threats that they say will lead to \"functional extinction\" within decades. Led by scientists at the Zoological Society of London, the Edge Coral Reefs project has identified 10 coral species in most urgent risk of becoming extinct.The scientists say that reefs are under pressure from a variety of threats including rising sea temperatures due to climatic instability, increased acidity , overfishing and pollution. The Edge plan, which focuses on the most evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species , will take a regional approach to conservation.This means focusing on the \"coral triangle\" around the Philippines, the West Indian Ocean around the Mozambique channel, and in the Caribbean channel. \"Coral reefs are threatened with functional extinction in the next 20-50 years, due predominantly to global climatic instability,\" said Catherine Head, coordinator of the reefs project.\"In these regions, we'll be supporting and training in-country conservationists to carry out research and implement targeted conservation actions,\" she said.\"Their projects will last initially for two years.We provide them with a whole host of tools to carry out their projects including funding and intensive training.\" She added. Coral reefs are the planet's most diverse marine ecosystem , known as the rainforests of the oceans.Despite taking up under 0.2% of the ocean floor, they provide food and shelter for almost a third of all sea life.If we lose the ecosystems, we lose not only the biodiversity  , but we also lose the capability of people to obtain income and food from coral reefs. Climatic instability, which leads to rising sea temperatures, causes corals to bleach.Bleaching occurs when sea temperatures rise and this causes the coral tissue to expel their symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae - these are what give the coral their colour.Bleached corals often die if the stress continues.Among the 10 species chosen to start the Edge project are the pearl bubble coral, a food source for the hawksbill turtle, and the Mushroom coral, which supports at least 15 brightly colored fish.

He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed  and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day. However, the unconscious part expresses itself through its own logic and its own language.. It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first.

      "question": "My grandson, Daniel, and I have always been very close. When Daniel's father remarried after a divorce, Daniel, who was eleven, and his little sister, Kristie, came to live with us. My husband and I were more than happy to have kids in the house again. Things were going along just fine until the diabetes   I've lived with most of my adult life started affecting my eyes, and then more seriously, my kidneys  . Then everything seemed to fall apart. Three times a week, I had to go to the hospital to be hooked up to a dialysis machine  . I was living, but I couldn't really call it a life -- it was an existence. I had no energy. I dragged myself through daily chores and slept as much as I could. My sense of humor seemed to disappear. Daniel, seventeen by then, was really affected by the change in me. He tried as hard as he could to make me laugh, to bring back the grandma who loved to clown around   with him. Even in my sorry state, Daniel could still bring a smile to my face. But things were not improving. After a year on dialysis, my condition was deteriorating   and the doctors felt that if I didn't receive a kidney transplant within six months, I would surely die. No one told Daniel this, but he knew -- he said all he had to do was look after me. To top it off, as my condition worsened, there was a chance that I would become too weak to have the transplant surgery at all, and then there would be nothing they could do for me. So we started the tense and desperate wait for a kidney. I was adamant   that I didn't want a kidney from anyone I knew. I would wait until an appropriate kidney became available, or I would literally die waiting. But Daniel had other plans. The time that he took me to my dialysis appointments, he did a little secret research on his own. Then he announced his intention to me. \"Grandma, I'm giving you one of my kidneys. I'm young and I'm healthy ...\" He paused. He could see I wasn't at all happy with his offer. He continued, almost in whisper, \"And most of all, I couldn't stand it if you weren't around.\" His face wore an expression of appeal mixed with determination. He can be as stubborn as a mule   once he decides on something -- but I've been told many times that I can out-stubborn any mule! We argued. I couldn't let him do it. We both knew that if he gave up his kidney, he would also give up his life's dream; to play football. It was all he ever talked about. And he was good, too. Daniel was co-captain and star defensive tackle   of his high school team; he expected to apply for a football scholarship and was looking forward to playing college football. He just loved the sport. \"How can I let you throw away the thing that means the most to you?\" I pleaded with him. \"Grandma,\" he said softly, \"compared to your life, football means nothing to me.\" After that, I couldn't argue anymore. So we agreed to see if he was a good donor   match, and then we'd discuss it further. When the tests came back, they showed Daniel was a perfect match. That was it. I knew I wasn't going to win that argument, so we scheduled the transplant. Both surgeries went smoothly. As soon as I came out of the anesthesia   , I could tell things were different. I felt great! The nurses in the intensive care unit had to keep telling me to lie back and be quiet -- I wasn't supposed to be that lively! I was afraid to go to sleep, for fear I would break the spell   and wake up the way I had been before. But the good feeling didn't go away, and I spent the evening joking and laughing with anyone who would listen. It was so wonderful to feel alive again. The next day they moved me out of ICU and onto the floor where Daniel was recuperating   three doors away. His grandfather helped him walk down to see me as soon as I was moved into my room. When we saw each other, we did not know what to say. Holding hands, we just sat there and looked at each other for a long time, overwhelmed by the deep feeling of love that connected us. Finally, he spoke, \"Was it worthwhile, grandma?\" I laughed a little ruefully  . \"It was for me! But was it for you?\" I asked him. He nodded and smiled at me. \"I've got my grandma back.\" And I have my life back. It still amazes me. Every morning, when I wake up, I thank God --and Daniel -- for this miracle. A miracle born of the purest love. How did grandma feel when Daniel announced his intention to give her one of his kidneys?",

      "question": "Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our own Milky Way and in other galaxies. This is a major achievement because,in   terms,planets are very small and do not give out light. Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove  _ more difficult. The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. In our own solar system,for example,Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. Only the Earth provides ideal conditions,and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve .     Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its \"sun\". Imagine a star up to twenty times larger, brighter and hotter than our own sun. A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. On the contrary, if the star were small,the life--supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. But how would we fund such a planet? At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life.  _ .      It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth--based telescopes. Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. Even a telescope in orbit round the earth like the very successful Hubble telescope,would not be suitable because of the dust particles in our solar system. A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. Once we detected a planet,we would have to find a way of blocking out the light from its star, so that we would be able to \"see\" the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life,rather than \"little green men\" . The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. As Earth-dwellers,we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. But this hope only exists in science fiction. If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet,it would completely change our view of ourselves. As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed,\"Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human efforts or thought would be unchanged by it.\" What do we know about the kind of planet,other than our own,that might be able to support life?",

Today's advertisements, or ads, try to get consumers to buy certain brands. Writers of advertising are so skillful that they can, sometimes persuade a consumer to wear a certain kind of clothing, eat a special kind of cereal, or see a movie. Consumers might never even want a product if they did not see or hear advertisements for it. For example, you probab1y do not need the newest cereal in the supermarket. There are probably many cereal brands on your kitchen shelves. You may not have space on a shelf for another. But if you see ads about a new cereal that is your extra-tasty and has a free prize in the box, you may want it. Advertising must get attention. To be effective, it must be exciting, entertaining, or provide some pleasure. The secret of writing good advertising copy is to offer a good idea as well as a product.

      "question": "Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today.  The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate  minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite  that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \"home.\" How did the scientists reach the finding?",

She poured her heart into her report and expressed her dream of becoming an airline pilot. Her paper came back with an \"F\" on it. The teacher told her it was a \"fairy tale\". Jean was heartbroken and ashamed. As the years went by, Jean was beaten down by the discouragement and negativity she encountered whenever she talked about her dream. \"Girls can't become airline pilots; never have, never will. You're crazy. That's impossible. \"Finally Jean gave up. In her senior year of high school, her English teacher was a Mrs. Dorothy Slaton, a demanding teacher with high standards. One day Mrs. Slaton asked this question: \"If you had unlimited finances, unlimited access to the finest schools, unlimited talents and abilities, what would you do?\" Jean felt a rush of the old enthusiasm, and with excitement she wrote down the very old dream. The next thing that Mrs. Slaton said changed the course of Jean's life. The teacher leaned forward over her desk and said, \"I have a little secret for you. You do have unlimited abilities and talents. When you leave school, if you don't go for your dreams, no one will do it for you. You can have what you want if you want it enough.\" The hurt and fear of years of discouragement disappeared all of a sudden. Jean felt thrilled and told her about her dream of becoming a pilot.

      "question": "Billie Holiday was an American jazz singer and songwriter. Nicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner, Lester Young, Holiday was a great influence on jazz and pop singing. Her voiced style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of controlling tempo  . Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and direct approach to singing. Billie Holiday was born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father, Clarence Halliday (Holiday), a musician, did not marry or live with her mother. Her mother had moved to Philadelphia when thirteen, after being driven away from her parents' home in Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore for becoming pregnant. With no support from her own parents, Holiday's mother arranged for the young Holiday to stay with her older married half sister, Eva Miller, who lived in Baltimore. During her final period of separation from her mother, Holiday began to perform the songs she learned while working in the brothel  . By early 1929, Holiday joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. In order to live, Holiday and her mother had to work there. Holiday had not yet turned fourteen at that time. On May 2, 1929, the house was raided  , and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending some time in a workhouse, her mother was released in July, followed by Holiday in October, at the age of 14. She co-wrote a few songs, and several of them have become jazz standards, notably God Bless the Child, Don't Explain, and Lady Sings the Blues. She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by others, including Easy Living and Strange Fruit. Her early career is hard to track down exactly. But, she later gained work singing in local jazz clubs before being spotted by a talent scout  , John Hammond, in 1933, aged 18. Her voice and recordings are loved for the depth of emotion and intensity she could bring to classic standards. Her range of voice was not the greatest, but, her extraordinary gravelly   voice was soon to become very famous and influential. She was an important icon of the jazz era and influential in the development of jazz singing. In the late 1930s she began singing a civil rights song called Strange Fruit--a song which told the tale of a lynching   of a black man in the deep south. It was very controversial for that period and it was not played on radios. It was recorded for Commodore records and she performed it many times over the next 20 years. In early 1959 she found out that she had cirrhosis   of the liver. The doctor told her to stop drinking, which she did for a short time, but soon returned to heavy drinking. By May she had lost twenty pounds, friends Leonard Feather, Joe Glaser, and Allan Morrison tried to get her to check into to a hospital, she put them off.  On May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York suffering from liver and heart disease. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying, and her hospital room was raided by authorities. Police officers were stationed at the door to her room. Holiday remained under police guard at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959.Billie Holiday had difficult life experiences which influenced her attitude towards life. She experienced many violent relationships. She also became increasingly dependent on various drugs which contributed to her early death in 1959, aged just 44.

You jump out of bed, rush into the shower, into your clothes and out the door with hardly a moment to think. A stressful journey to work gets your blood pressure climbing. Once at the office, you glance through the newspaper with depressing stories or reports of disasters. In that sort of mood, who can get down to work, particularly some creative, original problem-solving work? The way most of us spend our mornings is exactly opposite to the conditions that promote flexible, open-minded thinking. Imaginative ideas are most likely to come to us when we're unfocused. If you are one of those energetic morning people, your most inventive time comes in the early evening when you are relaxed. Sleepy people's lack of focus leads to an increase in creative problem solving. By not giving yourself time to tune into your wandering mind, you're missing out on the surprising solutions it may offer. The trip you take to work doesn't help, either. The stress slows down the speed with which signals travel between neurons  , making inspirations less likely to occur. And while we all should read a lot about what's going on in the world, it would not make you feel good for sure, so put that news website or newspaper aside until after the day's work is done. So what would our mornings look like if we wanted to start them with a full capacity for creative problem solving? We'd set the alarm a few minutes early and lie awake in bed, following our thoughts where they lead.

      "question": "Farmers, especially in developing countries, are often criticized for cutting down forests. But a new study suggests that many farmers recognize the value of keeping trees. Researchers using satellite images found at least ten percent tree cover on more than one billion hectares of farmland. That is almost half the farmland in the world. Earlier estimates were much lower but incomplete. The authors of the new study say it may still underestimate the true extent worldwide. The study found the most tree cover in South America. Next comes Africa south of the Sahara, followed by Southeast Asia. North Africa and West Asia have the least. The study found that climate conditions alone could not explain the amount of tree cover in different areas. Nor could the size of nearby populations, meaning people and trees can live together. There are areas with few trees but also few people, and areas with many trees and many people. The findings suggest that things like land rights, markets or government policies can influence tree planting and protection. Dennis Garrity, who heads the World Agroforestry Center, says farmers are acting on their own to protect and plant trees. The problem, he says, is that policy makers and planners have been slow to recognize this and to support such efforts. The satellite images may not show what the farmers are using the trees for, but trees provide nuts, fruit, wood and other products. They also help prevent soil loss and protect water supplies. Even under drought conditions, trees can often provide food and a way to earn money until the next growing season. Some trees act as natural fertilizers. They take nitrogen out of the air and put it in the soil. Scientists at the Center say the use of fertilizer trees can re-duce the need for chemical nitrogen by up to three-fourths.

It has an area of 37, 3 square kilometers. It became a World Heritage Site in 1988 because of its bird life.     All the four kinds of special land birds can only be seen on Henderson Island. There are also fifteen non-local seabirds. Other local things include nine kinds of plants, four kinds of land snails, and one butterfly. Although no people live on the island, archaeological   evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life.

      "question": "More than 30 million kids buy school lunch each day. This year, many schools raised lunch prices to fight raising costs. Students pay about $2 a meal now. That is 27 cents more than last year. But they still get a good deal. The average cost for schools to produce one meal has gone up 30 cents, and is now $3. So, how do schools neither make money nor lose money? To start, the government pays for a small part of the difference. Schools have to make up the rest. Peggy Eller, a leader of school nutrition   service in Hudson, Wisconsin, said her district is cutting costs by using fewer paper products and serving smaller portion . Well, portion control is one key to healthful eating! The push for more healthful food has grown in recent years. One in five kids aged 6 to 19 is overweight. Being overweight can cause health problems. Many states passed laws that require schools to serve nutritious meals. Since 2004, more than 90% of all U.S. Schools have removed the fat from lunches. Foods high in fat, salt and sugar have been replaced by low-fat milk, fresh fruits and vegetables. These new items on lunch menus have encouraged kids to change their eating habits. \"It makes easier to try new things at home, \"said Savanna Mackey, a Florida fifth-grader. Students need healthful meals to grow strong and do well in school. \"Rising prices won't stand in the way,\"says school nutritionist Jane Thornton. \"We'll just be more clever in how we do things.\" What can be inferred from the passage?",

      "question": "The Ministry of Education in Singapore is releasing a new book this month that summarizes the thinking behind the model method for teaching math.The approach has drawn interest from many comers of the world thanks to the country's top performance on international exams.Last night, education officials and researchers from the US and Singapore highlighted some key differences between the two systems. Singapore's method is highly visual and explores fewer topics, but in greater depth.While Singapore's text books have an average of 34 lessons with 15 pages of explanation for each, much bulkier texts in the US include an average of 157 lessons, with about four pages of explanation per lesson.There arc some more surprising differences. Professional development is intensive for all teachers in Singapore, but strangely about half of the elementary teachers do not have university degrees.That is certain to change, though, as education standards for entering teachers are increasing, said Madame Low, the director of curriculum, planning and development with Singapore's Ministry of Education.\" Starting salaries for math teachers match public sector accountants or engineers.Teachers are treated as professionals,\" added Madame Low. Mentoring programs for new teachers in Singapore last five years! Teacher evaluations there are extremely comprehensive, and teachers who succeed receive bonuses worth one to three months of salary.Grades one and two have smaller class sizes--only 30 students.Students are taught in English, not their native tongue.Many are bilingual or trilingual. People often ask, how applicable is a successful model in Singapore to the more diverse and much larger US? I'm also interested in the practical challenges.Given that books in the US are written with state standards and assessments in mind, matching them up with another country's approach might be tough.

      "question": "Zhao Wenxuan,a film star from Taiwan,has been fond of seeing films since his childhood. He would sometimes go to the cinema for the same film four or five times. He also enjoys literature and art. Before he took the film acting as his career,he had worked in an airline in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan Province. His change of job to acting was quite by chance. One day,he came across in the paper an advertisement for a leading actor to appear in the film named \"Wedding Feast.\" Full of excitement,he answered the job ad by telephoning the director of the film -- Mr. Li An. It was this telephone call that had changed all his life. At last the director decided him to be the very person for the role. That he could be chosen owed much to his good command of English,natural manners and low pay for his work in the film. The film \"Wedding Feast\" proved to be a hit. It won the German Golden Bear Award and entered the competition for one of the Oscar Academy Awards. Also, it was the first Taiwan film that was permitted to be shown in the U. S. Thanks to the film,Zhao Wenxuan became popular in Taiwan, Hong Kong and southeast Asia. In 1994,Mr. Zhao acted as a leading role in the Hong Kong film,\"Red Rose and White Rose\",in which many film stars like Ms Chen Chong from U. S. and Ms Ye Yuqing from the local area participated. This film was named for 10 prizes of the Taiwan Golden Horse Prize and at last it was awarded five prizes for the best play,actress and music. Zhao has regarded the film as one of his favorite films since he stepped into the acting circle. Since 1993,Mr. Zhao has taken part in the shootings of 13 films, most of which are thought highly of. Mr. Zhao said the that Taiwan should think to cooperate much with the mainland in the film producing industry and it would benefit each other.

A CV   is the only way to get a job. To tell the truth, many employers don't like or actually read CVs.Some employers would prefer to judge a person after a face-to-face meeting, or give them some part-time work first to see what they are truly like in the workplace. Having an up-to-date CV is important when applying for jobs advertised in the paper, from larger organizations, or when you want to leave some information about yourself for the employers. I have to make my decision now and stick to it. There is a great saying: \"Life is a journey not a destination.\" Journeys are full of options.You make and change your decisions all the time based on new experiences and information. Yes, you do have to make decisions, but you do not have to be limited by those career decisions by sticking to them.What's more important is having a go and exploring new things. I can't get into the work I like because there are too few opportunities. I have no doubt getting into work that you really want to do can be challenging.But I do also believe opportunities exist in most career areas because employment needs change all the time.One strategy I'd suggest if you can't get your dream job is to go after what you want and grab any opportunity that moves you toward your dream job. It's the school's responsibility to talk about careers and work. Schools do have a part to play in providing career advice for students, but others also have a responsibility.I would suggest that a student-parent-school partnership approach is a far better way of looking at this.A lot of information is available on the internet, in the newspapers, through relatives and friends.

Mr. John Evans had never found the time or money to make the trip from his home in Forest Fach, near Swansea.

He arrived at Paddington Station and smartly turned out in his best suit, favorite Panama hat and a red rose in his buttonhole. \"It's very exciting. There's no doubt about it,\" he said.

Besides, there are many good universities, too. Also you need to think about your likes and dislikes and then research the different areas. You like sunshine and hate snow?

      "question": "Once upon a time, science fiction was just a style among other styles. There were crime stories, there were horror stories, there was literary fiction-and there was science fiction. But today science themes dominate these other styles. It's difficult to think of much modern crime, horror or \"serious\" fiction that doesn't involve science. And it's not just books. With every second movie and computer game having a sci-fi element, science fiction seems to have controlled our entire entertainment culture. It's clear that if we want to define science fiction we should relate it to the role that science plays in our lives. Perhaps the place to start is by noting when it began. Although some experts have claimed to be able to trace sci-fi back to ancient times, it is more plausible to find it in initial form in the 19th century, when industrial societies arose. One of the features that set industrial societies apart from other kinds was the increasing part that science played in everyday life. Factories with vast machines turned out huge quantities of goods, which were transported by trains, motor vehicles and ships all over the world. Cities were built on the back of technology, with electricity in homes and hospitals helping everyone to lead healthier, more convenient lives. All of these changes had great effects not only on people's real lives, but on their imaginative ones. Writers began to articulate these changing physical and mental landscapes, eventually giving science fiction a large and devoted fan base of especially young readers, who found that it spoke to their curiosity about the future that science would create. But sci-fi reflected fears about science more than it did hopes. These typical early science fiction novel might be a UK novel like H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (1897). With great skill, Wells played upon the fears of technology by imagining Earth under threat by a civilization -that of men from Mars. The science fiction of today expresses the impact of the computing revolution, robotics and our environmental challenges, while it is less concerned with \"little green men from Mars\" and other themes of past sci-fi. Given that science, technology and politics are always intertwined  , contemporary science fiction often has a great deal to say about power. Many recent novels - like American Cory Doctorow's Little Brother (2008) - are concerned with government and security service \"conspiracies  \" against the people, particularly as the revelations of whistleblowers like Edward Snowden sink in. This can give sci-fi writing a \"skeptical\" feel. This underlines one of the features that remains constant between the beginnings of the empire of science fiction and its state today. As then, so now: We want to read about how fearful the future will be, not how it will be a paradise  . What caused science fiction to appear in the 19th century?",

He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock.

      "question": "In a moment of personal crisis, how much help can you expect from a New York taxi driver? I began studying this question and answers are interesting. One morning, I got into three different taxis and announced,\"Well,it's my first day back in New York in seven years.I've been in prison.\"Not a single driver replied,so I tried again.\"Yeah,I shot a man in Reno.\"I explained, hoping the driver would ask me why, but nobody asked.The only response came from a Ghanaian driver,\"Reno? That is in Nevada?\" Taxi drivers were uniform sympathetic when I said I'd just been fired.\"This is America,\"a Haitian driver said.\"One door is closed.Another is open.\"He argued against my plan to burn down my boss' s house.A Pakistani driver even turned down a chance to profit from my loss of hope;he refused to take me to the middle of the George Washington Bridge--a $20 trip.\"Why do you want to go there? Go home and relax.Don't worry.Take a new job.\" One very hot weekday in July, while wearing a red ski mask and holding a stuffed pillowcase with the word \"BANK\" on it, I tried calling a taxi five times outside different banks.The driver picked me up every time.My ride with a Haitian driver was typical of the superb assistance I received. \"Let's go across the park,\" I said.\"I just robbed the bank there.I got $25,000.\" \"$25,000?\" he asked. \"Yeah,you think it was wrong to take it?\" \"No, man.I work 8 hours and I don't make almost $70.If I can do that,I will do it too.\" As we approached 86th and Lexington, I pointed to the Chemical Bank. \"Hey,there is another bank,\"I said,\"Could you wait here a minute while I go inside?\" \"No,I can't wait.Pay me now.\" His unwillingness may have had something to do with money--taxi drivers think the rate for waiting time is too low--but I think he wanted me to learn that even a bank robber can't expect unconditional support. Why did the Pakistani driver refuse to take the author to the middle of the George Washington Bridge?",

      "question": "On Saturday August 12, 2000, during Northern Fleet training exercises in the Barents Sea, the Russian nuclear submarine  Kursk sank in about 100 meters of water with some 118 sailors aboard. It's known later that several officers were also aboard, observing the training exercises. The Kursk is lying on the ocean floor in the Barents Sea. The Russian Navy said that it was listing 30 degrees to port. Other sources reported it was listing as much 60 as degrees. According to a Russian newspaper, when the submarine Kursk failed to make contact with the naval command at the right time later that day, Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Vyachesav Popov ordered rescue ships into the area. It took hours to find the submarine, as it didn't launch  a marking buoy  before sinking. Russian Navy Chief insisted that the submarine Kursk had been involved  in a major collision , but a great deal of information shows that this is not true. Up till now, it's believed that an explosion in the torpedo compartment  in the nose of the Kursk was the likely cause. Now Russian government officially asked Norway for help in recovering of sailors' bodies first of all, and Norway has agreed to offer all help. But Russian insisted that only Russians work inside the submarine Kursk and that the work last for about 10~18 working days. It is expected to recover only 25~35 bodies from the Kursk. It was not until October 25, when a team of Russian divers entered the submarine Kursk, some 350 feet below the surface, that truth became clear. On November 7, in the morning, owing to   the icy and the cold weather, a special rescue meeting held on Murmansk decided to stop the whole bodies recovering operation. Why did Russia insist that only Russian divers can work inside the submarine Kursk?",
      "options": {

Soon after I arrived, I realized the importance of getting a part time job to make a living. Deciding to do this on my own, I spent a whole day going from door to door for a job. However, I received a little or no reply. This became my daily activity after college for a few weeks. One afternoon, I walked into a building to ask if there were any job chances. The people there were very surprised, and advised me not to continue my job search in that way. As I was about to leave, a secretary in the building came up to me and encouraged me to stay confident. He then offered to take me to the Royal Oak area to search for a job. Along the way, I realized I had run out of copies of my resume  . The man stopped at his friend's office to make me 15 extra copies. He also gave me tips on dressing and speaking. I handed out my resume and went home.

So the king asked to search for it and put a reward for$50,000 for anyone who found it. One day, a clerk was walking home along a river when he saw something shinning in the river and when he looked, he saw the diamond necklace. He decided to try and catch it to get the $50,000 reward. He put his hand in the river and tried to catch the necklace, but somehow missed it and didn't catch it. He took his hand out and looked again and the necklace was still there. He tried again. But strangely, he still missed the necklace! He came out and started walking away, feeling sad. Just then, an old man walking by saw him, and asked him what was the matter. The clerk didn't want to share the secret with him, thinking he might take the necklace for himself, so he refused to tell him anything. The old man could see this man was troubled. He again asked the clerk to tell him the problem and promised that he would not tell anyone about it. The clerk told him about the necklace and how he tried and tried to catch it, but kept failing. The old man then told him that perhaps he should try looking upward, toward the branches of the tree, instead of in the river.

Today, they want risk and excitement -- the closer to the edge, the better. They snowboard over cliff and hike deep mountains. Extreme sports started as an alternative to more expensive sports such as golf. A city kid who couldn't afford expensive sports equipment could get a skateboard and have fun. But now it has become a whole new area of sports, with specialized equipment and high levels of skill. There is even an Olympics for extreme sports, called the winter x-game, which includes snow mountain hiking and ice climbing. What makes extreme sports so popular? Maybe it's because people love the risk. City people want to be outdoors on the weekends and do something challenging. The new equipment is so much better that people can take more risks without getting hurt. Sure there's a risk. Once you go mountain hiking or snowboarding, it's impossible to go back to have riding or skiing. It's just too boring. Now even the older crowd is starting to join in. Every weekend, groups of friends in their early 30s get together. On weekdays they work as computer programmers in the same office. On weekends they hike mountains together.

      "question": "In his earlier books, David Burke, a famous writer, translated the language of American teenagers for an older generation, and explained American idioms for English-language learners overseas. His latest effort targets American children who know little of foreign languages. He has written a series of books based on the observation that fairy tales are widely known across cultures. \"We start in English, and as the reader moves forward, the story starts to change into another language.\" (INSTRUCTION CD: \"Once upon a time, there lived a poor girl--nvhaizi--named Cinderella  who was very pretty--piaoliang. The nvhaizi, who was very piaoliang....\") Burke has published books of fairy tales with CDs in Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, Hebrew, Japanese and Spanish. A separate Spanish-language version helps teach English to Lain American youngsters. Young readers learn about 20 words at each level, then move to the next level as they read a different fairy tale. \"For example, I've taken the story of Goldilocks , and I bring back all the words the kids have learned in Cinderella, and I add 20 more until the ninth level. By the end of the entire series, it will be 100 percent in the target language.\" Burke says students often think of language learning as dull, but it doesn't have to be. He designed his books with color1ful cartoon-like illustrations  that attract the young readers. He says many people in other parts of the world often speak at least two languages. Americans have a different reputation. \"It's a joke in the linguistic  world that's painful, and funny. It's, What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual.  And what do you call a person who speaks two languages? Bilingual. And what do you call a person who speaks one language?

      "question": "Everyone knows how the story of Cinderella ends, but did you ever really think about how she spent her days before she met the prince? Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, \"Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?\" she probably would have answered, \"Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!\" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams   ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled   and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do.

Our communication skills even matter when we are in traffic and we need to make a decision about how to respond to other drivers. Communicating with others becomes inseparable from having a good day, or a bad day not only in how we begin communication, but in how we react to the communications of others who are having a difficult time. It can make a difference in saving a marriage or getting a divorce, celebrating a rise or getting fired, and even having your eggs cooked as the way you like at the local restaurant. Many wise men and women have stressed the importance of dealing with others in a skillful manner. Getting feedback  from others can be of great value in improving our interpersonal communication skills. Often, however, others are not skilled at giving feedback. When we get negative results, they rarely include the details we need in order to improve our interpersonal skills.

      "question": "World's Best Places to Visit We hope the following places can help you choose where to go on your next vacation. Zurich   From swimming in Lake Zurich in summer to skiing the Alps in winter, Zurich attracts visitors year-round. As a fairytale city, Zurich is set on the banks of both a river and a lake, with the snow-topped Swiss Alps rising in the background. Clean cobblestone streets hug a hilly land and medieval   church tops reach heavenward. Despite its reputation for being the center of old-school international banking and a capital for chocolate, Zurich is also a very modern city that chooses to enjoy life at an unhurried pace. Travelers desiring a real experience should strive to do the same. The City of Angels  The City of Angels, the Entertainment Capital of the World--Los Angeles needs no introduction. But its notoriety   both helps and hurts its reputation. The traffic on the \"101\" will tire you out just as much as an evening at a lively West Hollywood club. And your dislike at the thick smog over the city will ruin your enjoyment of a sunset overlooking Santa Monica Beach. To appreciate Los Angeles, visit the area more than once and get advice from locals. Prague   A prosperous and busy city, Prague now attracts more tourists than ever. But its picturesque downtown veils   both a dark legacy and a resilient   past; in its 1,100 years, Prague has survived numerous overthrows, invasions, fires and floods. It's this reputation for survival and perseverance that has made the Czech capital so fascinating. Today, its storied churches, narrow streets, hilltop castle and statue-lined bridges create the scene of an urban fairy tale. Even the most tired traveler would have trouble resisting this city's charms. Puerto Rico   Pick a vacation experience you're looking for, and Puerto Rico can help. Puerto Rico is an old town with a lot of historic architecture and cobblestone streets. Look no further than Old San Juan and its El Morro fortress.Consider the bioluminescent   bays of Culebra and Vieques. Puerto Rico is a global destination with high-end shopping and exciting nightlife. Yellowstone   More than 3,000 square miles of nature's finest canyons, hot springs and rocky cliffs are an easy sell for outdoors enthusiasts. Geothermic   wonders like the Mammoth Hot Springs, Old Faithful and Yellowstone Lake are not to be missed at this national park. With dramatic peaks and lakes, Yellowstone is an outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Multicolor1ed pools go around hot springs; green forests weave past wide meadows; and hot springs launch streams of steaming water toward the sky. With so much unspoiled natural beauty, there's no doubt that the park is indeed extraordinary. While you go across the park's 3,000-plus square miles of mountains, canyons, and waterfalls, be prepared to share the trails with permanent residents like buffalo, elk and sometimes even grizzlies.

      "question": "Most city parks are places where you can escape from big, ugly structures of metal and stone. The Manhattan High Line is different. Raised 25 feet above the ground, this large metal structure once supported a rail line. The line opened in 1934 to bring trains directly into factories. It was hardly used after the 1960s, and much of it was torn down. However, one part remained in a region of Manhattan called Chelsea. Chelsea was becoming high-class as restaurants, art galleries and apartments were built, but the ugly railway structure remained as _ . Everyone knew that at some time, it would have to be removed. But the High Line was not destroyed. In fact, now the old rail line serves as one of the most peaceful places in the city. It holds an elevated  park, with beautiful gardens and great views of the city. The idea to turn the rail line into a park came from Joshua David and Robert Hammond. In 1999, they attended a meeting to decide how to deal with the High Line. David and Hammond were the only people at the meeting interested in saving the historical structure. Later on, when they asked railway officials to take them up to look at the High Line, they saw a mile and a half of wild flowers growing in the middle of the city, and they realized that the High Line had potential  to become a park. There was growing interest in improving city centers, and so the project quickly developed and money for construction was easily collected. The first section of the High Line opened in 2009 and immediately became popular with tourists and locals alike. Each part of the park has a different atmosphere. Some areas are like balconies  with wonderful city views. Where the rail line goes between buildings, trees are thickly planted. Other sections have wide lawns  and walkways planted with wild flowers. Only the final section remains the way it has been for the last fifty years.

      "question": "When Beijing is hit by smog, residents often joke that the Chinese capital needs to build giant fans to clear out the polluted air.Mountains to the north and west help trap smog in the city, and a strong wind from Mongolia is the surest way to ensure cleaner air. Beijing officials are now considering ways to help that process.Though giant fans are not on the menu, at least not yet, city planners are looking at ways to create corridors  that encourage wind flow through the capital.The plan is inspired by research on urban heat islands, which shows that large buildings that block the wind are one of the causes of higher average temperatures in cities as opposed to those in the countryside. \"This isn't controlling pollution.It's shifting the problem.\" Wang Bing, a Beijing-based author, wrote on Sina Weibo.But the plan has received some interest from residents who have grown tired of repeated periods of heavy pollution. Peng Yingdeng, an air pollution expert at the Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, told the newspaper that the plan was more likely to require an adjustment of related laws to limit building heights and numbers in some areas.Similar proposals are under consideration in other major Chinese cities including Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang and Wuhan. \"This kind of work to search for ways to reduce pollution is really worth applauding,\" the state-run news agency Xinhua said in a commentary.\"If scientists confirm it is effective, then we should promote it on a much larger scale.\" Some experts have expressed doubts whether the plan would make a significant difference.Serious pollution is usually associated with periods of little or no wind, and air corridors do little good if the wind isn't blowing, Song Guojun, an environmental science professor told The Beijing News.Solving the air pollution problem mainly requires controlling pollution sources.

      "question": "The phone ID flashed, \"Emergency Vet\". \"Oh no\" I whispered. I could not lose Merlin now. Ron and I had tried to have children for a long time with depressing results. I threw myself into my work. Any maternal feelings I had were spent on Merlin. I couldn't wait to get home from work each night. I wanted to pick up that warm bundle of loving fur and nestle him. I wanted to sing \"Rock-a-bye Merlin\", as I did every night as he would put his paws around my neck. Merlin was my comfort especially at times when I wondered if God was listening. But last night something had changed. Not only did I sing \"Rock-a-Bye Merlin\", but I asked, \"What will I do after you're gone?\" Although Merlin was 19 years old, a senior in the age of a cat, he didn't look or act that way. I didn't want to accept the fact that he was nearing the end of his lifetime. My job at the law firm was so demanding and stressful that I couldn't imagine getting through the day without Merlin waiting to greet me at home. I dialed the vet's number. I asked for my husband but he already left. Then I took a breath and asked the question that no one wants to ask, \"Is my Merlin still alive?\" The nurse said \"yes.\" Ron came home and said that Merlin had almost no red blood cells left. White blood cells were replacing them. Merlin would need expensive transfusions most likely on a monthly basis. We both knew Merlin was running out of time. I asked Ron to drive me to the vet so I could say goodbye to my little boy cat but he was beat tired and it was late. Ron said if Merlin was still alive the next morning then he would take me to the vet.  _ Merlin had survived the night. After driving to the vet, I went into the examining room. The nurse brought Merlin and placed him on an examining table on his side. His eyes were tightly shut. I thought he died already. I carefully edged my hand to reach his body. His body felt warm, but when I spoke his name there was no response. No response to his name or that I was there and that I loved him. I was extremely sad. In that examining room I felt helpless. I wondered how many people in an examining room felt as helpless as I did. Feeling driven to prayer I yelled, \"God this isn't good enough. I need to see my Merlin the way I remember him, I need a miracle and I need it now!\" At that moment, God granted a miracle. Merlin's favorite compliment entered my mind. I said, \"Merlin, You are Beautiful and You are Gorgeous, do you hear me?\" One eye opened. I said \"Gotcha\". I kept repeating those words. Merlin opened the other eye and, one limb at a time, got up. He was waiting for that phrase. He wanted to hear that he was beautiful and gorgeous again. Then I experienced another miracle. There was no sound in that examining room until Merlin started walking to me. From out of nowhere, or maybe from heaven, I clearly heard a song we sung in church often: \"It Is Well With My Soul.\" I remembered thinking, \"Yes, it is well with my Soul. I got to see my little boy cat one more time.\" Merlin walked to me. He put his face in mine, which he had never done before. He rubbed a circle around my face twice. Merlin said goodbye with his face and marked me for life. Ron appeared shocked that Merlin was up and had walked to me. I said to Merlin, \"Tell God you are a good boy and how much we love you\" and then handed him back to the nurse. Tears of gratitude poured forth in memory of a miracle. You see for nineteen years God spoke to me through a special cat named \"Merlin.\" On Merlin's last day, God proved he heard me when he granted a miracle. That miracle gave me time to say goodbye.

      "question": "If you want to stay young,sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise, and as a result,we are ageing unnecessarily soon.  Professor Taijiu Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern prefix = st1 /Japanappeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a  ly early age, and how the process of ageing could be slowed down. With a team of partners at Tokyo National University,he set about studying the brain volumes  of a thousand people of different ages and various jobs.  Computer technology enabled the researchers to get exact measurement of the volume  of the front and side sections of the brain,which relate to intellect and feelings,and determine the human character. The back section of the brain,which controls functions like eating or breathing,does not connect with age. One can continue living without intellectual or feeling abilities.  Contraction of front and side parts - as cells die off - was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not obvious in some sixty and seventy year olds.  Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple cure for the contraction normally connected with age using the brain.  The findings show in general conditions that contraction of the brain begins soon among people in the country than in the town. Those are at least at risk,says Matsuzawa,who are lawyers,followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing regular work in government offices are, however,as likely to have shrink   as the farm workers,bus drivers and shop assistants.  Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must flow through a circle properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. \"The best way to keep good blood movement is through using the brain,\"he says. \" Think hard and engage in conversation.

We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, for man is slowly changing all the time. Let us take an obvious example. Man, even five hundred years ago , was shorter than he is today. Now, on average,  men are about three inches taller. Five hundred years is a relatively short period of time, so we may assume that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modem world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still make use of only about 20% of the brain' s capacity . As time goes on , however , we shall have to use our brains more and more,  and eventually we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring about a physical change too: the head, in particular the forehead, will grow larger. Nowadays our eyes are in constant use. In fact , we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a very long period of time it is likely that man' s eyes will grow stronger. On the other hand, we tend to make less use of our arms and legs. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however , our fingers will grow more sensitive  because they are used a great deal in modern life. But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both sexes are likely to be bald.

      "question": "Education plays a very important role in everybody's life. We go to school because we want to know more about the world around us. The typical classroom used to be the place where teachers and students were working and exploring the wonderful world of knowledge together, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one of those approaches. Learning via the Internet is a new style that seems to become successful than the traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a large amount of learning material that is accessible to students online. Owing to the choices of courses online, completing a program becomes much easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spend hours searching for the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, being a first time mother, I find that using information online is very helpful. While I am at home with my baby, I can still search for the material I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my house. The Internet is not only a big information provider but also a money and time saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future because of Internet access to information. The cost of land, building and wages for teachers are continuously increasing. In addition, regular courses (offline) depend heavily on books and other paper-based materials, while online education posts lectures, and assignments electronically, which saves thousands of dollars every year. With no physical restrictions, the Internet classes and courses are also very convenient. In classroom-based education there is a limitation on the number of students while Internet education is available to everyone. Students don't have to struggle in order to register for classes they like.  Students will have more choices to take their courses and classes online. The Internet offers a wonderful opportunity to obtain knowledge in a more convenient and less expensive way. In my opinion, online life in the future is simply inescapable.

Place: Comedy Theatre The Children's Hour The Children's Hour by Lillian Hellman is a striking play about the power of a lie. Karen Wright (Keira Knightley) and Martha Dobie (Elisabeth Moss) run a girls' boarding school in the 1930s New England. When an angry student starts a rumour that the two headmistresses are having a lesbian   affair, it gradually destroys the women's careers, relationships and lives. The Children's Hour is an upsetting story of cheat, shame and courage. Banned in London and several cities across America, The Children's Hour received its world opening on Broadway in 1934. Generations on, its exploration of a culture of fear remains remarkably relevant. Keira Knightley and Elisabeth Moss Star Keira Knightley, nominee   for Best Actress 2010 Evening Standard Awards for The Misanthrope, returns to the London stage. Knightley starred in Love Actually, The Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy, Pride and Prejudice. Elisabeth Moss, best-known for playing Peggy Olson in Mad Men, made her Broadway stage debut   in David Mamet's Speed the Plow in 2008. The Children's Hour will be her West End debut.

Another expression is\"hold your tongue.\"It means to be still and not talk.\"Hold your tongue\"is not something you would tell a friend.But a parent or teacher might use the expression to quiet a noisy child. \"Hold out\"is an expression one hears often in sports reports and labor news.It means to refuse to play or work.Professional football and baseball players\"hold out\" if their team refuses to pay them what they think they are worth. The expression\"hold up\" has several different meanings.One is a robbery.A man with a gun may say,\"This is a hold up.Give me your money.\"Another meaning is to delay.A driver who was held up by heavy traffic might be late for work.Another meaning is for a story to be considered true after an investigation.A story can hold up if it is proved true. \"Hold on\"is another expression,which means wait or stop.As you leave for school,your brother may say,\"Hold on,you forgot your book.\" It is used to ask a telephone caller to wait and not hang up his telephone.

It is the hardest way to remember English words. How do you learn to speak Chinese? You did it by listening carefully to the people talking to each other. You can find radio programs, TV programs and records, and listen to them carefully. The best way to learn all new words is through ear. As you listen to more and more dialogues, you will learn how English is pronounced in phrases and sentences. Of course, it is not enough to learn new words; you must learn how words are put together, and why some words in English are emphasized. 2. Some people have found that they can learn the names of everyday objects, such as box, cup, desk and so on, in the following way. They write the names of subjects, they say the words.

      "question": "Zoology is the part of science that deals with the study of the animals' growth, home and behavior. It has nothing to do with people, so many students are left wondering why they have to learn it. Our nature includes not just humans but plants and animals as well. Everything in our environment is connected in a complex cycle. If you have a better understanding of how animals would behave and work with us, then you would value nature better. Some animals are actually misunderstood by people like sharks and snakes. These creatures are thought of as human killers, and this is mainly because we don't understand why they behave that way. In zoology you would be able to learn natural behavior as well as their homes so you would completely understand why they would behave in a defensive  manner when they seem to be threatened. Studying zoology would help people achieve clearness over the common myths we have on different wild animals. Studying zoology would help people know the real facts about animals. One of the negative facts is the decreasing numbers of some species of animals. It makes people realize that there is a need for nature to be always balanced. We need animals to keep the balance in our environment and for humans to survive as well. It would help us learn the needs that animals lack and we can respond by thinking of solutions we can give to the endangered species of animals. Modern progress is needed for a country to grow in terms of its economy; however, it should not force us to destroy our rainforests and oceans. People should realize that our modern lives should include the lives of the animals that live with us. They should not be contained in zoos but in their natural homes as well. We will learn that every living creature on the earth has the right to own a home and we need to fight for them to have permanent  homes. The best title for the passage may be \"  _  \".",

      "question": "The world has changed and being intelligent isn't normally equal to being a successful person. Look at the example of the blue whale: it has a huge brain, but it still doesn't know how to avoid whalers or use its large size and weight to deal with those who try to use their body for profit. Scientists hold an opinion that the blue whale is just like some highly intelligent people who fail to succeed. Those highly intelligent people can't succeed in life because they can't communicate well with the world around them. Intelligence is a word in life that makes you think you are better than others. Intelligence can blind these very people from how others view them. These people also think that the route to power and success results purely from intelligence and they sometimes live in a fantasy world that they create by their supposed brain power.  This is a distance that develops whether or not they realize it and sometimes, a person can be disliked simply because of his or her intelligence. This distance is sometimes so far apart that it gets to the position where they can't listen to each other. One side thinks the other is stupid and the other thinks he/she is haughty . And most of the time it is the intelligent people who lose themselves in this situation. They become unpopular with most of the people around them. This affects them in whatever they do and sooner or later they will lose their confidence.  It doesn't help that they get a culture shock --- especially when they leave college and realize success and richness don't always and sometimes never come naturally with intelligence.

      "question": "Wisconsin has long been home to incredibly successful research and innovation thanks to our famous academic research institutions and some of the brightest scientific minds. From discovering how Vitamin D can best be absorbed, to unlocking the potential of stem cells, Wisconsin has pioneered remarkable breakthroughs in science that have improved health, saved lives and created jobs. These scientific breakthroughs have not only led to life-saving medical technologies but also have fostered   a strong power in Wisconsin economy. Across America, groundbreaking research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone adds millions of dollars to our economy every year. In fact, NIH funding generated an estimated $58 billion in economic output nationwide in 2014. NIH funding spurs economic growth by supporting jobs in research and by generating biomedical innovations that are turned into new products. NIH-supported innovations also influence improvements in health that can bolster the economy, improve productivity, and reduce illness and disability at home and across the globe. But, budget cuts and inadequate funding for NIH in the past decade have put both medical innovation and our next generation of researchers at risk. Today, too many of our talented young scientists are deciding to do something else, or are leaving the country to pursue their research. Simply put, scientific and medical innovation depends on our ability to foster, support and invest in these new researchers. That is why I have worked across party lines with Senator Susan Collins of Maine and introduced the Next Generation (NextGen) Researchers Act. Our act builds opportunities for new researchers, helps address the debt burden that young scientists face today, and invests in the future of research, science, and innovation. This commonsense proposal would create the \"Next Generation Researchers Initiative\" within the NIH Office of the Director to coordinate   all current and new NIH policies. The legislation   also directs the NIH to consider recommendations from a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) comprehensive study and report on fostering the next generation of researchers. Finally, we must demonstrate a commitment to our future scientists who, like so many of their peers pursuing other fields, are struggling with crushing student loan debt. Our plan would also increase the amount of loans that can be forgiven through the NIH's loan repayment programs to better account for the current debt load of new scientists. Higher education should be a path to prosperity, not suffocating debt, and this provision not only helps make higher education more affordable, but can help give new researchers a fair shot at pursuing their dreams. The Next Gen Researchers Act will help to empower our next generation of researchers from Maine to Wisconsin, and across our country, with the resources they need to continue to lead the world in groundbreaking biomedical research and development. I'm proud to have earned the support of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Medical College of Wisconsin, and many others, for my bipartisan work supporting Wisconsin's leadership in science, research and innovation. At a time when America's young researchers are facing the worst funding in decades, our best and brightest minds deserve to know that our country stands with them and is committed to building a stronger future.

      "question": "A new report says more and more international students are attending colleges and universities in the United States. It also notes a large increase in the number of international students form China. These findings are from the latest edition  of the Open Doors Report.    The report tells the record number of international students in the United States during the 2011-2012 school year. It says more than 764,400 such students were attending American colleges and universities during that period. That means an increase of almost 6% compared to one year earlier. By comparison  ,the number of Americans who are studying overseas increased by 1%.    The report says 194,000 students at American colleges and universities are from China. That is an increase of more than 23% over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal is an assistant to the president of the Institute of International Education. She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America.\" We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world that they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their destination of choice.\" She says.    Chinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities .

South Korea is third with about 70,000 students.    Why do so many foreign students study in the United States ? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason. \" The advantage America has is that we have a huge system and a very diverse   system.

So the man decided to help the butterfly.He cut off the remaining bit of the cocoon so that the butterfly would come out easily.But to his surprise, the butterfly got a heavy body and very small wings when it came out of the cocoon. The man continued to watch the butterfly because he expected that the body would grow smaller at any moment and the wings would become larger and be able to fly.But neither happened! In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a heavy body and small wings.It was never able to fly. The man was in his kindness, but he didn't understand the nature rules.Before the butterfly came out of the cocoon, fluid  from its body must be forced into its wings, and then would be ready for flying.It must have a hard struggle  to get through the small opening to get its freedom from the cocoon.

Earlier this year, I had dinner in a mud hut in Ethiopia, where we sat on chairs next to the hostess's bed --- a home that had more warmth than any house I've been in since. Now John Edwards is exploring what makes a house a home in his just-released Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. There Edwards writes, \"This is a book about homes, the values they rest on, the dreams they are filled with, and the people they have shaped. The houses and circumstances are different, but much of what you find inside will be familiar.\"  Whether you're sitting in an airport right now, waiting to fly to your childhood home for Thanksgiving, or in your own home waiting for the  s to arrive, you know what he's talking about.

It's where friends sit on the kitchen counter drinking wine while dinner is being fixed. I lived there for only 18 years, but it will always be my true home. Even the lamp in the west living room window, which I could see far down the road when driving home late at night, still shines.

      "question": "The common cold is the world's most widespread illness, which is plagues  that flesh receives. The most widespread mistake of all is that colds are caused by cold. They are not. They are caused by viruses  passing on from person to person. You catch a cold by coming into contact, directly or indirectly, with someone who already has one. If cold causes colds, it would be reasonable to expect the Eskimos to suffer from them forever. But they do not. And in isolated Arctic regions explorers have reported being free from colds until coming into contact again with infected people from the outside world by way of packages and mail dropped from airplanes. During the First World War soldiers who spent long periods in the trenches , cold and wet, showed no increased tendency to catch colds. In the Second World War prisoners at the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp , naked and starving, were astonished to find that they seldom had colds. At the Common Cold Research Unit in England, volunteers took part in Experiments in which they gave themselves to the discomforts of being cold and wet for long stretches of time. After taking hot baths, they put on bathing suits, allowed themselves to be with cold water, and then stood about dripping wet in drafty room. Some wore wet socks all day while others exercised in the rain until close to exhaustion. Not one of the volunteers came down with a cold unless a cold virus was actually dropped in his nose. If, then, cold and wet have nothing to do with catching colds, why are they more frequent in the winter? Despite the most pains--taking research, no one has yet found the answer. One explanation offered by scientists is that people tend to stay together indoors more in cold weather than at other times, and this makes it easier for cold viruses to be passed on. No one has yet found a cure for the cold. There are drugs and pain suppressors  such as aspirin, but all they do is to relieve the symptoms .

Laster and Watts expect this year to be just as productive as last year.After 4 months, they are on pace to exceed last year' s sales by more than $70,000.Each year the head office awards the owners of the store achieving the highest sales with a weekend stay at the best hotel in Kansas City and tickets to a Kansas City Chiefs football game.However, due to the extremely good sales performance of the store in Truman, the head office decided to change the tradition.Laster and Watts said their staff, which consists of only 5 university students, would be joining them in Kansas city as well.

      "question": "On the night of July 6, 1943, a plane took off from an Air Force base in England to stop German fighters over the English Channel. Piloting the plane was Captain Thomas Nash. Looking westward, Nash saw twelve orange lights in a row, moving at a very high rate of speed. Thinking they might be a new German weapon, he swung the plane around and headed directly for the lights, but they disappeared. Captain Nash may have been the first to see such orange lights but he wasn't the last. His experience was repeated many times by pilots during World War II both in England and Far East. What were they? No one knows for sure, but there is an interesting theory to explain them. According to this theory, the orange lights are space animals---animals specially adapted   to life in the upper atmosphere just as some living things are adapted to life at the bottom of the sea. These space animals, the theory says, live so far up in the atmosphere that they are not in sight from the earth. They feed partly on the air and partly on energy from the sunlight. Being almost pure energy themselves, their body shine at night. During the day, however, they are invisible. Before World War II, continues the theory, there was little radiated energy on the earth's surface. Then came the development of rockets, nuclear power stations and something like that. The space animals are attracted to these kinds of energy of food. At night when there is no energy from the sunlight, they come down into the lower levels in search of a meal. They may even float into the range of human eyesight. This explains the fact that they have been sighted many times from the earth since 1943. The theory says that during the daytime the space animals   _  .",

      "question": "Psychologists  have known that what's going on inside our head affects our senses. For example, poorer children think coins are larger than they are, and hungry people think pictures of food are brighter. Professor Remi Radel wanted to investigate(look into) how this happens -- whether it's right away, as the brain receives signals from the eyes, or a little later, as the brain's higher-level thinking processes get involved. Radel chose 42 students and each student was told to arrive at the lab at noon after three or four hours of not eating on the day of the test. Then they were told there was a delay. Some were told to come back in 10 minutes; others were given an hour to get lunch. So half the students were hungry when they did the experiment and the other half had just eaten. For the experiment, the participant looked at a computer screen. One by one, 80 words flashed on the screen. A quarter of the words were food-related. After each word, the person was asked how bright the word was and asked to choose which of two words they'd seen -- a food-related word like gateau (cake) or a neutral   word like bateau (boat). Hungry people saw the food-related words as brighter and were better at identifying food-related words. Because the word appeared too quickly for them to be reliably seen, this means that the difference is in perception  , Radel says--it's not because of some kind of processing happening in the brain after you've already figured out what you're looking at. \"This is something great to me, that humans can really realize what they need or what they hope for, to know that our brain can really arrange for our motives and needs,\" Radel says. \"There is something inside us that selects information in the world to make life easier.\" Which of the following is true about the experiment?",

      "question": "Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand (  ) of hair, a technique that could help track the movements of criminal suspects or unidentified murder victims.    The method relies on measuring how chemical variations in drinking water show up in people's hair.    \"You're what you eat and drink, and that's recorded in your hair,\" said Thure Cerling, a geologist at the University of Utah.   While U.S. diet is  ly identical, water supplies vary. The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as rain clouds move.    Most hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable, but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes (  ). The heaviest rain falls first. As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah.    Similar patterns exist throughout the U.S. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months. Cerling's team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a map of the regional difference. They checked the accuracy of the map by testing 200 hair samples collected from 65 barber shops. They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad region roughly corresponding to the movement of rain systems.    \"It's not good for pinpointing (  ),\" Cerling said. \"It's good for eliminating many possibilities.\"    Todd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near Great Salt Lake. The woman was 5 feet tall. Police recovered 26 bones, a T-shirt and several strands of hair. When Park heard about the research, he gave the hair samples to the researches. Chemical testing showed that over the two years before her death, she moved about every two months. She stayed in the Northwest, although the test could not be more specific than somewhere between eastern Oregon and western Wyoming.    \"It's still a substantial area,\" Park said, \"But it narrows its way down for me.\" What is said about the rainfall in America's West?",

      "question": "If you are looking to putting a tree in your home for Christmas, there is always one debate that seems to arise in most households: whether you want a real tree or fake tree. Year after year, as we find ourselves cleaning old pine needles   for months on end, we decide that we will never get another real tree. So that begs the question: Which kind of tree is better? There is certainly a lot to be said for real trees. There is something fun about gathering the family together, going to a Christmas tree farm, and selecting or even cutting down your own tree. Real Christmas trees have that lovely holiday pine needle smell and they look great in your home. Of course, on the other hand, they also leave a complete mess behind and needles that seem to keep appearing for weeks or even months after the tree comes down. You must also find a way to deal with your real Christmas tree after you're done, which may mean cutting it into pieces so it will fit in the trash. Many dustmen will refuse to take away a tree that is left beside your regular trash, especially if it is a big tree or an old, yellow one with falling needles, making it hard to pick up. They don't want a face full of sharp needles any more than you do! With a fake Christmas tree, there is no mess, but there is also no Christmas smell and no exciting trip to the Christmas tree farm. Of course, these trees look the same in appearance as a real tree when decorated. _ For some people, a can of pine air freshener is enough to recreate the pleasant smell of a real tree. As to which tree is the better choice, it is really a matter of personal preference. Both real and fake trees certainly have their benefits, and knowing which is better for you this Christmas really depends on what your family wants.

As a preschooler can tell you, repetition can lead to pleasure. When you experience something more than once, you notice more details about it each time, and it increases your enjoyment. That's why you love revisiting that jazz club, favourite restaurant, and beloved old Woody Allen movie. Of course, you can overdo it. Don't buy boxed sets of DVDs. Economist  Tyler says that much of the joy we get from our buying lies in the experience of finding them out, getting them home, and opening them up. If you receive 18 DVDs in one package, you'll use up the excitement all at once. Buy things one a time and space out the pleasure. Look outside. People long ago spent almost all of their time outside with trees, water, and sky around. The world in which most of us spend our time nowadays is unnatural and can harm the spirit. Even being close to nature for a short time can make us happy.  _ . Physical contact with animals works wonders. You can pet an animal. It increases the brain chemicals connected with pleasure and decreases those connected with stress . Even people without pets can get some of the effect by hanging out for a few minutes at a dog shelter. Smile. Well, like it or not, smiling improves your mood. Here's why: people react better to you when you look happy, which in turn leads you to be happy. What's more, looking happy fools your brain into thinking that you are happy.

Carlos Pardo from Colombia's Sustainable Urban Transport Project said, \"World Car Free Day is not only a celebration of fun ways to get around the city, but a demonstration of traffic-free streets and clean air is possible. But we do not want just one day of celebration and then a return to normal life. When people get out of their cars, they should stay out of their cars. It is up to us, our cities and our governments to help create lasting change to benefit walkers, cyclists and other people who do not drive cars. \"     Car-free days were organized as early as during the 1970s, and several car-free days were organized in European cities during the early 1990s.

      "question": "It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, CA. Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous.  On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car.  While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude. If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else.  This kindness spreads. Someone does something nice for you and in turn you're likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else.  A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect.

Whether it could or not, some people are worrying about the possibility that phones, power lines and Wi-Fi could be responsible for a range of illnesses, from rashes to brain tumors. Some say there is evidence to support the growing anxieties. David Carpenter, a professor of environmental health sciences at the university at Albany, in New York, thinks there's a greater than 95 percent chance that power lines can cause childhood leukemia . Also there's a greater than 90 percent chance that cell phones can cause brain tumors. \"It's apparent now that there's a real risk, \" said Carpenter. But others believe these concerns are unjustified. Dr Martha Linet, the head of radiation epidemiology  at the US National Cancer Institute, has looked at the same research as Carpenter but has reached a different conclusion. \"I don't support warning labels for cell phones, \" said Linet. \"We don't have the evidence that there's much danger. \" Studies so far suggest a weak connection between EMFs  and illness-- so weak that it might not exist at all. A multinational investigation of cell phones and brain cancer, in 13 countries outside the US, has been underway for several years. It's funded in part by the European Union, in part by a cell phone industry group.

      "question": "Nora, a 17-year-old American, notices that when she has to do a paper for school and researches it on the Internet, she rarely reads a whole page and does deep reading. \"I'll read the beginning of a paragraph and then I'll skip  the rest,\" she says. While Nora's mother, Martha, loves sitting down with a good book and reading carefully, her daughter may be the wave of the future. \"Deep reading\", or slow reading, is a process in which people think carefully while they read. With most, that means slowing down --- even stopping and rereading a page or paragraph to really understand what the author is trying to say. Last summer, Google CEO Eric Schmidt said he was concerned about what he sees as a decline in slow reading. Instant messages and 140-character tweets appear to be reducing out ability to concentrate on a single idea or theme of a book, he told Foreign Policy Magazine. It's easy to forget the benefits of deep reading in an age when anything worth doing is done fast. Experts warn that without deep reading, it is impossible to be an educated person of the world, a knowledgeable voter or even an imaginative thinker. \"If you want to have a deep relationship with a text and understand a complex idea, then slow reading is a preferred style. It is good for pleasure, too. It is not a rushed experience and you can lose yourself in a text,\" said Canadian writer John Miedema, the author of the book Slow Reading. US' Ohlone College English professor Cynthia Lee Katona says reading is a highly social activity that builds the mind and social connections.

      "question": "More than 200 scientists have completed a twoyear study to identify the most natural and undeveloped areas on Earth. Their findings are reported in a new book called Wilderness:Earth's Last Wild Places. The book describes 37 wilderness areas around the world. Each has an area greater than 10,000 square kilometers. The study considered only areas where at least 70% of all plants are native. North and South America are home to the largest number of wilderness areas. There are 16 such areas, from southern Argentina to Alaska and northern Canada. Africa has 8 wilderness areas, including the thick forests and the grasslands. Australia and New Guinea   share 6 areas. Europe has 3 areas and Asia has 2.The Arabian Desert and Antarctica also are considered wilderness areas. The largest wilderness area is the Boreal Forest  .It extends for 16million square kilometers south of the Arctic Circle. The Boreal Forest extends across Alaska, Canada, northern Europe and Russia. The smallest of the 37 wilderness areas is the Sundarbans. It is the world's largest tidal mangrove forest  .It covers 10,000 square kilometers of land at the mouth of the Ganges River in India and Bangladesh  . The study found that wilderness areas cover about 46% of the Earth's land surface. However, they are home to less than 2.5% of the world's population. Nineteen of the wilderness areas have only about one person for each square kilometer. Native people usually live in these areas. Wilderness areas help to influence the world's weather systems and rainfall. They are also home to many plants and animals. Population growth and the spread of agriculture and mining operations threaten wilderness areas. But just 7% of all such areas have some form of official protection.

My husband and I stayed with him for the weekend but had to return to our jobs on Monday. Local relatives would help Dad get home from hospital and look after him. But I longed to be able to let him know that we cared about him too, even when we weren't with him. Then I remembered a family tradition when our children were small. When leaving our grandparents' home after a visit, each child would write a love note to their grandparents. We hid notes in a box, under a hairbrush or next to the phone or even in the microwave oven. For days, our grandparents would smile as they discovered these reminders of our love. So as I tidied Dad's kitchen and made up a bed for him downstairs in the living room, I wrote some notes. Some were practical, \"Dad, I put the food in the fridge so it wouldn't spoil\". Some expressed my love, \"Dad, I hope you will sleep well in your new bed.\" Most notes were downstairs where he would stay for several weeks until he recovered strength, but one note I hid upstairs under his pillow, \"Dad, if you have found this note, you must be feeling better. We are so glad!\" Just like his medicine strengthened him physically, these \"emotional vitamins\" would improve his spiritual health.

KTD uses a mix of hip-hop, jazz, blues and classic rock to make a sound of their own. \"KTD simply mixes most, if not all of my favourite music styles,\" said Kamia Jones, as Chicago high school student.\"I like that they aren't afraid to be different and that their music is real and speaks to the soul.\" The band formed two years ago.

One day, he gathered up all his strength and decided to attend a job interview. His appointment was at 10 am and it was already 8:30. While waiting for a bus to the office where he was supposed to be interviewed, he saw an elderly man wildly kicking the tyre of his car. Obviously there was something wrong with the car. Jimmy immediately went up to lend him a hand. When Jimmy finished working on the car, the old man asked him how much he should pay for the service. Jimmy said there was no need to pay him; he just helped someone in need, and he had to rush for an interview. Then the old man said, \"Well, I could take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please, I insist.\" Jimmy agreed. Upon arrival, Jimmy found a long line of applicants waiting to be interviewed. Jimmy still had some grease on him after the car repair, but he did not have much time to wash it off or have a change of shirt. One by one, the applicants left the interviewer's office with disappointed look on their faces. Finally his name was called. The interviewer was sitting on a large chair facing the office window. Rocking the chair back and forth, he asked, \"Do you really need to be interviewed?\" Jimmy's heart sank. \"With the way I look now, how could I possibly pass this interview?\" he thought to himself.

Smart home technology will allow all sorts of electronics and appliances  to be able to communicate with each other and perform various tasks. Whenever someone wants to have a snack, but does not feel like making something, why not have the refrigerator suggest something based on what it has inside of it. Not only that, it would communicate with the microwave to prepare the cooking power and time for that particular dish.    Nearly all major appliances in the future will take advantage of this technology through home networks and the Internet. Smart home technology is a way for ordinary electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, consumers, and even manufacturers. Many consider a smart home to be one that is networked. Others feel it is a home that has appliances that will allow the consumer to do little or no work, but a smart home really is all of that combined, and more.

      "question": "Last year, Jack Bleed cut through the bone of his ring finger while working. The 31-year-old resident of North Little Rock, Arkansas, waited for about six hours at a nearby medical center while the medical staff there called all over town -- even as far away as Dallas and Memphis -- to find a hand surgeon to reattach his finger. Finally, a willing doctor was located in Louisville, Kentucky. But even though Bleed had insurance , he would have to hire a private plane to get himself there, at a cost of $4,300. In the end, he charged the cost to two credit cards, and his finger was saved. His insurance company eventually covered the cost of the plane, but his experience makes people aware of the fact that trauma  care in the United States is not only geographically limited, but in many places, non-existent. Only eight states -- New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, New Mexico, California, Oregon, and Washington -- have local, fully functional trauma systems. The remaining states have partial systems, and 12 -- including Arkansas -- have no trauma system at all. Although the President has signed a bill of $12 million for the purpose of supporting trauma care systems nationwide, many in Congress  are unwilling to spend government money for a service they think should be paid for by states, says Wayne Meredith, medical director for trauma programs at the American College of Surgeons. Meanwhile, many states have also failed to find the dollars to support trauma systems. To make matters worse, many people without insurance depend heavily on the emergency care services, placing a huge financial burden on the medical centers that serve them. For the same reason, doctors, too, often go unpaid. They are unwilling to perform emergency care, worsening critical shortages of neurosurgeons, orthopedists, and hand surgeons -- the very types of specialists Bleed needed at short notice. Supporting a trauma care system doesn't take much. A half-penny sales tax in Miami-Dade County makes its outstanding system work. In Arkansas alone, says Wayne Meredith, a well-funded trauma system would possibly prevent 200 to 600 deaths each year. If trauma care systems were to work well across the nation, experts say, many thousands of lives each year could be saved. \"You don't get much better return on your investment than that,\" Meredith says.

My main goal was to relax in preparation for the challenges of my retirement in the coming year. Through my stay in Montreal, I met lots of Chinese who are struggling to succeed and then lead a better life in Canada. Some travelled thousands of miles to get knowledge. When I spoke with some of them about the major barrier they had to face after they arrived in Canada, they all talked about the two official languages of Canada. But I was impressed by their ability to express their ideas while switching between English and French. Almost all of those people said they often felt homesick. They miss their families and friends. Though Montreal has lots of Chinese restaurants, they long for a home-cooked meal. I met some tourists who were trying to realize their childhood dreams of experiencing the life in a developed country. When I asked them if Montreal had lived up to their expectations, they hesitated. They said that reality never agrees with fantasies. However, they were glad to have the opportunity to visit Montreal and didn't regret taking the trip. Not all the Chinese people I met were happy. I once met a young lady who met with a gentleman through the Internet. However, to her disappointment, he disappeared after he promised to marry her in Montreal. I was served by another Chinese person who could not handle the challenges of studying in an English environment and ended up working in a restaurant with minimum pay. Exploring different parts of the world, without any doubt, is an enriching experience. However, one should be realistic when it comes to leaving his hometown to set up a new life in a foreign country.

      "question": "Have you ever wondered what goes through your mind when you choose where to sit in a new classroom? Or in a waiting room full of strangers? Or on a bus? Researchers have found out some interesting facts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we prefer to sit closer to people like ourselves. Girls sit by girls and boys sit by boys. Adults sit together and young people choose another young person to sit near. But it goes further than this. We even choose to sit near someone who looks like us. People with glasses are more likely to sit near other people with glasses. People with long hair sit closer to other people with long hair. We seem to believe that people with similar habits or hobbies will share similar attitude and we are more likely to be accepted by people like ourselves or even, we think we may be safer with people who look like us. Sometimes that's true but it's a pity if we always stick to the same people, the same group. The danger in always staying in our comfort zone  is that we just recycle the same opinions, the same tastes and the same ideas. We lose the chance to learn something new, find out about interesting things, hear funny stories and discover difference. When we always stick to the same people, how can we ever break down the barriers which prevent us from getting to know people with different ideas?

During school,her parents took her to Italy to explore the country's many cultural treasures. One of the private art collections Isabella visited in Milan had a deep influence on her. She wrote to her friends about her dream of owning a house one day with an art collection like the one she had seen in Italy. In Paris, Isabella became a close friend of one of her classmates, Julia Gardner, whose family was from Boston. Julia would later introduce Isabella to her brother, Jack. In 1860, Isabella Stewart married Jack Gardner. The couple had too much art to fit inside their home. So they decided to start planning a museum. Mrs. Gardner didn't like the cold and empty spaces of many museums during her time. She wanted a warm museum filled with light. She once said that she decided years ago that _ . America was a young country developing quickly in other areas. But the country needed more chances for people to see beautiful examples of art. After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised  every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston.

      "question": "Regarded as one of the English language's most gifted poets, John Keats wrote poetry that concentrated on imagery, human nature, and philosophy. Although Keats didn't receive much formal literary education, his own studies and passion brought him much success. Additionally, his own life situation influenced his poetry greatly. Growing up as a young boy in London in a lower middle-class family, the young John didn't attend a private school, but went to a public one. His teachers and his family's friends regarded him as an optimistic boy who favored playing and fighting much more than minding his studies. After his father's death in the early 1800s, followed by his mother's passing due to tuberculosis  , he began viewing life differently. He wanted to escape the world and did so by reading anything he could get his hands on. At around the age of 16, the teenage John Keats began studying under a surgeon so that he too might become a doctor. However, his literary appetite had taken too much of his fancy, especially with his addiction to the poetry of Ehmund Spenser. He was able to have his first full poem published in the Examiner in 1816, entitled O Solitude! If I Must With Thee Dwell. Within two months in 1817, Keats had written an entire volume of poetry, but was sharply criticized by a magazine. However, the negative response didn't stop his pursuit of rhythm  . John Keats' next work was Endymion, which was published in May 1818. The story involves a shepherd who falls in love with the moon goddess and leads him on an adventure of one boy's hope to overcome the limitations of being human. Following Engymion, however, he tried something more narrative-based and wrote Isabella. During this time, John Keats began seeing his limitations in poetry due to his own limit in life experiences. He would have to have the \"knowledge\" associated with his poems. His next work was Hyperion that would attempt to combine all that he learned. However, a bout   with tuberculosis while visiting Italy would keep him from his work and eventually take his life in 1821. What do we know from the passage?",

      "question": "Vans, Keds, Dollies--they sound like the names of rock bands, but if you have teenagers, you'll know they're actually the latest in teenage footwear. But experts are now warning that the current shoe fashions will be causing teenagers discomfort in the short term and storing up years of foot, knee and back pain in the future. Here, the experts identify the problems caused by teenagers' shoe choice. KEDS/VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are particularly popular among teenage boys-with Keds and Vans the most sought-after brands. The main problem is that they are just too flat--so flat that the heel, which strikes the ground first, also becomes damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are such light and thin dolly shoes. The problem is partly their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However ballet pumps, which have no string or heel, have other specific problems. \"As the shoe has no fastening device, it relies on the toes to keep the shoe on, causing an awkward gait ,this leads to short-and long-term problems such as calluses ,heel and knee pain.\" WEDGES AND STILETTOS      These shoes can also cause problems with gait, They may look good, but the heels on these are so high they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teens who wear these shoes regularly are also in danger of joining those millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES      So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday wear? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a string to hold it on, with a small heel and a deep toe-box that does not press the toes, such as Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing 'bad' shoes, get them some simple foot orthotics in the shoes. These support and correct the movement of the foot and, properly fitted by a podiatrist, can often transform their walk and halt the damage. From this passage we can infer_.",

His wife, Gerrie, was still working in the local school cafeteria, but it was hard for Dave to find work, and the price of everything was rising. The Fusses were at risk of joining the millions of Americans who have lost their homes in recent years. Then Dave and Gerrie received a timely gift--$7,000, a legacy  from their neighbors Ish and Arlene Hatch, who died in an accident. \"It really made a difference when we were meeting difficulty .\"says Dave. But the Fusses weren't the only folks in Alto and the neighboring town of Lowell to receive unexpected legacy from the Hatches. Dozens of other families were touched by what the Hatches had done. In some cases, it was a few thousand dollars; in others, it was more than $100,000. It surprised nearly everyone that the Hatches had so much money, more than $3 million--they were an elderly couple who lived in an old house on what was left of the family farm. Children of the Great Depression, Ish and Arlene were known for their habit of saving. They preferred comparison shopping and would go from store to store, checking prices before making a new purchase. Through the years, the Hatches paid for local children to attend summer camps when their parents couldn't afford it. \"Ish and Arlene never asked if you needed anything,\" says their friend Sandy Van Weelden, \"They could see things they could do to make you happier, and they would do them.\" Even more extraordinary was that the Hatches gave away their farmland.

Plastics are used today in everything. Scientists wanted to find a way to make objects made of plastic last longer. The researchers hope their new discovery can be used to make objects that are difficult or impossible to replace. The surface of plastic objects breaks over time. Very small breaks develop every time a plastic object is used. The researchers wanted to find out how to stop plastic from developing small breaks that weaken and destroy it. They found the answer in the chemical structure of plastic itself. The research team found a way to make plastic that contains very small balloons filled with monomer  liquid.  When the new plastic cracks, the monomer liquid is let out and flows into the crack. Thus the break is repaired. The repaired plastic has seventy-five percent of the strength of undamaged plastic. The new self-repairing plastic is not yet ready for production. But it has several possible uses. One could be in space vehicles where parts cannot be repaired or replaced.

In Japan, people use  _ in their directions instead of street names. For example, the Japanese will say to travelers, \"Go straight down to the corner. Turn left at the big hotel and go past a fruit market. The post office is across from the bus stop.\"      In the countryside of the American Midwest, usually there are not many landmarks. There are no mountains, so the land is very flat . In many places there are no towns or buildings within miles. Instead of landmarks, people will tell you directions and distance. In Kansas or Iowa, for example, people will say, \"Go north two miles. Turn east, and then go another mile.\" People in Los Angeles, California, have no idea of distance on the map: They measure distance by means of time, not miles. \"How far away is the post office?\" you ask. \"Oh,\" they answer, \"It's about five minutes from here.\" You say, \"Yes, but how many miles away is it?\" They don't know.

It wasn't the only instance of anti-Semitism   that Kaminer, 17, of Hall High School in Connecticut, says she witnessed at her school. There were other comments, like a boy asking two other students in her class if they were Jewish. When they replied that they weren't, he said, \"Oh, good.\" Kaminer recalled. He patted them on their backs and said, \"You're one of us.\" Kaminer, who is Jewish, said she was hurt by the remark, and after a while she got tired of seeing such comments swept under the rug . So she decided to take action. After reaching out to the administration and connecting with social studies department supervisor Stephen Armstrong, Kaminer and Armstrong put together a class on anti-Semitism. They presented it to every ninth-grade social studies class during the last week of school this year. In the class, Kaminer and Armstrong showed a clip from the ABC show, What Would You Do? where actors portrayed a Jewish couple and a bakery employee who yelled at them with anti-Semitic comments. They had class discussions about what stereotypes  students had heard. \"I was a little surprised and confused by how much of this still goes on at Hall.\" Armstrong said. \"That's why we're doing this. Although students are taught about the Holocaust   in history classes, it's a pity that kids are seldom asked to think about this topic in a present-day situation.\" \"The fact that a teenager was teaching her fellow students made the class more effective.\" Armstrong said. \"I could have done it - a couple of classes I did it myself - but it was a lot more effective when a kid was with me.

      "question": "If you walk around any large city, you'll find a coffee shop on every corner. Many shops offer comfortable sofas, large screen televisions and sometimes even live music. More and more teenagers are hanging out there. My pre-teen has already done so after school once a month, but she always orders fruit juice. I think she would drink coffee sooner or later, so I started doing some research online. I found that coffee in moderation   could be safe, but one thing that was constant online was the chance of becoming addicted to coffee. Coffee is one step up from soda but still not as dangerous as energy drinks or alcohol. Still, any addiction is hard to break, so I needed to come up with a plan that would protect my child. Coffee shops offer a safe place for teenagers to hang out. As like anything else you let your children do, you need to set limits. Drinking coffee while socializing once or twice a week won't cause a severe caffeine addiction. However, you should avoid allowing a cup of coffee every morning and ensure they get adequate sleep each night, which will make them less likely to feel the need to drink coffee.

      "question": "It's such a shame to lose a free throw. Playing in the court has pressure from the opponent, time, your teammates, the audience, and yourself. You have to shoot the ball despite all the pressures around. But with a free throw, you have the ball, no one will try to get it from you, and you have all the time to shoot the ball. But why is it that many players, even good shooters, miss most of their free throws? Maybe they need more practice or maybe they need to apply more ways to improve their free throw. Improve your player or your free throwing skills by following the tips below: Make it personal. The truth is, there is no rule on how one should handle and throw the ball in a free throw. What matters is that the player should shoot the ball from the free throw line no matter how he does it. So when trying to improve your free throw shooting, better stick to what works the best for you. Do not copy other people's techniques. Make it your own and leave those techniques as theirs. Formulate   a repetitive way of shooting the ball. A free throw should be personalized. But it should also be repetitive. You should be able to repeat your free throw techniques whether you are in your court or in another court, whether you are energized or tired. You can't say you have a personal free throw technique if you can't repeat it over and over again. Shoot at the same position and distance for every free throw. Basketball courts may be located in different places or maybe marked with different paint colors. But all of these courts maintain the same distance from the _ to the free throw line. Familiarize your perfect position when making your free throws. That should help you do your perfect throw. Which of the following might serve as the best title of the above passage?",

He dropped out without graduating. Next, Charles' father sent him to school to become a minister . This time he made it to graduation, but he didn't want to do the work of a minister. His friends encouraged him to follow his interest in science. Luckily, Charles was invited to sail on the Beagle as an unpaid scientist after graduation.

It also provides children with a reading model. Reading aloud doesn't just benefit young children. Parents should continue reading aloud as their children grow because listening comprehension is more important than reading skills in middle school. Jim Trelease, in his Read-Aloud Handbook, has noted that almost as big a mistake as not reading to children at all is stopping too soon  Until about the eighth grade, children listen and comprehend on a higher level than their reading skills allow them to read independently, This means children can hear and understand stories that are more difficult and more interesting than anything they can read on their own If you want to join the activity, you're supposed to   _",

      "question": "The Internet can be a great way to connect with people. The latest web craze is social networking on websites such as MySpace. More than 65 million young people use online social networking sites. That cyberspace  trend is causing problems in school, however. In a recent survey, nearly 36 percent of school administrators said that social networking sites troubled learning in their districts. Should school districts ban sites like MySpace? Teachers are worried that some students use social networking to post personal information and to cyber bully  other students. One of the biggest dangers comes from people who find out kid's personal information. Many districts have blocked students from accessing or using social networking sites from school computers, and some have suspended  students for posting harmful material on those sites from their home computers. Nearly two-thirds of US kids have computers in their homes, according to the US Census Bureau. \"It is important to keep in mind that just blocking access to social web sites at school is not the end of the story,\" warns NSBA executive director Anne Bryant, \"Most of the misuse of these sites takes place at home but still affects the classroom.\"  _ . They say the main problem with sites like MySpace is that students don't understand the dangers involved in using them. \"Many students are posting personal information about themselves without regard to who has access to that information,\" Jim Hirsch said, \"Schools should focus on educating their students and their parents on how to be safe online.\" Experts argue that too many schools are forbidding students to use social networking web sites without thinking about their educational benefits. \"Social networking web sites can help connect students in the United States to their peers in other countries, providing invaluable lessons in foreign cultures,\" explains Hirsch.

Six of the top ten happiest jobs are based heavily on helping others, such as firefighters, teachers, and physical therapists( ). Being able to express oneself is also important for people to feel satisfied . Take authors as an example. Their pay is \"ridiculously low or non-existent\", but \"the freedom of writing down the contents of your own mind leads to happiness ,\"wrote business author Steve Denning on his blog on Forbes.com. These jobs are greatly different to the top ten \"hated jobs\", according a website survey earlier this year. Director of information technology, sales manager, technical specialist and others that are generally considered respectable jobs are on the list. Todd May from The New York Times didn't find the results strange. He argued that \" a meaningful life must, in some sense then , make people feel worthwhile\". If a person doesn't participate in the causes \" that are generally regarded as worthy, like feeding and clothing the poor, their life will lack meaning ,\"he said . Work takes up the greater part of most people's  lives . It's no wonder that the people with the most worthwhile jobs are the happiest of all. However, it's important to remember that these two surveys are broad ones and that it doesn't matter whether your dream job is on the two lists. Now it is the time to think about the future . After all, something that satisfies your mind will always bring you happiness. From the passage we learn that   _   .",

      "question": "Some people seem easy to understand: their character appears obvious on first meeting. Appearances, however, can be deceptive. I shrug my shoulders when people tell me that their first impressions of a person are always right. For my own part I find that the longer I know people, the more they puzzle me. I read in this morning's paper that Edward Hyde Burton had died. He was a businessman and he had been in business in Japan for many years. Once he gave me a great surprise. Unless I had heard the story from his own lips, I'd never have believed that he was capable of such an action. He was always neatly and quietly dressed in accordance with his age and position. He didn't talk much, but what he said was sensible. You couldn't imagine he'd possibly raise his voice in anger. Here was a man who attracted you because you felt in him a real love for his fellows. He'd tell with point a good and spicy story, and in his youth he'd been something of an athlete. He was a rich man and he'd made every penny himself. I suppose one thing that made you like him was that he was so weak; he aroused your instincts  of protection. You felt he couldn't bear to hurt a fly.               One afternoon Burton told me a \"funny\" story in a quiet, dry humour:               \"There was a namesake  of mine, who was the best bridge player I ever met. He  seemed to have a fantastic instinct about the cards. He won a good deal of my money by card-playing.\" \"One day he came to me when he lost all his fortune. He came to see me in my office and asked me for a job. I asked him how old he was.\" \" 'Thirty-five', he said.\"               \" 'And what have you been doing ever since ?' I asked him.\"               \" 'Well, nothing very much.' he said.\"               \" 'I'm afraid I can't do anything for you just yet' I said. 'Come back and see me in another thirty-five years, and I'll see what I can do.' \" \"He didn't move. He went rather pale. He hesitated for a moment and then he told me that he had had bad luck at cards for some time. He lost everything he had. He hadn't a penny. He was down and out. If he couldn't get something to do he'd not survive.\"  \"I looked at him for a bit. I could see now that he was all to pieces. He'd been drinking more than usual and he looked fifty.\"  \"Suddenly I had an idea.\" Pausing in his story, Burton turned to me. \"When I was young I swam over three miles round the beacon  and landed at the river of Tarumi. It's rather difficult on account of the currents round the beacon. Well, I told my young fellow about it and I said that if he'd do it I'd give him a job.\" \"I could see he was rather surprised. He was not in good condition for sports. He looked at me for a moment and then he nodded.\" \"I told him I'd drive round to the river at half past twelve and meet him.\"               \" 'Done,' he said.\" \"I wished him good luck and he left me. I had a lot of work to do that morning and I only just managed to get to the river Tarumi at half past twelve. But I needn't have hurried; he never turned up.\"               \"Did he fear it at the last moment?\" I asked. \"No, he didn't fear it. He started all right. But of course he'd ruined his constitution  by drink. The currents round the beacon were more than he could manage. We didn't get the body for about three days.\" I didn't say anything for a moment or two. I was rather shocked. Then I asked.               \"When you made him that offer of a job, did you know he'd be drowned?\"               He looked at me with his kind blue eyes, smiling. \"Well, I hadn't got a position in my office at the moment.\" Edward Burton could be described as a(n)     person.",

South Korea celebrates Valentine ' s Day, where local custom dictates women give gifts to men.     It has taken on a popular event born in Japan but sweeping Asia known as White Day on March 14 when men return the favor with gifts for women. But Black Day, on April 14, is a South Korean original. It is marked by people who have not found love dressing in dark color1s and commiserating    over meals of black food, with the dish of choice being Chinese-style noodles topped with a thick sauce of black bean paste.   \"I had a miserable time on Valentine ' s Day, felt even lonelier on White Day and now I' m crying over a bowl of' black noodles,\" said a young woman, \"Things better be different next year.     At universities across the country on Monday, students without lunch dates ordered black noodles, dined with other lonely hearts and searched for companionship, South Korea marketers have used special days for the 14th of each month to create a calendar full of love. Some days have gained attraction such as Black Day, while others such as Green Day in August, when couples are supposed to drink cheap wine that comes in green bottles and walk in the woods, have yet to attract much of a following. Black Day events have snowballed, with a major matchmaking service this year providing an evening of speed dating where the dish of choice is sushi blackened by squid ink. An on-line company for movie tickets sponsored a speed eating competition of black noodles for those who bought single tickets for the latest films. \"It is depressing enough going to the movies by yourself,\" said Shin Youn-joo of the company called Max Movie. \"We just wanted to spread a little joy to the singles .\" On February 14, men in South Korea may_.",

In the cold and the darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, wandered through the streets. It is true she had on a pair of slippers when she left home, but they were not of much use. They were very large, so large, indeed, that they had belonged to her mother, and the poor girl had lost them in running across the street to avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate. One of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other and ran away with it. So the little girl went on with her little naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In an old apron she carried a number of matches, and had a bunch of them in her hands. No one had bought anything of her the whole day, nor had any one given her even a penny. Lights were shining from every window, and there was a delicious smell of roast goose, for it was New-year's eve--yes, she remembered that. In a corner, between two houses, one of which projected beyond the other, she sank down and huddled herself together. She had drawn her little feet under her, but she could not keep off the cold; and she dared not go home, for she had sold no matches, and could not take home even a penny of money. Her father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at home as here. How did the little girl feel in the passage?",

      "question": "Let's face it -- you're going to get a lot of well-intentioned advice from friends, parents and grandparents about your sleep. Some of this advice is going to be just wrong. Myth 1: Sleeping late on the weekends will make up for lost sleep during the week. Fact: Getting less than the amount of sleep that you need night after night accumulates over time and starts to create a \"sleep debt\". And like all debts, eventually you need to pay the price. The problem with waiting until the weekend to meet sleep needs is that in the meantime, you are paying the price of being less alert, feeling more moody, thinking slower and having less stimulation. Myth 2: A boring teacher (or warm room, full stomach, etc.) can put teens to sleep. Fact: If you are getting enough sleep on a regular basis, there is no teacher, math book or reading assignment in the world boring enough to make you fall asleep in class. There are basically two things that make people sleepy -- not getting enough sleep and not getting good quality sleep. The environment kids are in, including the room temperature, light level and entertainment value, may unmask underlying sleepiness, but the environment does not cause it! So if you are dozing off in class, don't blame it on bad teaching.  Myth 3: Teenagers can pull an all-nighter to study and still be ready for the big test in the morning. Fact: Teenagers are much better off studying less and getting a good night's sleep. Research clearly shows that the ability to concentrate and learn new information, as well as to work efficiently, declines sharply after being awake for 15-16 hours, and continues to bottom out the longer you stay up. Plus, if the big test is at 8:00 am, the problem gets even worse. That's because morning time typically represents a low energy point in the body's normal 24-hour circadian  rhythm, especially in teenagers.

      "question": "Once Dr. Mellinkoff invited me to join him at the hospital to discuss interesting cases with his students . The case at hand was a Guatemalan man , aged 34 , who had a fever and many other medical problems . His condition was not improving , and there was not much hope he would live . Dr. Mellinkoff asked to see the patient . He introduced himself in Spanish and , in a very gentle voice , asked how he felt . The patient smiled and said everything was all right . Then the doctor asked if he was able to eat . The patient said that he had no desire to eat . \" Are you getting food you like ? \" The patient said nothing . \" Do you get the kind of food you have at home ? \" The answer was no . The doctor put his hand on the man's shoulder and his voice was very soft . \" If , you had food that you liked , would you eat it ? \" \" Yes , yes . \" the patient said .

      "question": "Cars are lots of fun, but they could also be dangerous. We have to be careful when we drive them or ride in them. It's always a good idea to put on your seat belt when you're in a car. Why? Think about this example: You put an egg on a skateboard and give it a push. If the skateboard hits a stone, it will stop, but the egg won't. It will fly through the air, hit the ground and break. Now, think what would happen if you tied the egg to the skateboard. When the skateboard hits a stone, the egg won't go flying; it will stay safely on the skateboard. Volvo, a famous Swedish carmaker, was the first to use seat belts in 1849. Air bags are also very important for car safety, because sometimes a seat belt isn't enough. If the car is going really fast and runs into something, seat belts could even hurt the people who wear them. Most new cars have air bags in front of and next to the seats.

I thought I might as well take the chance to see as much of the country as I could, but it was difficult to travel around Nepal. The hospital let me have a few days' holiday, so I decided to go into the forest and I asked a Nepalese guide, Damal Rai, to go with me.  We started preparing for the trip at six in the morning, and let two elephants carry our equipment. It was hot, but Kamal made me wear shoes and trousers to protect me from snakes. In the forest there was a lot of wildlife, but we were trying to find big cats, especially tigers. We climbed onto the elephants' backs to get a better view, but it is unusual to find tigers in the afternoon because they sleep in the heat of the day. Then in the distance, we saw a tiger, and Kamal told me to be very quiet. We crept near and found a dead deer, still bleeding. This was the tiger's lunch! Suddenly I started to feel very frightened. We heard the tiger a second before we saw it. It jumped out like a flash of lightning, five hundred kilos plus and four metres long. I looked into its eyes and face, and saw right down the animal's throat. It grabbed Kamal's leg between its teeth, but I managed to pull Kamal away. One of our elephants ran at the tiger and made it go back into the grass. So we quickly escaped to let the tiger eat its lunch. That night it was impossible to sleep.

Science fiction writers have written about flying cars for a long time. But now flying cars will soon fly out of the world of science fiction into our real world. And the dream of the science fiction writers will soon come true. The first-known sky car is the FSC-1. The FSC-1 looks like an expensive sports car. You can drive the FSC-1 on the road like a normal car. If you touch a button, its wings and propeller   fold out and then it can take off, fly and land as an airplane. The owners of the FSC-1 can choose if they want to drive or fly. Another flying car or sky car is the Moller Skycar M400. Although you can't drive it on the roads, it is small and easy to fly and can take off and land like a helicopter  . Urban Aeronautics' X-Hawk is another type of sky car. It is expected to be available for about $3 million. Just like any new technology, flying cars have taken a long time to be developed.

      "question": "(CNN)-China will sometimes say \"no\" and the world should get used to it. That message came through when China joined Russia in blocking action on Syria. \"Do not mistakenly think that because China takes a careful and responsible position on the Syria issue, China will not use its veto power   or will always abstain ,\" said Cui Tiankai, China's vice foreign minister, \"When China must use its veto power to say no, it will surely use it.\" On Saturday, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the vetoes \"disgusting and shameful.\" He Wenping, director of African Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the veto shows China's confidence in foreign affairs. \"A country expressing its true opinion - that's progress. China opposes the use of threat or force to achieve regime change in other countries. This agrees with China's long-standing diplomacy principle. It is also not acceptable for China to rush a U.N. vote without sufficient discussion.\" So why did China use its veto this time? China's critics say China's veto of the U.N. draft proposal  was in part due to Beijing's fear that allowing a regime change in Syria could encourage the spread of the Arab revolution and eventually threaten China. He Wenping disagrees, \"China has a completely different political system and economic development path. If someone in the international community thinks that the Arab Spring will happen in China, then I think they misjudge the situation in China, exaggerate  some problems in the Chinese society and underestimate the ability of the Chinese government to control the situation in China.\" What can we learn from the passage?",

The number of disabled people in India alone is probably more than double the total population of Canada.      In the United Kingdom, about one in ten people have some disability. Disability is not just something that happens to other people: as we get older, many of us will become less mobile, hard of hearing or have failing eyesight.      Disablement can take many forms and occur at any time of life. Some people are born with disabilities. Many others become disabled as they get older. There are many progressive disabling diseases. The longer time goes on, the worse they become. Some people are disabled in accidents. Many others may have a period of disability in the form of a mental illness. All are affected by people's attitude towards them.      Disabled people face many physical barriers. Next time you go shopping or to work or visit friends, imagine how you would manage if you could not get up steps, or on to buses and trains. How would you cope if you could not see where you were going or could not hear the traffic? But there are other barriers: prejudice can be even harder to break down and ignorance inevitably represents by far the greatest barrier of all. It is almost impossible for the able-bodied to fully appreciate what the severely disabled go through, so it is important to draw attention to these barriers and show that it is the individual person and their ability, not their disability, which counts.

      "question": "Beauty has always been regarded as something praiseworthy. Almost everyone thinks attractive people are happier and healthier,have better marriages and have more respectable occupations. Personal consultants give them better advice for finding jobs. Even judges are softer on attractive defendants .But in the executive circle,beauty can become a _ . While attractiveness is a positive factor for a man on his way up the executive ladder,it is harmful to a woman. Handsome male executives were thought as having more integrity than plainer men;effort and ability were thought to account for their success. Attractive female executives were considered to have less integrity than unattractive ones;their success was attributed not to ability but to factors such as luck. All unattractive women executives were thought to have more integrity and to be more capable than the attractive female executives. Interestingly,though,the rise of the unattractive overnight successes was attributed more to personal relationships and less to ability than that of attractive overnight successes. Why are attractive women not thought to be able?An attractive woman is thought to be more feminine and an attractive man more masculine than the less attractive ones. Thus,an attractive woman has an advantage in traditionally female jobs,but an attractive woman in a traditionally masculine position appears to lack the \"masculine\" qualities required. This is true even in politics. \"When the only clue is how he or she looks,people treat men and women differently,\"says Anne Bowman,who recently published a study on the effects of attractiveness on political candidates. She asked 125 undergraduate students to rank two groups of photographs,one of men and one of women,in order of attractiveness. The students were told the photographs were of candidates for political offices. They were asked to rank them again,in the order they would vote for them. The results showed that attractive males utterly defeated unattractive men,but the women who had been ranked most attractive invariably received the fewest votes.

      "question": "Singles Day falls on every November 11th, and as the name indicates, this relatively new holiday is one exclusively for people who are still living the single life. I was a bit surprised when I googled \"Singles Day\" on the Internet, to find that China is the only country in the world that has set aside a special day for singles to celebrate their lives. To find out more about this celebration, please read on. An old story goes that once there were four single men, leading very boring lives. None of them were married, or had lovers, or did anything exciting. They just sat around all day and played Mahjong. One day they played Mahjong from 11 in the morning until 11 at night. During the game, no matter who won, the winning card was always the \"four columns\" card (the card shows four independent, parallel columns in two lines). Even more of a coincidence, it was Nov 11, or 11/11. In order to commemorate the day, they nicknamed it Singles Day. Singles Day was first celebrated at various universities in Nanjing, capital city of Jiangsu Province during the 1990s. It got the name Singles Day because the date consists of four \"ones\". These college students have since graduated, and carried their university tradition into society. Singles Day is now a special day for all fashionable youths. The main way to celebrate Singles Day is to have dinner with your single friends, but it's important that each person pay their own fee to show their independence. People also hold \"blind date\" parties in an attempt to say goodbye to their single lives. Many singles also choose to say goodbye to their single lives on this day. Many attend \"blind date\" parties and many people choose to marry on this day. In addition to meaning \"single\" the four \"ones\" of the date can also mean \"only one\" as in \"the only one for me.\" Some people will use this date and this meaning to tell their special someone that they are the only \"one\" in their heart.

      "question": "The Internet has revolutionized our lives to such an extent that for most people, the global network has become more than just a tool but rather an indispensable aid in everyday life. More and more people go online as wireless networks have brought the Internet closer and closer: it's on our mobile phones, in our cars and TV sets, in hospital surgery rooms and in fishing boats that battle the waves of the Atlantic. And this revolution has brought along with it a new way of shopping. Both big and small, e-commerce websites have literally flooded the Internet by the hundreds of thousands. Anything you can buy from a brick and mortar store  you can also buy online: from food and clothes to guns and bombs, no matter what you're looking for, you're bound to find the right online store with just a few clicks of the mouse. This revolution has sent cold trembles down the backbones of brick and mortar business owners. And what was their reaction? They've opened online stores to go hand in hand with their conventional businesses. Nowadays, every \"Mom and Pop's\" cheesecake store also has a website. In a recent survey, 68% of small business owners have stated that they are scared of being put out of business by the powerful flood that e-commerce has become. So it's no wonder many of them have decided to join the revolution and establish some kind of an online presence even though most of them have stated that they dislike the Internet. But do the big players have reasons to be afraid? Are we going to start seeing ghostly, deserted Wal-Marts across the country? Probably not in the near future but the day will come when most people will just stop shopping offline anymore. A trip to Wal-Marts wastes time, burns gas and sometimes adds a few extra dots on the stress counter. The recent advancements in mobile technology and the introduction of mobile phones with improved web capabilities has even made some people order their groceries when they get out from work and have them delivered at their doorstep by the time they get home. And as \"Time is money\", this practice is lifesaving for people who work two jobs. Technology will continue to advance and e-commerce will follow closely in its footsteps. Everything will become easier and less time consuming, leaving us more time to enjoy the things that really matter in life: the ones we love, our friends and hobbies.

      "question": "Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire   to find a way out of trouble. What did the company where Dick Drew work learn from its mistake?",

      "question": "Anna was excited about starting her first day in the new school. However, when she first walked past the students in the school, her excitement turned to fear, and then to loneliness over the next few days. \"Why didn't anyone say 'hi' to me or invite me to his or her lunch table? Is it because of my clothes or my hair?\" she wondered. Almost every day during the first week, Anna stayed alone, thinking that there must have been something wrong with her or that nobody saw her at all! What caused Anna's problem? The reason was that nobody knew her. Most people don't like talking with strangers  . So it's your job to volunteer to make contact with people who you want to know. The easiest way to catch their attention is to notice them first. Make eye contact with them and smile at them. When you smile at them, you are doing your best to show your kindness to them, and they are sure to understand that you are saying, \"Hey, how's everything going?\" In this way, you are taking the first step towards the road to friendship. When Anna realized this, she started talking to her classmates. Guess what happened? It really worked. She had made two friends by the end of the month. In fact, saying \"hi\" or making friends with strangers is not hard. And the joy it brings you is really great. So try to open your heart to strangers! What was Anna's problem?",

      "question": "German academics believe they have solved the centuries-old mystery of the \"Mona Lisa\" in Leonardo ad Vinci's famous portrait  . Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant, Francesco del Giocondo, has long been seen as the most likely model for the sixteenth-century painting. Art historians have wondered whether the smiling woman may actually have been da Vinci's lover or mother, or the artist himself. Now experts at the prefix = st1 /HeidelbergUniversitylibrary say old notes made in a book by its owner in October, 1503, confirm that Lisa del Giocondo was indeed the model for the famous portrait in the world. \"All doubts about the identity of the Mona Lisa have been removed by a discovery by Dr. Armin Schlechter,\" the library said in a statement on Monday. \"Until then, only 'scant   evidence' from sixteenth-century documents had been available. These had left lots of room for doubt, and many different identities were put forward.\" The comments compare Leonardo to the ancient Greek artist Apelles, and say he was working on three paintings at that time, one of which was a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. Art experts say the Heidelbergdiscovery is a break-through, and the earliest mention linking the merchant's wife to the portrait. Before this discovery the earliest link dated from around 1550, and was made by Italian official Giorgio Vasari, the library said, adding that there had been doubts about Vasari's reliability. The Heidelbergnotes were actually discovered over two year's ago in the library by Schlechter, a spokeswoman said.

While unwilling at first to swim in cold water or get her face wet, she began to train in earnest   as her talent became clear.

I had got into the habit of sitting in the last carriage at the platform, so I could get off near to the station exit at my end. One evening before getting off the train, I found a purse. I opened the purse and thought this must be my lucky day, for the purse contained some PS80 in cash. Looking further into the purse, I found credit cards, and house keys and a name and address. My first thought when seeing the cash was to pocket it, and throw the other contents away. Now I am not a basically dishonest person, but had developed a hardened attitude over the years that most people were dishonest in some way, and my own personal experience had been that whenever I lost anything of value, that was the last I ever saw of it. And since I was a construction worker at that time, I had been the victim of a great deal of stealing during my working life. Almost as I read the name and address, I had a picture of that woman being struck with terror, when she realized she had lost her purse, and could not get into her home, had no money, and, would have thoughts of someone spending on her credit cards, not to mention the trouble of canceling all the cards. In that same moment I decided to hand the purse over  to the train guard. So I told him I would like to see it returned to its rightful owner. He told me would be sent to the lost property office.

      "question": "In my experience, one of the greatest reasons of unhappiness is the difficulty we have in accepting things as they are.When we see something we don't like, we wish it could be different-we cry out for something better.That may be human nature, or perhaps it's something that has been grown in our culture. The root of the unhappiness isn't that we want things to be different, however, it's that we decided we didn't like it in the first place.We've judged it as bad, rather than saying, \"It's not bad or good, but it just is.\" Here is an example.I have written a paper, A Beautiful Method to Find Peace of Mind.Quite a few people think it bad after reading it because I think people should expect things to go differently than you planned, and that you should accept that, instead of encouraging people to change themselves or the environment as much as possible.You could accept it as the way the world works-as the way things actually are.And try to understand why that is, and follow it, as it is. This can be useful to whatever you do: whether it be how other people act at work, how politics works and how depressing the news media can be.Accept these things as they are, and try to understand why they're that way. It'll save you a lot of sadness because you'll no longer say, \"Oh, I wish things didn't go bad!\" If you really understand what I mean, you can try a different way to live in this world:accept, and understand.It might lead to some interesting results.

      "question": "The Cuban iguana is a species of lizard  of the iguana family. It is the largest of the West Indian rock iguanas, one of the most endangered groups of lizards. This species with red eyes and a thick tail is one of the largest lizards in the Caribbean. The Cuban iguana is primarily _ ; 95% of its diet consists of the leaves, flowers and fruits from as many as 30 plant species, including the seaside rock bush and various grasses. However, Cuban iguanas occasionally consume animal matter, and individuals have been observed eating the dead flesh of birds, fish and crabs, The researchers wrote that quite a few people on Isla Magueyes could have caused this incident. The Cuban iguana is distributed throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islands with a wild population booming on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. It is also found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, where a separate subspecies occurs. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites half destroyed by Cuban crocodiles. To avoid the attack from them, the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti  . In general the species is in decline, more quickly on the mainland than on the outlying islands. One of the reasons for their decline is habitat destruction caused by the over consuming of farm animals, housing development, and the building of tourist resorts on the beaches where the animals prefer to build their nests. Although the wild population is in decline, the numbers of iguanas have been sharply increased as a result of captive-breeding  and other conservation programs. .What's the author's purpose of writing the text?",

      "question": "Staying married has its benefits. A new U.S.-wide study shows the wealth of a married person is almost double that of somebody who is single. \"If you really want to increase your wealth, get married and stay married. On the other hand, divorce can destroy your wealth,\" said Jay Zagorsky, author of the study. Married people will see an increase in wealth that is more than just adding the assets of two single people, ac-cording to the study published in the Journal of Sociology. Those who remained together saw a 93 percent gain in wealth compared to that of a single person, while individuals facing divorce saw their financial situation worsen long before they finally divorced, according to Zagorsky. The study used data from surveys taken over a 15-year period involving 9,055 Americans who were between 21 and 28 years old in 1985. Those who remained single had a steady, but slow growth in wealth, from less than $2,000 at the start of the surveys up to an average of about $11,000 after 15 years. However, those who married and stayed that way showed a sharp increase in wealth after marriage, growing to an average $43,000 by the 10th year of marriage or by about 16 percent a year. For people who married and then divorced, there was a slow build-up of wealth during the early years of marriage and then a steady decrease about four years before divorce. The study also showed doubt about a common idea that divorce was much harder financially on women than on men. In fact, it showed that women suffered financially only slightly more than men.

      "question": "A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics   have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress.

      "question": "Given the tradition of students bringing apples to their teachers, it somehow seems fitting that an old apple barn  will find a new life as a one-room schoolhouse. And it is just as fitting that a retired schoolteacher will become the caretaker of that historic treasure. My friend Velma, a teacher for more than 30 years, has been retired for some time now, but that doesn't stop her giving history lessons at the old Englewood School, located on her family's California farm. The lovingly restored building was constructed around 1850 as a home for a woodsman and later was used as apple barn. Then, in 1870 it began a new life as a schoolhouse. Originally located in the nearby Englewood meadow, it was now moved its current site in 1978 by Velma's late husband and his brother, Robert and Richard, who thought it would help keep Velma busy in retirement. No nails had been used in the original construction, so each piece of wood had to be carefully marked and the building was reassembled on its new site. The brothers worked with much care and hard work to ensure a perfect fit of mitered corners. After the relocation, Velma and her family furnished the school with some of its original desks. They also added a collection of schoolbooks, the oldest dating back to 1845. Perhaps the school's most cherished souvenir is the diploma of student Hettie Essig, who graduated on June 30, 1904. Hettie's daughter, Flora, presented Velma with _ . Nowadays Velma gives tours to local schoolchildren and other groups, who learn what it was like to attend school back in the good old days. She has kids ring the school bell, recite the Pledge of Allegiance and sing \"Good Morning to You\" as they might have done in days gone by.

      "question": "According to a recent survey, Canadian parents realize their role as protectors and providers to raise their children both emotionally and physically. That's not very different from the way our parents saw themselves. But with more two-career families and busy schedules, one thing parents today recognize more than ever is the need to set aside special time for their children. These 'nurturing moments' are changed into memories that they will treasure all their lives. Nurturing moments might be the time between our work and life,bringing your child to work with you to see what you do during the day,visiting your child's make-believe world,discussing his other school day and exploring the natural world outside your door. These times are not merely a luxury  , they're a necessity. It's during these moments that parents pass values and attitudes to their children. Over time, children pick up good habits and positive self-image. Here are a few tips for making the most of your family time together: Regularly sit down as a family to share a meal. Allow each person to describe something interesting about his or her day. Make one night a week family night. Family members take turns choosing a special activity for the evening everyone partakes in the fun. Show your children you care about their interests by having them teach you about their activity or hobby. Nurturing healthy children involves body, mind and spirit. The little things you do to your care are the building blocks for confidence, self-esteem and a healthy outlook. By giving your children these tools, you prepare them for life.

Although they lived mostly with their mother, they spent a lot of time with us. Over the years, we all learned to become more comfortable with each other. However, I continued to feel somewhat like an outsider.  When the children moved to a town five hours away, my husband was understandably destroyed. In order to keep in touch with the kids, we set up an e-mail and chat-line service. Ironically  , this technology can make us feel out of touch and more in need of real human contact. If a computer message came addressed to \"Dad\", I'd feel forgotten. If my name appeared along with his, it would brighten my day.  _ not just over the telephone wires. Late one evening, as my husband was snoozing  , I was catching up on my e-mail, an \"instant message\" appeared on the screen. It was Margo, my oldest stepdaughter, also up late in front of her computer. We sent several messages back and forth, exchanging the latest news. When we \"chatted\" like that, she wouldn't necessarily know if it was me or her dad unless she asked. That night she didn't ask and I didn't tell her it was me either. After hearing the latest volleyball scores and the details about a coming dance at her school, I said that it was late and I should go to sleep. Her return message read, \"Okay, talk to you later!

Tell your teacher or parents about any problem that is preventing you from paying attention. Take good notes Write down facts that your teacher mentions or writes on the board. Try to use good handwriting so you can read your notes later. It's a good idea to keep your notes organized by subject. Plan ahead for tests and projects Waiting until Thursday night to study for Friday's test will make it hard to do your best. One of the best ways to make sure that doesn't happen is to plan ahead. Write down your test dates. You can then plan how much to do after school each day, and how much time to spend on each topic. Break it up When there's a lot to study, it can help to break things into several parts. Let's say you have a spelling test on 20 words. Instead of thinking about all of the words at once, try breaking them down into five-word groups and work on one or two different groups each night. Ask for help You can't study effectively if you don't understand the material. Be sure to ask your teacher for help. If you're at home when the confusion occurs, your morn or dad might be able to help. Sleep tight So the test is tomorrow and you've followed your study plan--but suddenly you can't remember anything!

It produces a poison that causes a painless , watery diarrhea( )  that can quickly lead to severe dehydration  and death if treatment is not given. Most persons infected with cholera do not become ill, although the bacterium is present in their waste for 7-14 days. When this illness does strike, more than 90% of the time is not severe and is difficult to tell from other types of diarrhea. Less than 10% of sick persons develop cholera with signs of moderate or severe dehydration. A person may get cholera by drinking water or eating food polluted with the cholera bacterium. The disease can spread rapidly in areas without the proper treatment of drinking water. The cholera bacterium may also live in the environment in dirty rivers and coastal waters. Shellfish eaten raw have been a source of cholera. Therefore, the disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another. Cholera can be simply and successfully treated by immediate replacement of the fluid and salts lost through diarrhea.

We can get you a sunrise over the sea, if necessary, but not a sunset.\" \"But I want a sunset!\" the director shouted. \"Go to the airport, take the next flight to the west coast, and get one.\" But then a young secretary had an idea. \"Why don't you photograph a sunrise,\" she suggested, \"and then play it backwards? Then it'll look like a sunset.\" \"That's a very good idea!\" the director said. Then he turned to the camera crew and said, \"Tomorrow morning I want you to get me a beautiful sunrise over the sea.\" The camera crew went out early the next morning and filmed a bright sunrise over the beach in the middle of a beautiful bay. Then at nine o'clock they took it to the director. \"Here it is, sir,\" they said, and gave it to him. He was very pleased. They all went into the studio. \"All right,\" the director explained, \"now our hero and heroine are going to say goodbye. Run the film backwards so that we can see the 'sunset' behind them.\" The \"sunset\" began, but after a quarter of a minute, the director suddenly put his face in his hands and shouted to the camera crew to stop. The birds in the film were flying backwards, and the waves on the sea were going away from the beach. One evening, the director sent his camera crew out   _  .",

      "question": "As we know, there are differences between western culture and Chinese culture. We can see differences when we pay attention to the way words are used. Let's look at the words about animals and plants. Most expressions in Chinese about the dog, for example, \"a homeless dog\", \"a mad dog\", \"a running dog\" and \"a dog catching a mouse\", have negative meanings. But in western countries, dogs are thought to be honest and good friends of humans. In English, people use the dog to describe positive actions. For example, \"you are a lucky dog\" means you are a lucky person. And \"every dog has its day\" means each person has good luck sometimes. To describe a person's serious illness, they say \"sick as a dog\". The word \"dog-tired\" means very tired. However, Chinese love cats very much. But in western culture, \"cat\" is often used to describe a woman who is cruel. There are many other examples of how \"cat\" is used differently as well. The rose is regarded as a symbol of love in both China and some western countries. People think the rose stands for love, peace, courage and friendship. And the rose is the national flower of England, America and many other countries. The words about plants and animals are used in positive or negative ways in different cultures. We can learn about many differences in cultures by comparing how some words are used. Which of the following is true according to the passage?",

It will be better.' \" It is better-- much better. Winfrey is a billionaire, and \"the Oprah Winfrey Show\", which is watched by over 20 million people every day, has won many awards.    As a little girl, Winfrey was always different. She learned to read when she was three. She read the Bible in church and was famous for being the little girl who talked a lot. Since then, talking has been the most important part of her life.    She got her first big chance while at Tennessee State University. At age 17, she was offered a job at a radio station. Next, she hosted a talk show, \" People Are Talking\" , which soon became very popular. People felt comfortable telling her about their lives, and people liked her warm interviewing style. After a year, the show was renamed \" The Oprah Winfrey Show\" , and she was a star.    Winfrey's real dream, though , was to be an actor.

      "question": "Shake Shack is a new kind of restaurant becoming more popular in the U.S. The restaurants are not\"fast food\" . They are known as\"fast casual\" . Observers say Americans want more choices and fresh food when choosing where and what to eat. This trend is one reason why the fast food restaurant McDonald' s has struggled financially. In the last quarter of 2014, McDonald' s net income dropped by about $300 million. The January earnings report brought more bad news. Worldwide sales dropped for the eighth month in a row and even more than expected. While McDonald' s is struggling to get their customers back, Shake Shack, is doing well in making money. The New York-based burger chain had a very successful IPO, or initial public offering, of shares at the end of January. On its first day of trading, Shake Shack went from $21 a share to just under $46 a share. Being part of the \"fast casual \"trend has helped Shake Shack. Other fast casual restaurants in the U.S. include Chipotle and Panera. Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant expert with NPD has studied Americans' restaurant habits for almost 30 years. She says one reason why Americans like fast casual food is that it' s new. It' s creative, it' s something different and people like to try new things. Her study shows Americans made 61 billion visits to restaurants last year. Three out of four visits were to fast food restaurants, like McDonald' s. Fast casual is still a small percentage of restaurant visits, but it has developed fast. Just as Ms. Riggs says,\"It' s growing _ because they meet consumers' needs. They know it' s being prepared while they wait, it' s fresh, quality food, good tasting food at what they say are reasonable and affordable prices.\" Many Americans still like their fast food.

      "question": "The first English dictionary was published in 1604. The dictionary was actually nothing more than a list of about 3, 000 difficult words, each followed by a one-word definition. The author, Robert Cawdrey, made no attempt to include everyday words in his dictionary. No one, he reasoned, would ever have to look up a word in a dictionary if he already knew the meaning of the word. During the 1600's more dictionaries were published. Each followed Cawdrey's lead and presented a few thousand hard words. Around 1700 one dictionary maker, John Kersey, did define easy words as well as hard words. But until the 1750's all the dictionaries were rather crude and not very valuable. A man named Dr Samuel Johnson changed all this. In 1755 Dr Johnson produced the first modern dictionary. He included in his dictionary all important words, both easy and hard, and he gave good meanings. He also gave good sentences to show how each word was actually used in speech and in writing. By the end of the 1700's most dictionary makers had followed Johnson's example. Dictionaries were getting better and better. The 1800's saw the greatest improvement in the quality of dictionaries. In England scholars planned and prepared the Oxford English Dictionary, a twenty-volume (;;) work. One of the most interesting features of the Oxford Dictionary is its word histories.

      "question": "Many kids turn up their noses at the thought of eating fish because, well, it can smell \"fishy\".  While it is usually a healthy source of protein in the diet, there may be several reasons to avoid biting into a forkful of fish. Before you break out the tartar sauce, learn some facts about fish to keep yourself and the environment healthy. Some fish may contain harmful chemicals, which can be the result of both natural causes and water pollution. Mercury is a poisonous chemical, which occurs naturally in oceans and the Earth's crust, but also comes from man-made sources, such as pesticides, burning garbage, and the releasing of fossil fuels. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of chemicals, can also be found in some fish. These dangerous man-made chemicals were used in many industries until 1977, when they were banned.  PCBs were released or leaked into the air and water and have been transported around the globe. How do mercury and PCBs end up in fish and the food supply? When they are released into the air, they attach themselves to particles. These particles settle on the ground and in the water and are eventually eaten by microscopic organisms. Small fish eat the micro-organisms, and large fish eat the small fish and on up the food chain. Because they can negatively affect your health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency advises that kids younger than 15 years old avoid fish that contain high levels of mercury and PCBs. These include shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. There are also many types of fish that are good for you, but because of overfishing are in danger of being wiped out. Some are being fished in the wild so much that they cannot reproduce fast enough to survive. Others are being farmed in ways that are not environmentally friendly. These fish include red snapper, Atlantic salmon, blue-fin tuna, and king crab. Despite these problems, there are several fish that are both healthy and sustainable, such as Alaskan salmon, American catfish, Pacific cod, and several farm-raised fish and shellfish.

      "question": "Because plants cannot move or talk, most people believe that they have no feelings and that they cannot receive signals from outside. However, this may not be completely true. People who studied plants have found out that plants carry a small electrical charge  . It is possible to measure this charge with a small piece of equipment called \"galvanometer\". The galvanometer is placed on a leaf off the plant, and it records any changes in the electrical field of the leaf. Humans have a similar field which can change when we are shocked or frightened. A man called Backster used a galvanometer for his studies of plants and was very surprised at his results. He found that if he had two or more plants in a room and he began to destroy one of them - perhaps by pulling off its leaves or by pulling it out of its pot - then the galvanometer on the leaves of the other plants showed a change in the electrical field. It seemed as if the plants were signalling a feeling of shock. This happened not only when Backster started to destroy plants, but also when he destroyed other living things such as insects  . Backster said that the plants also knew if someone had destroyed a living thing some distance away, because they signalled when a man who had just cut down a tree entered the room. Another scientist, named Sauvin, achieved similar results to Backster's. He kept galvanometers fixed to his plants all the time and checked regularly to see what the plants were doing. If he was out of the office, he telephoned to find out about the signals the plants were sending. In this way, he found that the plants were sending out signals at the exact times when he felt strong pleasure or pain. In fact, Sauvin could cause a change in the electrical field of his plants over a distance of a few miles simply by thinking about them.

On April 15th 2009, when Susan got up to sing, the audience was shocked by her age and simplicity. Middle-aged women were not the usual type of competitor on the show and the audience was even more surprised when she said before starting to sing that she wanted to become a professional singer. To them she looked well past such possibilities. However, she amazed everybody with her wonderful voice and became an overnight singing star. It was reported that the audience all stood up and clapped warmly and that within 9 days, 100 million people had watched her performances and interviews on the Internet.

It listed all the tradesmen in each village in my part of the country and it was impressive to see the great variety of services which were available on one's own doorstep in the late Victorian countryside.        Nowadays a superficial traveler in ruralprefix = st1 /Englandmight conclude that the village tradesmen still flourishing were either selling frozen food to the residents or selling old things to visitors. Nevertheless. This would really be a false impression. There has been smaller village commerce ,but its vigor is still remarkable.        Our local grocer's shop, for example, is actually expanding in spite of the competition from supermarkets in the nearest town. Women prefer to go there and exchange the local news while purchasing, instead of purchasing up at a supermarket. And the shop owner knows well that personal service has a substantial cash value.        His prices may be a bit higher than those in the town, but he will deliver anything at any time. His assistants think nothing of bicycling down the village street in their lunch hour to take a piece of cheese to an aged woman who sent her order by word of mouth with a friend who happened to be passing. The wealthier customers telephone their shopping lists and the goods are on their doorsteps within an hour. I also find it satisfactory because a village shop offers one of the few ways in which a modest individualist can still get along in the world without attaching himself to the big groups of industry or commerce.        Most of the village shopkeepers I know, are individualists in their ways. For example, our shoemaker stares with a cold look at the pairs of cheap, mass-produced shoes taken to him for repair.

      "question": "The coyote  , that clever animal of wide-open spaces, has come to the nation's capital. In fact, coyotes have spread to every corner of the United States, changing their behaviors to fit new environments and causing researchers to deal with a troublesome new kind of creature: the city coyote. The coyote originally lived in the middle of the continent. One of its most obvious characters is its smartness, which has made the animal a notorious   pest. Hunters trapped, shot and poisoned more than a million coyotes in the 1900s. It's still one of America's most hunted animals. Yet the coyote has survived. How has the coyote shown this extraordinary ability? \"I guess if you wanted to use one word, it'd be ' _ ',\" says Eric Gese, an expert at Utah State University. Coyotes can live alone, in pairs, or in large packs like wolves; hunt at night or during the day; occupy a small region or an area up to 40 square miles; and live on all sorts of food, from lizards and shoes, to ants and melons. Unbelievably people helped coyotes increase when they killed most of the wolves in the United States. The spreading of coyotes into city areas, though, is recent. They travel at night, crossing sidewalks and bridges, running along roads and ducking into culverts   and underpasses. No one knows why coyotes are moving into cities, but experts explain that cleverer, more human-tolerant   coyotes are teaching urban survival skills to new generations. Occasionally, coyotes might attack human beings. There have been about 160 attacks on people in recent years. Therefore, people have been consistently told not to feed coyotes or leave pet food unsecured. That, plus a large trapping program in the neighborhood, has cut down on the coyote population.

      "question": "A new study says electronic toys are not helping babies learn. \"Even if companies are marketing them as educational, they're not teaching the babies anything at this time,\" said Anna Sosa the study's author. Researchers listened to audio recordings of parents playing with their babies aged 10 months to 16 months. The researchers compared the experiences when the children played with electronic toys, traditional toys such as blocks, or when the children looked at books. What they found is that parents talked less with their babies when the babies played with electronic toys. Why is this important? Research shows that how quickly children develop language is often based on what they hear from parents. When the infants played with electronic toys, parents said little to their children. But with traditional toys, such as blocks, parents shared the names and descriptions of the animals, colors and shapes as their children played. There was even more information given by parents as their babies looked at the pictures in books. Of course, there is no need for parents to throw out electronic toys, but they should look at their infants' play with such toys as entertainment, not a learning experience. Toy Industry Association spokeswoman Adrienne Appell responded to the study. She said it is important that parents make time to play with their children. \"Playing is a way that kids can learn so much, not only cognitive  skills, but social and developmental skills,\" she said. She added that play should be balanced, including time for just \"make believe\" activities, as well as traditional and electronic toys.

      "question": "Most people want to be successful, but never stop to think what it will really take to get there in their chosen field. If it means going back to college for 2 years of night school, could you do it ? If it means reading a book a week for about 6 months in order to really master a new skill ? If you aren't prepared to do any of those things because they are outside of your comfort zone, then you can forget being succesful. I guarantee you will never reach your goals in life, unless your goals are to be ordinary. The biggest killer by far is the dreaded \" comfort zone \" where most people live in their entire life. And the funny thing is that people just can't wrap their heads around the fact that people who have reached some success get tons of time to just relax, but only because they've earned it ! If you haven't built a successful business, or in some way built a career that allow you so much freee time, then you are stuck in the grinding world of nine-to-five jobs everyone else. So how comfortable is that ? So what can you do about it ? Well, find a way to make something happen in your life--- build a business around your favourite hobby, write a book and publish it, or take a course in stock trading and become an expert at that, working on making enough money to retire. If you don't take massive action that puts your way of your comfort zone, you will never be successful at much of anything. I promise--- and I don't make many promises !

As a pigeon flew over enemy  land, the camera took photos of the land below. This would allow our soldiers to see where the enemies were and what they were doing.

      "question": "Many people often lose their friends and they don't know how to keep a long friendship. So how can you keep a long friendship? The following passage explains very well about this matter.     The first thing you need to do is to become a good listener. In this way, you show your friends that you are interested in their lives. You want to know more about them and you want to help them solve their problems. They will cherish the friendship more if they know you care about them.     The next thing is that you should respect other people's privacy. People usually don't like others to know about their private life, so you should show respect toward their privacy. Sometimes, they need some suggestions from others, but this does not mean that others can know about their entire life. So respect for privacy is a must for keeping a long friendship.  The third important thing is that you need to be able to forgive. You must remember that nobody is perfect in this world. It is important to forgive others not to blame them for the mistakes they have already made. You are not perfect either. Thus you need to apologize to others for the mistakes you may have made.  Pay attention to the three things above, and you will be able to have long friendship. What does the writer suggest you do if your friend makes a mistake?",

      "question": "Less TV Reduce Kids Weight PALO AITO, California--\"Switching off the television may help prevent children from getting fatter--even if they do not change their diet or increase the amount they exercise,\" US researchers said last week. A study of 192 third and fourth grades, generally aged eight and nine, found that children who cut the number of hours spent watching television gained nearly two pounds (0.91 kg) less over a one-year period than those who did not change their television diet. \"The findings are important because they show that weight loss can only be the result of a reduction in television viewing and not any other activity,\" said Thomas Robinson, a pediatrician  at Stanford University. \" American children spend an average of more than four hours per day watching television and videos or playing games, and rates of childhood being very fat have doubled over the past 20 years,\" Robinson said. In the study, presented this week to the Pediatric Academic Societies' annual meeting in San Francisco, the researchers persuaded about 100 of the students to reduce their television viewing by one-quarter to one-third. Children watching fewer hours of television showed a significantly smaller increase in waist size and had less body fat than other students who continue their normal television viewing, even though neither group ate a special diet nor took part in any extra exercise. \"One explanation for the weight loss could be the children unstuck to the television may simply have been moving around and burning off calories,\" Robinson said. \"Another reason might be due to eating fewer meals in front of the television. Some studies have suggested that eating in front of the TV encourages people to eat more,\" Robinson added. Which of the following is right ?",

Calls to the florist   were always in vain ---- it was a cash purchase. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's identity.  But I never stopped imagining who the anonymous sender might be.  My mother often contributed to these imaginings. She'd ask me if there was someone for whom I had done a special kindness who might be showing appreciation. Perhaps the neighbor I'd help when she was unloading a car full of groceries. Or maybe it was the old man across the street whose mail I retrieved  during the winter so he wouldn't have to venture down his icy steps.  When I was 17, a boy broke my heart. The night he called for me the last time, I cried myself to sleep. When I awoke in the morning, there was a message scribbled  on my mirror in red lipstick: \"Heartily know, when half-gods go, the gods arrive.\" I thought about that quotation from Emerson   for a long time, and I left it where my mother had written it. When I finally went to get the glass cleaner, my mother knew everything was all right again. I don't remember ever slamming  my door in anger at her and shouting, \"You just don't understand!\" because she did understand.     One month before my high-school graduation, my father died suddenly of a heart attack. My feelings ranged from grief to abandonment, fear and over-whelming anger that my dad was missing some of the most important events in my life. I became completely uninterested in my upcoming graduation, the senior-class play and the prom-events  that I had worked on and looked forward to.  But my mother, in the midst of her own grief, would not hear of my missing out any of those things. The day before my father died, she and I had gone shopping for a prom dress and found a spectacular  one. Wearing it made me feel like a princess, but it was the wrong size, and when my father died the next day, I forgot all about the dress. My mother didn't. The day before the prom, I found that dress-in the right size, draped over the living room sofa, presented to me -- beautifully, artistically and lovingly. I didn't care about having a new dress, but my mother did. She wanted her children to feel loved and lovable, creative and imaginative. My mother died when I was 22, only ten days after I was married. That was the year the gardenias stopped coming. According to the passage, who was probably the gardenia sender?",

When you have finished with your mobile phone you will be able to bury   it in the garden and wait for it to flower . A biodegradable   mobile phone was, this month, introduced by scientists. It is hoped that the new type of phone will encourage users to recycle. Scientists have come up with a new material over the last five years. It looks like any other plastic and can be hard or soft, and able to change shape. Overtime it can also break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals. British researchers used the new material to develop a phone cover that includes a sunflower seed .When this new type of cover turns into waste, it forms nitrates  . These feed the seed and help the flower grow. Engineers have designed a small transparent   window to hold the seed. They have made sure it only grows when the phone is thrown away. \"We've only put sunflower seeds into the cover so far. But we are working with scientists to find out which flowers would perform best. Maybe we could put roses in next time.\" said one scientist. As phone technology is developing so quickly, people are constantly throwing their mobiles away. This means producers are under pressure to find ways of recycling them. Some 650 million mobile phones have been sold this year. Most of them will be thrown away within two years, adding plastic, heavy metal and chemical waste to the environment.

      "question": "Have you ever noticed what happens to an idea once you express it? Just talking about it or writing it down causes you to make it clear in your own mind.How can you use this to increase your brain power? Start writing. By putting thoughts into words, you are telling yourself the logic   behind what you think, feel, or only partly understand.Often, explaining a thought is the process of understanding.In other words, you increase your brain power by exercising your \"explain power.\" Try this experiment.Explain how you'll increase your brain power, even if you have no idea how right now.Just start with anything, and create an explanation.For example, start with \"I'll learn chess,\" or \"I'll read an article on the mind every week.\" Explain how that will help.You'll be surprised how often this becomes a workable plan, and if you actually do this, you'll have a better understanding of your brain twenty minutes from now. Another benefit of writing is that it helps you remember.Many, if not most, highly productive people are always taking notes.You can try keeping it all in your head, but if you keep a journal of your ideas the next time you're working on a big project, you'll probably have more success. Want to understand a topic? Write a book about it.That's an extreme example, but if you are learning something new, write a letter to a friend about it, and you will understand it better.Want to invent something? Write an explanation of the problem, why you want to solve it, and why it is worth solving, and you're half-way there. Writers don't always write because they clearly understand something beforehand.Often, they write about something because they want to understand it.You can do the same.Writing will help bring you to an understanding.Give it a try.

      "question": "The blue tits  have been inspecting the nest-box again this year. The male is the house-hunter but the female will make the final choice. He lands at the hole and turns his head to expose his white cheeks as a signal to attract the female from where she has been feeding. Among many birds that nest in holes, the male has a light-coloured patch on its plumage  which acts as signal for drawing the female's attention to a suitable nesting-place. Unlike the blue tit, the redstart  may be only the male that strikingly coloured and the female is not beautiful. A few years ago I was lucky enough to spot a pair of redstarts in action in a Walsh wood. The male was leading an interested female to holes that he had previously  checked out. He sat at the entrance of each hole and put his head on to show off his white forehead, or his head in to reveal  his tail. If the female failed to react to his visual signals, the male sometimes sang for extra effect, while gliding towards her on spread wings and tail. Once the female accepts by following the male through the hole the displays stop, you must be at the right place at the right time to watch them. How do the blue tits choose their nest?",

      "question": "The term culture now is more used to describe everything from the fine arts to the outlook of a business group or a sports team. In its original sense, however, culture includes all identifying aspects of a racial group, nation, or empire: its physical environment, history, and traditions, its social rules and economic structure, and its religious beliefs and arts. The central beliefs and customs of a group are handed down from one generation to another. It is for this reason that most people regard culture as learned rather than innate. People acquire a culture because they are not born with one. The process by which a person develops a taste for regional foods, accented speech, or an outlook on the world over time, therefore, is known as enculturation  . Cultures are often identified by their symbols -- images that are familiar and coated with meaning. Totem poles   carved with animals and creative figures suggest aspects of the Native American peoples of the Pacific Northwest but more literally represent specific tribes. In Asia and India, the color1 of yellow is connected with temples while in ancient China it was a color1 only the emperor's family was allowed to wear. Thus, different cultures may respond to a symbol quite differently. For example, to some a flag may represent pride, historical accomplishments, or ideals; to others, however, it can mean danger or oppression.  To individuals unfamiliar with cultures outside their own, the beliefs, behaviors, and artistic expression of other groups can seem strange and even threatening. A society that ranks all other cultures against its own standards is considered to be ethnocentric (from the Greek ethnos, meaning \"people,\" and kentros, meaning \"center\"). A strongly ethnocentric society assumes also that what is different from its own culture is likely to be inferior and, possibly, wrong or evil.  All people are ethnocentric to some degree, and some aspects of ethnocentrism, such as national pride, contribute to a well-functioning society. An appreciation for one's own culture, however, does not prevent acceptance and respect for another culture. History documents the long-term vigor and success of multicultural groups in which people from numerous and various cultural backgrounds live and work together. Extreme ethnocentrism, in contrast, can lead to racism -- the belief that it is race and racial origin that account for variations in human character or ability and that one's own race is superior to all others.

However, the archaeologists working on the excavation  have found that they still have a great deal to do. The sun, the wind and tourists have left their mark on the village, originally discovered by Bernard Bruyere in 1935.     \"From our modern perspective, it is upsetting to see how the village was first excavated and then left to be destroyed. Passers-by have used the huts as rubbish dumps and restrooms,\" says Jaana Toivari-Viitala, a teacher at the University of Helsinki. \"Fortunately, while we still have some surface cleaning to do, conservation are off to a good start.\"     The hut village offers rare insight into everyday life in ancient Egypt.     \"In the early twentieth century, archaeologists were only interested in the tombs of kings. The workmen's huts they discovered were seen as a necessary evil in the quest for the real treasures.\"     \"Now several international research groups on different excavations are examining everyday life and work in the Valley of the Kings. This seems to be a trend in archaeology right now,\" Toivari-Viitala says.     Her research group wants to find out why the hut village was built on the slope of a mountain, halfway between the construction site and Deir-el-Medina. They are also interested in how many workers lived in the village at a time, when they lived there, and what their role was in the construction work.     \"Comparing the names found in the village and in Deir-el-Medina provides useful information. Judging from the construction methods, settlement in the village can be divided into two separate periods: the initial settlement and a later one.\"     For the time being, much is up to guessing, but Toivari-Viitala believes that the coming four field seasons, three months each, will see results.     \"The working conditions are not nearly as difficult as I thought they would be. The cool winds in the mountains nicely  _ the heat.\" The research group working on the \"Workmen's huts in the Theban mountains\" project is planning to return to the Valley of the Kings in October.

Most of them were established in the 19th century; they were designed to offer women the education they could not receive anywhere else. At that time major universities and colleges accepted only men. In the past 20 years many young women have chosen to study at colleges that accept both men and women. As a result some women's colleges decided to accept men students too. Others, however, refused to change. Now these schools are popular again The president of Trinity College in Washington, D. C. said that by the end of the 1980s women began to recognize that studying at the same school with men did not mean women were having an equal chance to learn. The president of Smith College in Massachusetts says a women's college permits women to choose classes and activities freely. For example, she says that in a women's college a higher percentage of students studies mathematics than in a college with both men and women. Educational experts say men students in the United States usually speak in class more than women students do. In a women's college, women feel free to say what they think. Women's schools also bring out leadership capabilities in many women. Women are represented everywhere. For example, at a women's college every governing office is held by a woman.

Once again, we need people who can write good stories. The judges, who include Mary Littlejohn, the novelist, Michael Brown, the television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing, are looking for interesting and original stories. Detective fiction was extremely popular last year, although the competition winner produced a love story. You can write down about whatever you want but here's some advice to start your thinking: Write about what you know This is the advice which every writer should pay attention to and, last year, nearly everyone who wrote for us did exactly that. Love, family, problems with friends ---- these were the main subjects of the stories. However, you need to turn ordinary situations into something interesting that people will want to read about. Make the reader want to continue reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way. Get your facts right It's no good giving a description of a town or explaining how a jet engine works if you get it wrong. So avoid writing anything unless you're certain about it. Hold the reader's attention Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. There is nothing worse than a poor ending. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual happening at the end. Think about the characters Try to bring the people in your story alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real. Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,5000 words and typed, double-spaced, on one side only of each sheet of paper. Even if you're in danger of missing the closing date, we are unable to accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately your story cannot be returned, nor can we discuss our decisions.

      "question": "Economics   is the study of how societies with limited resources decide what to produce, how to produce and for whom to produce. What, how, and for whom to produce are problems all over the world because human needs are practically unlimited, but all societies have only limited quantities of resources that can be used to produce goods or services. A knowledge of basic economics is important for understanding both the problems and opportunities that will face the world economy in the 21st century. As a student of economics, one will have the chance to discover how commerce , government policies, and day-to-day decisions made by consumers affect his living standards. The study of economics can help him understand the influence of such events as the move to free markets in prefix = st1 /PolandandRussia, or of ups and downs in interest rate and the foreign exchange rate. Economics is influenced by developments in the many different areas of business, politics, science, nature, religion and history. And whether or not one is aware of it, economics is an important part of his life. From a practical point of view, one's study of economics will help improve his decision-making skills. He learns a logical way to compare different courses of action. As he studies the concept   of opportunity cost, for instance, he will discover that every choice he makes has both a benefit and a cost. Suppose someone decides to get a part-time job so he can earn enough money to buy a car. He will have the benefit of owning the car, but he will pay a cost in terms of the leisure hours he gives up for working so as to pay for the car and keep it in good condition.

However, he went to work at an orphanage  in Nepal. His first thought was to make people impressed. \"I thought that if I volunteered just once. I could retell the story over and over,\" Grennan said in a Huffington Post article. However, his three-month stay it the orphanage turned into in unusual experience. It was 2004 and Grennan had given up his job to begin a year-long around-the-world trip, His first three months were spent in Nepal. When he arrived in the village, he knew nothing about the children or the local culture. When he opened the gate of the Little Princes Children's Home, he was faced by the excited children. The young American ended up caring for 18 children. He later discovered that they were trafficked children. So he walked through the mountains with great difficulty to find the kids' families, \"I started walking with photos of the kids.\" he told the Reuters reporter. \"I would show up in villages and show photographs around. I went with 24 photos, and I found 24 families.\" At the same time, he put his heart into Nepalese culture. Grennan said, \"Volunteering is the single best way to see how the rest of the world lives.\" He also encouraged others to do what he had done. He believes that volunteering needs only making decisions to show up. Grennan's fight against child-trafficking has changed him. His book, Little Prince, came out last week.

She was disappointed and felt a bit like a bad mother. She wondered how her own mother had gotten her to eat the food when she was a silly little girl like her daughter, Elise. She grabbed the telephone to ask her mother how she had done it. She had to wait a second before the older woman picked up, but she was greeted with a happy voice. She learned from her mother that she had tricked her into believing her broccoli was a forest of trees. Emilia thought this was a good plan. After she hung up the phone she picked up her son's pacifier off the floor. She then washed it off. She did not want there to be any dirt from the floor on the pacifier.

      "question": "The Ghost Bridegroom At the time of this story, there was a great family gathering at the castle to meet the promised bridegroom of the Baron's daughter. An arrangement had been made between the Baron and an old nobleman of Bavaria, Berton, for a marriage between their children. It would increase the importance of both families. The initial plans had been made in the usual way: the young people were engaged without having met each other and the date set for the wedding. The young Count  Von Altenburg had been recalled from the army and was on his way to the castle to meet his promised bride. Messages had been received from Wurtzburg where he was accidentally delayed. The messages indicated the day and time when he might be expected to arrive. The castle was in a fever of preparation to provide him with a suitable welcome. Anne had dressed with particular care. Bertha and Wilda had selected her clothing and quarreled all morning about what she should wear. The young lady had taken advantage of their arguments to wear exactly what she wanted and had chosen very well. She looked as beautiful as any young bridegroom could wish for, and the excitement made her look even lovelier. The two aunts constantly directed her, as single aunts usually take a great interest in the love affairs of others. They were giving her the final instructions on how to behave, what to say, and how to greet her intended husband. Hour by hour passed. The sun, which had been so warm over the rich forests of the Odenwald, was now setting along the tops of the mountains. The Baron went to the tallest tower in the castle to see if he could see any sign of the Count and his escorts. Once, he thought he saw them. The sound of horns came floating up from the valley. A party of men was seen far below, riding slowly along the road. It was a false alarm, for when they reached the foot of the mountain, they suddenly rode off in a different direction. The sun, by now, had set, and the bats began to fly about in the evening light. It was getting dark, and the only movement on the road was the occasional worker returning home.

      "question": "Bluebirds  looking  secretly  from  nest  boxes.  Tadpoles  swimming  in  a  pond.  Tiger swallowtails flying quickly around a butterfly bush. And over here, a class of students watching it all. A field trip to a nature center? No, it's a schoolyard. With some work on your part, it could even be your schoolyard. Interested in building a schoolyard habitat? Here's how to get started. Gather a Team Students can do a lot on their own, but you'll need adults for a project this big. Get teachers, parents,  and  even  the  headmaster  interested.  Don't  forget  the  maintenance staff--they know more about your school's yard than anyone else and can give you lots of help. Also, ask around your neighborhood for gardeners, naturalists, and others willing to give advice. Map Your Site Which part of the schoolyard can you turn  into a habitat? Is there an unused corner of the playground? Part of a lawn or field you could let go wild? You'll need to make a map of the area showing what's  there now. Then  you  can  figure out  how you want  to  change  it. For  that, you need a plan. Plan a Habitat Here's what you'll need to make your area attractive to wildlife. Food: Plant  flowers, bushes,  and  trees. These  provide  seeds, berries,  leaves,  flowers,  and sweet  liquids.  And  all  of  these  feed  birds,  and  insects.  You  can  also  add  some  feeders  for squirrels and birds. Where possible, stick with native plants--wild plants that grow naturally in your area. They need less care, which means less work for you. Water: A  small pond, birdbath, or  even  a  shallow dish  of  clean water  in  the ground will attract birds. Other small animals like insects may visit as well. Shelter: Bushes and trees make great escapes for birds. Tall grass and \"weeds\" are home to grasshoppers, garter  snakes,  and  some  ground-nesting birds. You  can  also  add  stone  piles  and brush piles. Places to Raise Young: Butterflies need special plants to lay their eggs on. Frogs and toads lay eggs only  in shallow water. Many birds use birdhouses; others nest  in  trees and bushes.  In fact, nearly all your shelters may become homes for wild young. Put It on Paper Using the map you made of your area, draw in the changes you want to make. Mark where the plants, nest boxes, and other items will go. Remember, this is a long-term plan--you don't have  to  do  everything  this  spring. Maybe  you  could  put  up  a  few  birdhouses  and  plant  some butterfly bushes now and save the trees and bushes for next year. Even a small start is a big step for wildlife. Reach for Resources To make the habitat happen, you'll need lots of plants, seeds, and other supplies. You'll also need to buy or borrow tools and maybe even some heavy equipment. Now's the time to reach out for donations. Start by asking your parent-teacher organization. Then go to garden clubs, garden stores (they might give you a discount), local government agencies, and businesses. If they can't donate supplies or money, ask if they can donate workers! The workers can help build  the habitat. You'll also need people  to help maintain  it. Some schools ask their students' families to take turns during the summer. Each family maintains  the habitat for a couple of weeks. Build Your Design Now you can dig in. Set a date, and get growing! How has the author organized the article?",

      "question": "In its early history, Chicago had floods frequently, especially in the spring, making the streets so muddy that people, horses, and carts got stuck. An old joke that was popular at the time went something like this: A man is stuck up to his waist in a muddy Chicago street. Asked if he needs help, he replies, \"No, thanks. I've got a good horse under me.\" The city planner decided to build an underground drainage   system, but there simply wasn't enough difference between the height of the ground level and the water level. The only two options were to lower the Chicago River or raise the city. An engineer named Ellis Chesbrough convinced me the city that it had no choice but to build the pipes above ground and then cover them with dirt. This raised the level of the city's streets by as much as 12 feet. This of course created a new problem: dirt practically buried the first floors of every building in Chicago. Building owners were faced with a choice: either change the first floors of their buildings into basements, and the second stories into main floors, or _ the entire buildings to meet the new street level. Small wood-frame buildings could be lifted fairly easily. But what about large, heavy structures like Tremont Hotel, which was a six-story brick building? That's where George Pullman came in. He had developed some house-moving skills successfully. To lift a big structure like the Tremont Hotel, Pullman would place thousands of jackscrews   beneath the building's foundation. One man was assigned to operate each section of roughly 10 jackscrews. At Pullman's signal each man turned his jackscrew the same amount at the same time, thereby raising the building slowly and evenly. Astonishingly, the Tremont Hotel stay open during the entire operation, and many of its guests didn't even notice anything was happening. Some people like to say that every problem has a solution. But in Chicago's early history, every engineering solution seemed to create a new problem. Now that Chicago's waste water was draining efficiently into the Chicago River, the city's next step was to clean the polluted river. The author mentions the joke to show   _  .",

      "question": "SAN FRANCISCO -- In the western U.S., Hawaii and elsewhere across the globe, moon watchers were treated on Saturday to a rare celestial  phenomenon: a total lunar eclipse  . For about 50 minutes starting at 6:06 a.m. PST, the moon was completely blocked by the Earth's shadow. With only some indirect sunlight able to reach it after passing through the Earth's atmosphere, the moon took on a reddish weak light. Since the atmosphere scatters  blue light, only red light strikes the moon, giving it a dark red color1. Dally Sam, who runs a public relations firm in Hawaii, said it had been cloudy and rainy, but the weather cleared just in time for the eclipse. Around 3 a.m., he awoke, as he usually does, and remembered to step outside the house in time to catch the beginning of the eclipse about a half hour later. No one else in the neighborhood was up then. \"It was turning that dark red color1,\" Sayre, aged 47, said, \"I'd better get a camera. To be able to see it just right outside our house was really cool.\" At the local observatory in Los Angeles, some 300 people, many holding coffee cups in the cold morning air, sat with blankets and chairs on the observatory's great grass land. \"It's really a celestial festival out here,\" John Peter, aged 39, told the Los Angeles Times as he set up his camera. Lying on a slope  north of downtown near the Hollywood sign, the place offers clear views of the sky.

      "question": "Expressing emotions is important rather than hiding them or keeping them inside. Everyone feels negative emotions such as anger and needs to deal with them. But there are healthy ways to express anger and ways to control it. Shouting bad words at someone will hurt the other person or make them angry too. If you feel angry, it is best to think before you speak. Some people in the UK use the expression \"take a deep breath and count to 10\", meaning take a pause, breathe deeply and let yourself calm down instead of getting angry. Another expression people use to say they are controlling their anger is \"biting their lip\". This means not letting the bad words come out of their mouth. If you cannot think of anything but bad words, it is probably best to \"bite your lip.\" But sometimes letting all your anger out can be cathartic , as long as you do it at the right place and time. If you have just had a bad day, you could go into a room by yourself and scream or yell very loudly. Or if you want to hit someone or smash something, you could hit a pillow instead. Then after you let your frustration out this way, you'll be able to deal with your problems more calmly. If you do lose your temper with someone and swear at them, though, you need to apologize. One way to do this is to say \"pardon my French\". This expression has been used for many years as an apology for bad language. Then you can calmly explain what made you upset.

Beyond your genes Sonja, a professor of psychology at University of California Riverside, analyzed studies on identical twins and concluded that happiness is 50 percent genetic, 40 percent intentional and 10 percent circumstantial. \"Your circumstances-where you live, your health, your work, your marriage-can be tough to change .But most people are surprised that circumstances don't account for as much of their happiness as they think,\"she said. Life circumstances don't result in continuous happiness, she says, because we adapt.That new car, promotion or house feels great at first.Then we get used to it. Keeping that good feeling requires something else: control of how you act and think.                               Happiness definition To gain happiness, you need to understand what happiness is. Martin Seligman, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says happiness is the pursuit of engaging and meaningful activities.  By \"engaging\", he means when we get so absorbed in what we are doing that we lose track of time.\"Meaningful\" would be using what you are best at to serve others or to participate in a cause that's bigger than yourself.  \"Your purpose doesn't have to be giant,\" says psychologist Dan Baker. \"If you'reyou're your purpose can be getting into the college of your choice.When you're a parent, it can be getting your kids off to school safely and prepared for each day.

      "question": "Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed Wednesday that the socialist path China has followed is \"correct,\" and it is the choice of the \"history and people.\" Citing  the remarkable achievements China has made over the past 37 years when it initiated the reform and opening-up policy, Xi noted that it only took several decades for China to complete the journey the developed countries have gone through for centuries. \"That fully shows that the Chinese people are following a correct path,\" the president said while addressing a banquet hosted by Lord Mayor of the City of London Alan Yarrow on Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, he _ that China will stay committed to a peaceful development path and does not accept the logic that a country will seek hegemony(,) once it gets strong. \"No one and nothing -- in any reason -- can influence China's determination and will to pursue the path of peaceful development,\" he said. In his speech, the president also explained in detail about the development of friendly relations between China and Britain, citing tea culture, literature, movies, TV dramas, football and cultural exchanges. He specifically referred to Shakespeare's influence on him by sharing the story of his youth time in the countryside, when he was deeply attracted by the master's works. \"The China-Britain friendship has been deeply rooted in the hearts of our two peoples.

It's hard to believe, but you can find out a number of things about a woman's personality just by looking at the type of handbag she carries. Below you will find a number of handbag styles and colors as well as what each specific type of handbag says about the owner.

      "question": "On the night of July 6, 1943, a plane took off from an Air Force base in England to intercept   German fighters over the English Channel. Piloting the plane was Captain Thomas Nash. Looking westward, Nash saw twelve orange lights in a row, moving at a fantastic rate of speed. An old experienced flyer, he had never seen anything like them. Thinking they might be a new German weapon, he decided to give chase. But when he swung the plane around and headed directly for the lights, they disappeared.      Captain Nash may have been the first to see such orange lights but he wasn't the last. His experience was repeated many times by pilots during World WarIIboth in Europe and the Far East. Pilots in the Korean War also reported seeing the strange lights.      What were they? No one knows for sure, but there is an interesting theory to account for them. According to this theory, the orange lights are space animals -- animals specially adapted to life in the upper atmosphere just as some creatures are adapted to life at the bottom of the sea.     These space animals, the theory says, live so far up in the atmosphere that they are not visible from earth. They feed partly on the air and partly on energy from sunlight. Being almost pure energy themselves, they can adjust their bodies to glow   at night. During the day they become invisible.  Before World War II, continues the theory, there was little radiated   energy available on the earth's surface. Then came the development of rockets, atomic reactors  , and hydroelectric plants  . The space creatures are attracted to these sources of energy of food. At night when there is no energy from sunlight, they go down into the lower levels in search of a meal. They may even drift into the range of human eyesight. This explains the fact that they have been sighted regularly from the earth since 1943.

Fish that had been fried became soup. Her old shredded   potato turned into diced potato... Feeling strange, dad and I asked Mom the reason for the change. But all she said was, \"Just trying a different taste\". Then she was silent. But it wasn't just her cooking way. Mom also change other habits. After dinner, instead of watching films on TV as usual, she would put on her newly-bought sports clothes and asked Dad to go out for a walk. After they came back home, mom would lose herself in magazines or newspapers about healthcare. Mom almost never gets sick. Why was she suddenly interested in medicine? I couldn't understand her \"abnormal\" behavior.

      "question": "Dolphins are not fish. They are mammals  .They live in groups and speak to each other in their own language. But they are quite different from almost all land animals. Their brain is as big as men's and they live a long life at least 20 or 30 years. Like some animals, dolphins use sounds to help them find their way around. They also use these sounds to talk to each other and to help them find food. They do not use their ears to receive sounds,but use the jaw--the lower part of the mouth. It is strange that dolphins are friendly to men, and for thousands of years, there are many stories about dolphins and men. In the 19th century, in a dangerous part of the sea near New Zealand,there was a dolphin. The seamen liked him very much and gave him a very good name, Jack. From 1871 to 1903 ,Jack met every boat in the area and showed it the way. In 1903 a passenger on a boat with the name of The Penguin shot and hurt Jack. Luckily the dolphin didn't die, and after a long time he was well again. He guided the ships through the area for nine more years, but he refused to help the boat of the Penguin. Today, some people still kill dolphins, but many countries in the world now protect them. In these places, people are not allowed to kill them. Who was Jack?",

      "question": "If you want to become a fluent English speaker you should take some advice. There are four skills in learning English. They are reading, listening, speaking, and writing. The most important thing you must remember is that if you want to improve your speaking and writing skills, you should first master the skills of reading and listening. Read as much as you can. But your reading must be active. It means that you must think about the meaning of the sentence, the meaning of the unfamiliar words, etc. There is no need for you to pay much attention to grammars or try to understand all the unfamiliar words you _ , but the fact that you see them for the first time and recognize them whenever you see them, for example, in other passages or books, is enough. It would be better to prepare yourself a notebook so you can write down the important words or sentences in it. As for listening, there are two choices: besides reading, you can listen every day for about 30 minutes. You can only pay attention to your reading and become skillful at your reading, then you can catch up on your listening. Since you have lots of inputs in your mind, you can easily guess what the speaker is going to say. This never means that you should not practice listening. For listening you can listen to cartoons or some movies that are specially made for children. Their languages are easy. Or if you are good at listening you can listen to VOA or BBC programs every day. Again the thing to remember is being active in listening and preferably taking some notes. If you follow these pieces of advice, your speaking and writing will improve quickly, and you can be a fluent English speaker one day.

      "question": "A California family drives a car that could help protect the environment. When Jon and Sandy go to the store or to their daughters' soccer games, they drive in high-tech style. They drive a $1 million, fuel-cell-powered car. It may be the world's most expensive car and one of the most environmentally friendly cars. The FCX is the first fuel-cell-powered car to be used by a family anywhere in the world. The FCX uses hydrogen and oxygen for fuel. Car makers have been working to develop vehicles that are better for the environment. They are developing cars that use fuel other than gasoline. And then what is fuel cell technology? Fuel cell technology works by changing the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water. This process produces electricity, and water vapor which comes out of the exhaust pipe. Most cars release dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Many scientists say these gases are major contributors to global warming. \"The FCX is driven just like any other vehicle on the road, but without the gases which pollute the environment,\" scientists say. Fuel cell technology has been around since the 1800s, but scientists have yet been to perfect it. They say it may take years before the technology is ready for widespread use. Another earth-friendly car is already on the market. Hybrid cars use both gasoline and an electric motor. They are becoming more popular with customers because they cut pollution and improve fuel efficiency. Which of the following about the FCX is not true?",

What I wonder is why something even without legs causes such great fear. Snakes are quite useful, but that doesn't seem to matter. Snakes help control the population of mice. Without snakes, perhaps we would find mice everywhere. Most of us, however, would rather see a mouse than a snake. The poison argument   is a strong one. Some snakes are poisonous, and this causes people's death. However, the poisonous snakes are only a small number. We can't say all the snakes are bad just because of a few dangerous ones. And what do we do with the people who really like snakes? They like snakes even more strongly than we dislike them. These people learn about them, find them out, and watch them carefully. Why? The only reason I can think of is that these people are open-minded. They are able to put aside differences and welcome the snake as a friend. Whatever the reason for our like or dislike, snakes do something good in the circle of life. They would prefer to be left alone, and that is what we should do.

Martin was aware that colleagues approached these meetings with hidden agenda ; they indulged in  game playing; and he knew that people were not being honest and open.The meetings themselves were bad enough-there was all the moaning afterwards at the meeting like\"I could have improved on that idea,but I wasn't going to say\". As this morning's meeting began,Martin prepared himself for the usual dullness and boredom.But,as the meeting progressed,he became aware of a strange background noise.At first,he thought that he was still hearing the engine noise from the aircraft that had brought him back to London.But,as he concentrated on the noise,it became a little clearer. He realized,to his amazement,that he could actually hear what they were thinking at the same time as they were speaking.What surprised him,even more than the acquisition of this strange power,was that he discovered that what people were saying was not really what they were thinking.They were not making clear their reservations.They were not supporting views which they thought might be popular.They were not contributing their new insights.They were not volunteering their new ideas. Martin found it impossible not to respond to his new knowledge.So he started to make gentle interventions,based more on what he could hear his colleagues thinking than on what he could hear them saying.\"So,John,are you really saying...\"\"Susan,do you really think that?\"\"Tom,have you got an idea on how we could take this forward?\"They looked at him,puzzled.In truth,he felt rather proud of his newly-acquired talent. As the meeting progressed,it was clear to him that each member of the meeting was learning how to hear the thoughts of the others.The game playing started to fall away; people started to speak more directly; views became better understood; the atmosphere became more open and trusting. The meeting ended.As people left the room,Martin found that he could still hear what they were thinking.\"That was the best meeting we've ever had.\"\"All meetings should be like that.\"\"In future,I'm going to say what I think\".

For the first time, researchers have discovered a genetic recipe that accurately predicts who may live to 100 and beyond. Analysis shows that 90% of the participants who lived to 100 had at least one of the signature genetic clusters . Dr. Thomas Perls at the Boston University School of Medicine said, \"We realize this is a complex genetic puzzle. There is a long way for us to go to understand how the integration of these genes--not just with themselves but with environmental factors--is playing a role in this long life puzzle.\" Perls has studied many factors that contribute to long life, and he is the first to acknowledge that living longer isn't likely to be simply a matter of genes. His previous work has shown, for example, that among most elderly people who live into their 70s and 80s, about 70% can owe their long life to environmental factors such as not smoking; eating a healthy, low-fat, low-calorie diet; and remaining socially engaged and mentally active throughout life. It seems clear that those who live extremely long are benefiting from a special DNA. In fact, Perls believes that the older a person gets, the more likely it is that his or her genes are contributing to those extended years. Perls may most likely agree that  _  .",

      "question": "Everyone may all have the experience of feeling anxious and stressed when having a rough day or having some troubles. Different people may choose different ways to deal with it, and for most people a break for a 10-minute walk may be quite useful.www.zxxk.com Anyway, here is another way around: to get a piece of chewing gum, and chew it. According to a Swinburne University of Technology study, gum-chewing has been found to \"relieve anxiety, improve alertness  and reduce stress among individuals in a laboratory setting.\" Some may argue that a laboratory is not the same as an office. But check out the conditions of the study: individuals were monitored while performing \"a group of 'multi-tasking' activities.\" Doesn't it sound like the situation in the office?www.zxxk.com Here's a summary of some of the study's findings: Gum chewers showed a reduction in anxiety as compared to non-gum chewers by nearly 17 percent during mild stress and nearly 10 percent in appropriate stress. Gum chewers showed improvement in alertness over non-gum chewers by nearly 19 percent during mild stress and 8 percent in moderate stress. Improved Performance: Chewing gum resulted in a big improvement in overall performance on multi-tasking activities. Although these aren't major improvements, every little bit works and chewing a piece of gum is a lot quicker and easier than slipping outside for a 10-minute walk. So, how does gum work this magic? In part it does so by lowering the level of cortisol --a steroid  hormone that is released in response to stress in your system. A few words of advice before you reach for the gum: don't crack your gum, and be sure to chew it with your mouth closed. In fact, I'd say keep the gum out of meetings, because it really looks impolite to others around you. From the study in the text we know that  _  .",

The lizard had survived in such a position for 10 years! It has been in a dark wall partition for 10 years without moving! Then he wondered how this lizard survived for 10 years without moving a single step......since its foot was nailed! So he stopped his work and observed the lizard: what has it been doing?what and how has it been eating? Later, he didn't know from where another lizard appeared, with food in its mouch.Ah! He was astonished and touched deeply. The free lizard had been feeding the stuck one for the past 10 years...... Such love, a beautiful love! Such love happened with this tiny creature... What can love do? It can do wonders! Just think about it: one lizard had been feeding the other one untiringly for 10 long years, without giving up hope on its partner. If a small creature like a lizard can love like this... just imagine how we can love if we try. How did the Japanese feel when seeing the stuck lizard?",

      "question": "My family and I lived across the street from Southway Park since I was four years old. Then just last year the city put a chain link fence around the park and started bulldozing the trees and grass to make way for a new apartment complex. When I saw the fence and bulldozers, I asked myself,\"Why don't they just leave it alone?\" Looking back, I think what sentenced the park to oblivion was the drought we had about four years ago. Up until then, Southway Park was a nice green park with plenty of trees and a public swimming pool. My friends and I rollerskated on the sidewalks, climbed the trees, and swam in the pool all the years I was growing up. The park was almost like my own yard. Then the summer I was fifteen the drought came and things changed. There had been almost no rain at all that year. The city stopped watering the park grass. Within a few weeks I found myself living across the street from a huge brown desert. Leaves fell off the park trees, and pretty soon the trees started dying, too. Next, the park swimming pool was closed. The city cut down on the work force that kept the park, and pretty soon it just got too ugly and dirty to enjoy anymore. As the drought lasted into the fall, the park got worse every month. The rubbish piled up or blew across the brown grass. Soon the only people in the park were beggars and other people down on their luck. People said drugs were being sold or traded there now. The park had gotten scary, and my mother told us kids not to go there anymore. The drought finally ended and things seemed to get back to normal, that is, everything but the park. It had gotten into such bad shape that the city just let it stay that way. Then about six months ago I heard that the city was going to\"redevelop\"certain wornout areas of the city. It turned out that the city had planned to get rid of the park, sell the land and let someone build rows of apartment buildings on it. The chainlink fencing and the bulldozers did their work. Now we live across the street from six rows of apartment buildings. Each of them is three units high and stretches a block in each direction. The neighborhood has changed without the park. The streets I used to play in are jammed with cars now. Things will never be the same again.   _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _ How did the writer feel when he saw the fence and bulldozers?",

      "question": "\"Experience may possibly be the best teacher, but it is not a particularly good teacher.\" You might think that Winston Churchill or perhaps Mark Twain spoke those words, but they actually come from James March, a professor at Stanford University and a pioneer in the field of organizational decision making. For years March (possibly be wisest philosopher of management) has studied how humans think and act, and he continues to do so in his new bookThe Ambiguities of Experience. He begins by reminding us of just how firmly we have been sticking to the idea of experiential learning: \"Experience is respected;experience is sought;experience is explained.\" The problem is that learning from experience involves serious complications  , ones that are part of the nature of experience itself and which March discusses in the body of this book. In one interesting part of the book, for example, he turns a doubtful eye toward the use of stories as the most effective way of experiential learning. In our efforts to make stories interesting, he argues, we lose part of the complicated truth of things. He says \"The more accurately reality is presented, the less understandable the story, and the more understandable the story, the less realistic it is.\" Besides being a broadly knowledgeable researcher, March is also a poet, and his gift shines through in the depth of views he offers and the simple language he uses. Though the book is short, it is demanding: Don't pick it up looking for quick, easy lessons. Rather, be ready to think deeply about learning from experience in work and life.

      "question": "In 1977, Irene Pepperberg of Harvard University began studying what was on another creature's mind by talking to it. Her first experiments began with Alex. Alex was a one-year-old African grey parrot and Irene taught him to produce the sounds of the English language. \"I thought if he learned to communicate, I could ask him questions about how he sees the world.\" At the time, most scientists didn't believe animals had any thoughts. They thought animals were more like robots but didn't have the ability to think or feel. Of course, if you own a pet you probably disagree. But it is the job of a scientist to prove this and nowadays more scientists accept that animals can think for themselves. \"That's why I started my studies with Alex,\" Irene said, \"Some people actually called me crazy for trying this.\" Nowadays, we have more and more evidence that animals have all sorts of mental abilities. Sheep can recognize faces. Chimpanzees   use a variety of tools and even use weapons to hunt. And Alex the parrot became a very good talker. Thirty years after the Alex studies began. Irene was still giving him English lessons up until his recent death. For example, if Alex was hungry he could say \"want grape\". Alex could count to six and was learning the sounds for seven and eight. \"He has to hear the words over and over before he can correctly say them.\" Irene said, after pronouncing \"seven\" for Alex a few times in a row. Alex could also tell the difference between colors, shapes, sizes, and materials (e.g. wood and metal). Before he finally died, Alex managed to say \"seven\". Another famous pet that proved some animals have greater mental skills was a dog called Rico. He appeared on a German TV game show in 2011. Rico knew the names of 200 different toys and easily learned the names of new ones. When Rico became famous, many other dog owners wanted to show how clever their pets were. Another dog called Betsy could understand 300 words. One theory for dogs' ability to learn a language is that they have ben close companions to humans for many centuries and so their ability to understand us is constantly evolving  . While animals can't do what humans do yet, some scientists believe that examples like Alex and Rico prove that evolution develops intelligence, as well as physical appearance.

Now, four scientists say they have discovered something in lava that will help do this. They did the research on Mount Unzen on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu.  Mount Unzen exploded in November, 1990. Since then, more explosions have killed 43 people and destroyed the homes of more than 2,000 others. The volcano is still active today.  The scientists say the lava of the volcano contains high level of an element ,which is a sign of the presence of the lava from deep in the earth, not from the surface. They say it shows that the lava coming directly from inside the earth is connected with huge explosions instead of smaller ones.  The scientists examined the lava from 18 explosions of Mount Unzen that took place during many thousands of years. They also studied the lava from other volcanoes in the area that are older than Mount Unzen. The lava studied came from both large and small explosions. The scientists found that large explosions contained more of the element than small ones. The scientists say if they had known this two years earlier, they could have warned the people living in the area near Mount Unzen and saved many lives.

My grandmother died just over two years ago. At 91, she had spent 30 years without her right leg, which was removed due to cancer the year I was born. She was a poet, an artist, a food lover and a salt cellar collector. The funny thing about the salts, as she called them -- I never once heard her say salt cellar -- was that although everybody knew they were her hobby and everyone was always searching for them at yard sales or in stores, nobody seemed to know what they meant to her and they just wanted to make her happy. Grandma kept her salts in a dark wooden corner display case in the living room. Since her death the case has remained exactly as she left it. Grandpa tries his best to preserve his memories of her just as they are.  Now I am collecting, too. Collecting memories about my grandmother's hobby, a way she spent her time. And as I hold one of them in my hand, I picture her holding it in her hand on the day she got it. She is smiling. My mother and her two sisters all have small collections, but my mother admits that she was more interested in finding salts to send to Grandma.  Grandma once wrote a poem titled \"When April Comes\". The poem contains the line, \"When April comes and I am not around, remember me when daffodils are found.\" Now, Grandpa is working on a poem with the line, \"April came and you were not around\".

They were told that these five were the most excellent students in the class. But the fact was that these students were only average ,and they were not the best students at all. Well, guess what? At the end of the year, all the five average students scored among the highest in the class. What made these average students change so much to become top students?The only difference was the change in their teachers' attitude . Because the teachers believed that these five kids were the top students,they expected  more from them. And so these five average students began to believe and expect more from themselves. So they worked harder to do as well as they could. Do you know why? If you expect the best from people, they'll usually want to give you their best. A great leader said, \"Treat  a person just how he appears to be on the outside, and you'll make him even worse. But treat a person like he's already a success,and you'll help make him the best he can be.\" Like the true story of 7-year-old Johnny, his teacher got so angry with him that one day she said,\"Johnny,you're the naughtiest  boy in this class.

But do you know that I don't believe a word of it.\" And every day after that, this new teacher treated Johnny as if he was one of the smartest students even when Johnny did naughty things.

      "question": "The English expect each other to observe the rules of queuing, feel highly offended when these rules are broken, but lack the confidence or social skills to express their annoyance in a straightforward manner. In other countries, this is not a problem: in America, where a queue-jumper has committed a kind of rudeness rather than a sin, the response is a loud warning: the offender is simply told \"Hey, you, get back in line!\" or words to that effect. On the European continent, the reaction tends to be loud and argumentative; in some other parts of the world, queue-jumpers may simply be pushed back into line. Ironically  , it is only in England, where queue-jumping is regarded as deeply immoral, that the queue-jumper is likely to get away with the offence. Only rarely do the English actually speak up and tell the jumper to go to the back of the queue. Queuing is almost a national pastime for the English, who automatically arrange themselves into orderly lines at bus stops, shop counters, ice-cream vans, entrances, exits, and lifts. In 1946, a Hungarian humorist described queuing as English \"national passion\". \"On the continent,\" he said. \"if people are waiting at a bus stop they walk around in a seemingly relaxed fashion. When the bus arrives they make a dash   for it...An Englishman, even if he is alone, forms orderly queue of one.\" In an update over thirty years later in 1977 he confirmed that this was still the case. After nearly another thirty years nothing much seems to have changed. In many cases, queue-jumping is effectively prevented by non-verbal   signals alone. When someone is considering jumping a queue, the queuers will start glancing at him sideways, through narrowed, suspicious eyes. Then they move a bit closer to the person in front of them, just in case the jumper might try to insert himself in the gap. Frowns, glares, and raised eyebrows -- accompanied by heavy sighs, pointed coughs -- are usually the worst that the person will suffer if he jumps a queue. Faced with all this, the jumper will think better of it and withdraw to the back of the queue. What is the best title of this passage?",

      "question": "People with mentally taxing jobs, including lawyers and graphic designers, may end up having better memory in old age, research suggests. A study of more than 1,000 Scottish 70-year-olds found that those who had had complex jobs scored better on memory and thinking tests. One theory is that a more stimulating environment helps build up a \"cognitive reserve\" to help buffer the brain against age-related decline. The research was reported in Neurology. The team, from Heriot-Watt University, in Edinburgh, is now planning more work to look at how lifestyle and work interact to affect memory loss. Those taking part in the study took tests designed to assess memory, processing speed and general thinking ability, as well as filling in a questionnaire about their working life. The analysis showed that those whose jobs had required complex skills in dealing with data or people, such as management and teaching, had better scores on memory and thinking tests than those who had done less mentally intense jobs such as factory workers, bookbinders, or carpet layers. While the study did not look at biological reasons for the protective effect of certain jobs, potential explanations include that structural changes within the brain mean less damage is accumulated over time. Study leader Dr Alan Gow said: \"Our findings have helped to identify the kinds of job demands that preserve memory and thinking later on.\" \"However,\" He added, \"while it is true that people who have higher cognitive abilities are more likely to get more complex jobs, there still seems to be a small advantage gained from these complex jobs for later thinking skills.\" Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the study added to the growing evidence about factors that affected brain health as we aged. \"Keeping the brain active throughout life could be helpful and different types of work may play a role. However, it's important to note that this study points to a small and subtle association between occupation and later-life cognition rather than offering proof that people's occupation has a direct influence.\" According to the research, who may have the best memory in old age?",

People who increased their intake over just six weeks developed a healthy glow and appeared more attractive, researchers found. Scientists at St Andrews University found eating them subtly increased yellow and red pigments in the volunteers' skin. They monitored the food intake of 35 people and took pictures of their faces, arms and hands using a sensitive camera at the start, and after three and six weeks. Increasing their intake of greens by 2.9 portions a day was found to make the person look healthier and an extra 3.3 portion could enhance their attractiveness, when their photographs were rated by others. Fruit and vegetables are rich in carotenoids , which are known to protect against cell damage from pollution and UV rays, and can also prevent age-related diseases including heart disease and cancer. But while it was known eating extreme amounts of certain vegetables such as carrots could turn skin orange, it was not known a small increase was perceptible to others and was seen as  _ . A camera measured changes to the skin's redness, yellowness and lightness, and found it significantly changed in people who naturally increased their intake.

      "question": "During the past Spring Festival, many children may have received red packets from their families. But Xing Pu, a 40-year-old economist, is asking the government to give red packets to every Chinese citizen. Xing suggested the government give out 1,000 Yuan to each Chinese since the government income has increased rapidly in recent years. He said his suggestion would allow everyone to directly enjoy the fruits of the country's economic success, help the lower-income groups deal with rising prices and increase consumption around the country. Recent years have seen the government carry out a series of pro-poor   and pro-rural policies, including increasing spending on public healthcare and calling off the agricultural tax. But the lower-income group still needs more help while being hit hard by an 11-year high in prices and recent snowstorms. Xing said while making the draft, he has borrowed many ideas from practices in countries like the United States and Singapore. Earlier this year, the governments of the two nations offered cash handouts to their citizens as the result of a surplus in government income. As for in China, \"We can even encourage the rich to donate their 1,000 Yuan red packet to the poor,\" said Xing. Although Xing's suggestion has gained wide support among ordinary Chinese on the Internet, many other economists criticized it as unpractical. Even Xing himself admitted he made the suggestion without any careful calculation. But they agreed with Xing's point that the growing economic pie should be shared among the people. \"To better use the increase of money, handing out money is not a solution that holds good for all time. It could be better to improve the public service or cut the price of energy use in daily life,\" said Qiao Xinsheng, an economic professor.

Some people are concerned that the pressure on your knees and ankles can be _ . While this can be true, there are many things that you can do to reduce your risk of injury. You should always go to a doctor for advice before you begin any type of exercise program. Then, a good pair of running shoes can be helpful as your feet hit the ground. They will help protect your ankles by providing stability to your feet. So it is good idea to visit a specialty  running shoe store.

In order to learn the proper form, you may get some advice from a friend who has been running for some time, or even join a running club. They can provide good tips as well as some support and encouragement for you. Lastly, it is important to start out slowly. When it comes to getting in shape and losing weight , short bursts of speed followed by periods of slower movement would be proper. Aim for around 30 minutes of exercise a few days a week. As you get better, you can increase your speed. Always allow your body to rest in between heavy exercise as your muscles need time to bring energy back.

      "question": "Do women's minds work the same as men's? Absolutely not. At least, that is what most men are convinced of. Psychologists view the subject either as a matter or frustration or a joke. Now the biologists have moved into this minefield, and some of them have found that there are real differences between the brains of men and women. But being different, they point out hurriedly, is not the same as being better or worse. There is, however, a definite structural variation between the male and female brain. The difference is in a part of the brain that is used in the most complex intellectual processes-the link between the two halves of the brain. The two halves are linked by a trunkline of between 200 and 300 million nerves, the corpus callosum. Scientists have found quite recently that the corpus callosum in women is always larger and probably richer in nerve fibres than it is in men. This is the first time that a structural difference has been found between the brains of women and men and it must have some significance. The question is \"What?\", and, if this difference exists, are there others? Research shows that present-day women think differently and behave differently from men. Are some of these differences biological and inborn, a result of evolution? We tend to think that is the influence of society that produces these differences. But could we be wrong? Research showed that these two halves of the brain had different functions, and that the corpus callosum enabled them to work together. For most people, the left half is used for word handing, analytical and logical activities; the right half works on pictures, patterns and forms. We need both halves working together. And the better the connections, the more harmoniously the two halves work. And, according to research findings, women have the better connections. But it isn't all that easy to explain the actual differences between skills of men and women on this basis. In schools throughout the world girls tend to be better than boys at \"language subjects\" and boys better at maths and physics. If these differences correspond with the differences in the hemispheric trunkline, here is an unalterable distinction between the sexes. We shan't know for a while, partly because we don't know of any precise relationship between abilities in school subject and the functioning of the two halves of the brain, and we cannot understand how the two halves interact via the corpus callosum. But this striking difference must have some effect and, because the difference is in the parts of the brain involved in intellect, we should be looking for differences in intellectual processing.

      "question": "For some years the big drugmakers have been worrying about an approaching \"patent cliff\"--a fall in sales as the patents on their most popular pills expire or are struck down by legal challenges, with few new potential _ to take their place. This week the patent on the best-selling drug in history expired--Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol pill which earned Pfizer nearly $11 billion in revenues last year.In all, pill like Lipitor with a combined $170 billion in annual sales will go off-patent by the end of 2015. What is supposed to happen now is that lots of copycat firms rush in with \"generic\" (ie, chemically identical) versions of Lipitor at perhaps one-fifth of its price.Patients and health-care payers should reap the benefit.Pfizer's revenues should suffer. The same story will be repeated many times, as other best-selling drugs march over the patent cliff But generics makers may face delays getting their cheaper versions to market.Ranbaxy, a Japanese-owned drugmaker, struggled to get regulators' approval for its generic version of Lipitor, and only won it on the day the patent expired.More importantly, research-based drug firms are using a variety of tactics to make the patent cliff slope more gently. Jon Leibowitz, chairman of America's Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is concerned by drugmakers filing additional patents on their products to put off the day when their protection expires. Another tactic  is \"pay-for-delay\", in which a drugmaker facing a legal challenge to its patent pays its would-be competitor to put off introducing its cheaper copy. In the year to October the FTC identified what it believes to be 28 such settlements. American and European regulators are looking into these deals. However, legal challenges against them have been delayed, and a bill to ban them is stuck in Congress. To encourage generics makers to challenge patents on drugs, and introduce cheaper copies, an American law passed in 1984 says that the first one to do so will get a 180-day exclusivity period,in which no other generics maker can sell versions of the drug in question, as Ranbaxy supposedly won with Lipitor. However, Pfizer is exploiting a loophole  in the 1984 law, which lets it appoint a second, authorised copycat--in this case, Watson, another American firm.According to BernsteinResearch, under the deal between the two drugmakers Pfizer will receive about 70% of Watson's revenues from its approved copy of Lipitor.More unusual, Pfizer has cut the price of its original version, and will keep marketing it vigorously. So Ranbaxy faces not one, but two competitors. All this may raise Pfizer's sales by nearly $500m in the last half of 2015 compared with what they would otherwise have been, says Tim Anderson of BernsteinResearch, with revenues then falling after the 180 days are over. Others fear that Pfizer's tactics , if copied, will make the 180-day exclusivity period worth far less, and thus discourage generic firms from challenging patents in the first place.

He became famous when he became the first person to produce lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)  . In addition, he was also the first person to taste it and learn about its hallucinogenic   effects. He was deeply connected to the nature and argued that LSD, besides being useful for psychiatry , could also be used to promote awareness of mankind's place in nature.

And you'd also expect Japanese people to be extremely positive, seeing as though they have the highest life expectancy. But clearly wealth and good health do not guarantee happiness after both countries failed to make the top ten most positive countries. The poll ( ) of nearly 150,000 people around the world found that seven of the world's 10 countries with the most upbeat attitudes are in Latin America. _ asked about 1,000 people in each of 148 countries if they were wellrested, had been treated with respect, smiled or laughed a lot, learned or did something interesting and felt feelings of enjoyment the previous day. In Panama and Paraguay, 85 percent of those polled said yes to all five, putting those countries at the top of the list. They were followed  closely  by  El Salvador,  Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Thailand, Guatemala, the Philippines, Ecuador and Costa Rica. The people least likely to report positive emotions lived in Singapore, the wealthy and orderly citystate that ranks among the most developed in the world. Other wealthy countries also sat surprisingly low on the list. Germany and France tied with the poor African state of Somaliland for 47th place. Many of the seven countries which were most positive do poorly in traditional measures of wellbeing, like Guatemala, a country torn by decades of civil war followed by waves of gangdriven criminality that give it one of the highest killing rates in the world.

It's happened to me a few times, but two instances really stand out. A few years ago, I was dining in a restaurant with a friend who kept talking about himself, completely not aware of the fact that I was sitting there in misery. It wasn't my friend's talks that made me suffer. I was recovering from a broken heart, and just sitting down to dinner reminded me of my last relationship. I could have burst into tears right there at the table. When we picked up the check, the waitress said, \" Your meal was already paid for .\" My friend and I didn't have a clue how it happened. Then I remembered a man I saw out of the corner of my eye. He was dressed in mostly white, sat down at the bar, had a beer, and stayed for maybe ten minutes. The waitress said, \"Yes, the gentleman in white paid for you .\" It felt like an angel was saying \"I see you, honey. It's going to be okay.\" Just last year, I was running a half-marathon. With just 1 mile to go, I was out of gas. Runners call it \" _ \". I thought I couldn't move another inch. Out of nowhere, a stranger came up to me and said, \"What's your name, sweetie? Jennifer? Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!\" And he ran with me until I picked up my pace. I found him at the finish line to thank him for the encouragement only to learn he wasn't even supposed to be in the race that day.

      "question": "Scratchy throats, stuffy noses and body aches all spell misery, but being able to tell if the cause is a cold or flu may make a difference in how long the misery lasts. The American Lung Association (ALA) has issued new guidelines on combating colds and the flu , and one of the keys is being able to quickly tell the two apart. That's because the prescription drugs available for the flu need to be taken soon after the illness sets in. As for colds, the sooner a person starts taking over-the-counter remedy, the sooner relief will come. The common cold and the flu are both caused by viruses. More than 200 viruses can cause cold symptoms, while the flu is caused by three viruses - flu A, B and C. There is no cure for either illness , but the flu can be prevented by the flu vaccine, which is, for most people, the best way to fight the flu, according to the ALA. But if the flu does strike, quick action can help. Although the flu and common cold have many similarities , there are some obvious signs to look for. Cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose and scratchy throat typically develop gradually, and adults and teens often do not get a fever. On the other hand, fever is one of the characteristic features of the flu for all ages. And in general, flu symptoms including fever and chills, sore throat and body aches come on suddenly and are more severe than cold symptoms. The ALA notes that it may be particularly difficult to tell when infants and preschool age children have the flu. It advises parents to call the doctor if their small children have flu-like symptoms. Both cold and flu symptoms can be eased with over-the-counter medications as well. However, children and teens with a cold or flu should not take aspirin for pain relief because of the risk of Reye syndrome  ,a rare but serious condition of the liver and central nervous system. There is, of course, no vaccine for the common cold. But frequent hand washing and avoiding close contact with people who have colds can reduce the likelihood of catching one.

      "question": "HOUSTON (AP) --- A 10-year-old boy fatally shot his father Friday, striking him several times as he sat in the front seat of a SUV to pick up the boy from his mother's home for a weekend visit. The incident happened about 3pm on a cul-desac in the 1700 block of Cedar Cove Court, said Sgt. Williams of the Harris County Sheriff's Department. An investigation found that Rick James Lohstroh, 41, was shot by his son, who was sitting in the back seat of the man's Toyota 4-Runner, said Sgt. Williams. The shooting took place outside the home of Lohstroh's ex-wife, where the boy lives with his mother and a 7-year-old brother. \"We're not certain of anything until we finish our investigation,\" Williams said. \"The information we have at this time is that the 10-year-old did fire the weapon.\" The mother and the 7-year-old were inside the house when the shooting occurred, said Williams. Williams said the gun belonged to the boy's mother. After firing shots through the back seat, the boy exited the back of the vehicle and continued to fire at the car. The man died on the way to Memorial Herman Hospital. Lohstroh was a doctor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. The man and woman shared custody of the children. Williams said the mother and the boy were still in the home talking to investigators Friday night. Neighbors described the family as being quiet and keeping to themselves.

      "question": "Every evening, 15-year-old Rashida returns home from school, changes out of her uniform, and rushes to a neighboring farm to help her mother harvest vegetables. Her father is disabled, so the modest profit the two of them earn must cover food, clothing and other necessities for all seven children and their parents. Despite having precious little time to study, Rashida is one of the top students at her junior secondary school. But with so much responsibility on her small shoulders, she admits that it is sometimes hard for her to imagine a more promising future. Last year, Rashida was invited to join 155 other girls at Camfed Ghana's first Girls' Career Camp, a program designed to inspire girls growing up in the country's Northern Region to dream big, and to support them to pursue those dreams. \"We organized this camp because we wanted to let girls know that even if they are struggling with poverty, their lives will not be defined by limitations,\" says Dolores Dickson, Camfed Ghana's Executive Director. Over the course of five days, the camp led the junior and secondary school students through a range of experiences and career opportunities that were entirely new to them. Dr. Agnes Apusiga, a lecturer from the University of Development Studies, ran the workshop on goal-setting and career choices, describing the universities and training colleges in Ghana that could help them achieve their dreams. Participants then visited the University for Development Studies, where they toured the medical school and science labs. Another highlight was a workshop at the computer lab at Tamale Secondary School. Many of the girls had studied information technology from a book but had never before seen a computer. \"When the girls arrived at camp, they were not ambitious, because they didn't have any idea what the world held for them,\" says Eugenia Ayagiba, Project Officer with Camfed Ghana. \"Many had scarcely traveled beyond their own villages.\" \"I think the most important thing that happened at the camp is that we opened a window of hope for a group of girls coming from backgrounds of poverty,\" says Eugenia. For Rashida, who has been laughed at in the past by her schoolmates because of her father's disability, the experience was important. \"She told one of the camp mentors  that when she is at school, she often feels like a misfit, and she prefers to keep to herself,\" says Eugenia. \"But at the camp, it was different. She made friends with girls who have similar struggles. She took part in every single activity, every single game. On the last day, she said to her mentor, \"The camp has challenged me to study hard. Now I see that there is light at the end of the tunnel.\" How many members are there in Rashida's family?",

      "question": "Note: 1gigawtt =\" 1000\" megawatts SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple is cleaning up its manufacturing operations in China to reduce the air pollution caused by the factories that have assembled   hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads during the past eight years. The world's most valuable company is working with its Chinese suppliers to eventually produce 2.2 gigawatts of solar power and other renewable energy. The commitment announced Wednesday represents Apple's latest attempt to prevent the popularity of its devices and digital services from increasing the carbon emissions that are widely believed to change the Earth's climate. Apple Inc. estimates   20 million tons of greenhouse gas pollution will be avoided as more of its suppliers rely on renewable energy between now and 2020. That's like having four million fewer cars on the road for a year. Panels capable of generating   about 200 megawatts of solar power will be financed by Apple in the northern, southern and eastern regions of China, where many of its suppliers are located. The company is teaming up with its Chinese suppliers to build the capacity for the remaining 2 gigawatts of renewable energy, which will be a mix of solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Foxconn, which runs the factory where the most iPhones are assembled, is pledging to contribute 400 megawatts of solar power as part of the 2-gigawatt commitment. The solar panels to be built by 2018 in China's Henan Province are supposed to produce as much renewable energy as Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory consumes while making iPhones. Apple has made protecting the environment a higher priority since Tim Cook replaced the late Steve Jobs as the company's CEO four years ago. \"Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, and the time for action is now,\" Cook said in a statement. \"The transition to a new green economy requires innovation, ambition and purpose.\" Apple just completed projects in China that generate 40 megawatts of solar energy to cover the power required by its 24 stores and 19 offices in the country. All of Apple's data centers, offices and stores in the U.S. already have been running on renewable energy. \"When you look at all the air pollution in China, all the manufacturing that is done there has a lot to do with it, so this is a significant step in the right direction,\" said Gary Cook, a senior analyst for Greenpeace, a group devoted to protecting the environment. Apple also has a financial motivation to help make China a better place to live. The greater China region is Apple's second biggest market behind the U.S. Tim Cook has made it clear that he wants the company to make even more progress as rising incomes enable more of China's population to buy smart phones and other gadgets. Apple can easily afford to go green. The company had $203 billion in cash at the end of June. This story has been reflected to correct that Apple and its suppliers haven't set a timetable for producing the 2.2 gigawatts of renewable energy in China.

If you come to visit, you'll probably be surprised when you come in: Someone will give you an electronic PIN to wear. The PIN tells the house who you are and where you are. The house uses this information to give you what you need. When it's dark outside, the PIN turns on the lights near you, and then turns them off as you walk away from them. Music moves with you, too. If the house knows your favorite music, it plays it for you. The music seems to be everywhere, but in fact other people in the house hear different music or no music. If you get a telephone call, only the nearest telephone rings. Of course, you are also able to want something. There is a home control console   which is a small machine that turns things on and off around you. The PIN and the console are new ideas, but they are in fact like many things we have today.

      "question": "The social sciences, as the name shows, are the scientific study of the behavior of human beings, both in groups and individually. There is no past or present information of human beings who were not in groups. The groups may be small, like the family, or large, like a city or nation. But in order to reach complete development, man must be a member of a society. It is true that some individuals are more solitary than others. Some like monks or hermits may decide, for religious or other reasons, to leave their society and live alone. But these are unusual individuals, and even they cannot separate themselves completely from the rest of mankind. A society, then, seems to be the natural environment of mankind. Scholars who study mankind in social organizations are called social scientists.  The human behavior which social scientists study is learned behavior. The behavior of the human body as a living organism is studied by the biologist, the biochemist, or the physician. This behavior of man's physical body is inherited through the genetic development of his species. For example, all physically normal and healthy humans learn to walk as their bodies grow and develop. Social scientists concern themselves with the behavior that man must learn so that he can take his place in a social group. In order to be a functioning member of that group, each member must learn to behave in a way acceptable according to the differences among societies. The social scientists are newcomers to academic studies. By the end of the 19th century, the natural sciences had developed a method, by which they were able to understand the physical world. By using the scientific method, chemists, physicists, and astronauts, for example, learned a great deal about the universe. It seemed reasonable to apply the same method to the study of man's social life. Through this kind of study man may learn to understand himself much better. The scientific method is a way of collecting facts in order to describe an existing situation as correctly and completely as possible. The description must consist only of what can be perceived , analyzed, measured and recorded. Feelings and personal opinions or ideas have no place in scientific description. The fact must be observed and described in such a way that another scientist could repeat the same study and get the same results. How does a social behavior differ from physical behavior?",

      "question": "Music for Little Mozarts is a programme designed to help your little ones develop a love of music. Learning music at an early age helps develop minds and expand cognitive   ability. While listening to music can certainly help your youngster pick up songs, actually learning to play the piano can help your child's development. This programme focuses on little creatures that both entertain and teach. By grasping the attention of a young child's mind and engaging them with stories along with hands on experience, you can provide them with a positive experience that may produce a little Mozart in later years. Within this multi-book and multi-year lesson plan there are ten little characters that help draw the child into the lesson plan. These little creatures actually can be used to help the child grasp basic concepts in music. The series starts out in the preschool years and provides day by day lessons that can aid the child or a classroom of children right through early adolescence  . The series is designed for both classroom and preschool use and for those at home with homeschoolers. It contains a series of books along with audio CD's, flash cards, and other visual aids that can help very young children develop an ear and an eye for music. It can be hard to hold the attention spans of children for very long. However, with the right creativity and the proper attention along with simple, easy to master daily lessons, most children will not only grasp music rather quickly, they will also develop a love of real music, not just banging on a piano keyboard and making sounds. The short, daily lessons are planned out so that children learn to play music by ear. They learn to play real songs and master real passages quickly and easily. This element keeps them involved. They also master playing by ear and then later by reading rather quickly. We can infer that this programme was developed for_.",

Some students' mobile phones are stolen, some students fight with and hurt one another, and others are knocked down by the fast running bikes or cars. These problems arc common on campus. I think there are three causes for these. Firstly, some students do not take good care of their properties. They are still young and not careful enough. Secondly, some students want to do everything well. They want to be the winners in exams, and they also want to be the winners in fightings.  And thirdly, the campus guards do not carry on their duties well. They don' t regulate the traffic in the busy hour. In order to have a secure campus, all the students should be very careful about their properties. They should also mind their behaviors  and act politely. The campus guards are supposed to be devoted  to the security on campus, and it is their duty to safeguard  a secure campus to help provide a good environment for the students.

There was nothing to be done but to find another hotel. The waiters were happy to find me a new hotel , and when I said that I was happy to stay at the airport , thinking it might be cheaper than staying in the city , they suggested the Holiday Inn at the airport . There was one small matter : the room rate was $ 300 per night . The best hotel in Katoomba had wanted only $ 145 . I asked if there was anything cheaper they might suggest but they warned that most hotels would already be full by this time. The hotel was far from the train station , so I had to take a taxi , at $ 25 . On the way to the Holiday Inn , we passed a hotel just two blocks from the Holiday Inn that advertised a room rate of $ 104 . At the desk I asked if their room rate could go down a lot . \" No , this is a 4-star hotel,\" the waiter told me . \" In that case ,\" I replied , \" I'll just walk the two blocks to the cheap hotel.\" But she warned me that they were probably full and that if I didn't take the room , it might not be available when I came back .

      "question": "While watching the Olympics the other night, I came across an unbelievable sight. It was not a gold medal, or a world record broken, but a show of courage. The event was swimming and started with only three men on the blocks. For one reason or another, two of them false started, so they were disqualified. That left only one to compete. It would have been difficult enough, not having anyone to race against, even though the time on the clock is important. I watched the man dive off the block and knew right away that something was wrong. I'm not an expert swimmer, but I can tell a good dive from a poor one, and this was not exactly medal quality. When he resurfaced, it was evident that the man was not out for gold - his arms were waving in an attempt at freestyle. The crowd started to laugh. Clearly this man was not a medal competitor. I listened to the crowd begin to laugh at this poor man who was clearly having a hard time. Finally he made his turn to start back. It was pitiful. He made a few desperate strokes and you could tell he was worn out. But in those few awful strokes, the crowd had changed. No longer were they laughing, but beginning to cheer. Some even began to stand and shout \"Come on, you can do it!\" and he did. A clear minute past the average swimmer, this young man finally finished his race. The crowd went wild. You would have thought that he had won the gold, and he should have. Even though he recorded one of the slowest times in Olympic history, this man gave more heart than any of the other competitors. Just a short year ago, he had never even swum, let alone race. His country had been invited to Sydney.

The social connections may help in the future.\" The latest report from the US-based institute of International Education said China, for the first time, has become the top country of origin for international students in the United States. For Yang Fan, a journalism student, said studying in the United States is a way to escape the competition for places in China's top universities. \"Due to limited education resources, only about 60 percent of high school graduates in China enter college, and a much lower rate enters the top-level ones. \"A foreign degree will definitely help when I seek a job in China,\" Yang said. Both Yang's and Luo's parents are supportive of them studying abroad. Neither of them is thinking of settling down in the United States after graduation. \"It is not realistic to do so. As a journalism student, there would be no advantage for me to work in the United States,\" Yang said. \"But in China, with a US degree and good English, I may stand out against other students who have only studied in China.\" China still needs to improve its environment for scientists and high-level talents, said Xiao Mingzheng, director of the Center for Human Resource Development and Management Research of Peking University, adding that, in particular, the country needs to improve its policies relating to research environments.

Children remember and learn from mistakes when their own dollars are lost or spent foolishly. How large an allowance is suitable? Experts say there is not right amount. Actual amounts differ from region to region, and from family to family. To set an suitable allowance for your child, work up a weekly plan. Allow for entertainment costs such as movies and snacks. Next, include everyday expenses such as lunch money, bus fare, school supplies. \"If you make the child responsible for these bills',\" says Josephine Swanson, a consumer specialist, \" he or she will learn to plan for necessary costs.\" Finally, add some extra money to make saving possible. If you can keep your child's allowance in line with that of his friends. A child whose buying power falls away below his peers' can feel left out. It can be tough, but don't excuse your children when they make a mistake with their allowance.

But I finally realized that she was trying to teach me an important lesson. \" Experts advise that an allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily housework at home.

She chose bridge players because the game includes skills stimulating  a part of the brain called the dorsolateral cortex. Earlier animal research suggests that this part of the brain may play a role in the immune system. The findings are based on blood samples drawn from 12 women players. Their blood samples showed a rise in levels of white blood cells called T cells after they played bridge for 90 minutes. T cells are produced by the thymus gland  and used by the immune system against diseases. The T cells count jumped significantly in eight of the bridge players, and slightly in the other four.  The findings contribute to the field of neuroimmunology , whose name reflects the fact that the nervous system and the immune system are not considered separate and isolated systems. What isn't clear is whether the help to the immune system from an activity like contract bridge is lasting or temporary. It's also not clear whether the increase in T cells could finally be targeted against special illness. Diamond chose to study bridge players for the research because   _  .",

I just couldn't imagine why she had made her parents so angry. It seemed that Katie had been running up sizable charges in the lunchroom. Her parents explained that Katie brought a great homemade lunch each day, and there was no reason for her to buy school lunch. They assumed a sit-down with Katie would solve the problem, but failed. So they asked me to help them get to the bottom of this situation. So the next day, I asked Katie to my office. \"Why are you charging lunches, Katie? What happened to your homemade lunch?\" I asked. \"I lose it,\" she responded. I leaned back in my chair and said, \"I don't believe you, Katie. \" She didn't care. \"Is someone stealing your lunch, Katie?\" I took a new track. \"No. I just lose it,\" she said. Well, there was nothing else I could do. The problem was still unsolved the next week when I noticed a boy who was new to the school sitting alone at a lunch table. He always looked sad. I thought I would go and sit with him for a while. As I walked towards him, I noticed the lunch bag on the table. The name on the bag said \"Katie\". Now I understood and I talked to Katie. It seemed that the new boy never brought a lunch, and he wouldn't go to the lunch line for a free lunch. He had told Katie his secret and asked her not to tell anyone that his parents wanted him to get a free lunch at school. Katie asked me not to tell her parents, but I drove to her house that evening after I was sure that she was in bed. I had never seen parents so proud of their child. Katie didn't care that her parents and teacher were disappointed in her. But she cared about a little boy who was hungry and scared. Katie still buys lunch every day at school.

Sometimes I studied for weeks before a test. Yet I would go in to take the test, only to find I could not answer the questions correctly. I would blank out because of nervousness and fear. I couldn't think of the answer. My low grades on the tests did not show what I knew to the teacher. \"Another student in biology had similar experiences. He said, \"My first chemistry test was very difficult. Then, on the second test, I sat down to take it, and I was so nervous that I was shaking. My hands were moving up and down so quickly that it was hard to hold my pencil. I knew the material and I knew the answers. Yet I couldn't even write them down!\" These two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the extreme tension and nervousness. Contrary to people's common belief that poor grades are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety plays a role in students' achieving low grades. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students. Special university advising courses try to help students. In these courses, advisors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the tests show their anxiety is high, the students can take short courses to help them deal with their tensions. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. Students are trained to become calm in very tense situations. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease. Learned information then comes out without difficulty on a test. An expert at the University of California explains, \" With almost all students, relaxation and less stress are felt after taking our program.

      "question": "Some wonderfully creative uses of X-rays have been in the world of art.But the most impressive one is to uncover what has been covered up.Details unfolded by an X-ray of a painting can ' t be seen any other way.For example, in the past, paintings were often repaired if small pieces of paint fell off the canvas  . These repairs cannot be seen just by looking at the painting.It takes an X-ray to discover where the repairs have been made. An X-ray of a painting is one of the best ways to tell if it was created by a famous painter or if it is a forgery .If there is a question as to whether an old master has painted a certain painting or not, X-rays are made and compared to those of paintings that are known to be original.If the brushstrokes   , for example, are shown to be totally different than in other work done by a certain artist, then the painting is proved to be a fake copy. Since modern paints are usually made from different materials than paints of hundreds of years ago, the image they leave on an X-ray film looks different.This is another way X-rays can be used to spot a forgery.A modem artist will try to make a forgery look hundreds of years old by painting dirty varnish on it or by using artificial means to get the varnish to look cracked.To the naked eye the forgery may look old, but when a careful study of the X-ray image is made, the _ is obvious. It was common many years ago for an artist to finish a painting, decide it wasn't any good, and paint a completely different picture on top of it.Or artists would paint over others' work --it was their version of recycling.Taking an X-ray is the only way to find out if there is a picture underneath the picture you see with your eyes.Sometimes museums will be more interested in the painting beneath than the one on top, and will restore the older one by having the top layer painstakingly removed.

      "question": "As they migrate, butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops. What's the main idea of the text?",

      "question": "Blameless I was a freshman in college when I met the Whites. They were completely different from my own family, yet I felt at home with them immediately. Jane White and I became friends at school, and her family welcomed me like a long-lost cousin. In my family, it was always important to place blame when anything bad happened. \"Who did this? \"my mother would scream about a dirty kitchen. \"This is all your fault, Katharine, \"my father would insist when the cat got out or the dishwasher broke. From the time we were little, my sister, brothers and I told on each other. We set a place for blame at the dinner table. But the Whites didn't worry about who had done what. They picked up the pieces and moved on with their lives. The beauty of this was driven home to me the summer Jane died. In July, the White sisters and I decided to take a car trip from their home in Florida to New York. The two older sisters, Sarah and Jane, were college students, and the youngest, Amy, had recently turned sixteen. Proud of having a new driver's license ,Amy was excited about practicing her driving on the trip. She showed off her license to everyone she met. The big sisters shared the driving of Sarah's new car during the first part of the trip, but when they reached less crowded areas, they let Amy take over. Somewhere in South Carolina, we pulled off the highway to eat. After lunch, Amy got behind the wheel. She came to a crossroads with a stop sign. Whether she was nervous or just didn't see the sign no one would ever know, but Amy continued into the crossroads without stopping. The driver of a large truck, unable to stop in time, ran into our car. Jane was killed immediately. I was slightly injured. The most difficult thing that I've ever done was to call the Whites to tell them about the accident and that Jane had died. Painful as it was for me to lose a good friend, I knew that it was far worse for them to lose a child. When Mr. and Mrs. White arrived at the hospital, they found their two daughters sharing a room. Sarah had a few cuts on the head; Amy's leg was broken. They hugged us all and cried tears of sadness and of joy at seeing their daughters. They wiped away the girls' tears and made a few jokes at Amy as she learned to use her crutches . To both of their daughters, and especially to Amy, over and over they simply said, \"We're so glad that you're alive. \" I was astonished. No blame. No accusations. Later, I asked the Whites why they never talked about the fact that Amy was driving and had run a stop sign. Mrs. White said, \"Jane's gone, and we miss her terribly. Nothing we say or do will ever bring her back. But Amy has her whole life ahead of her. How can she lead a full and happy life if she feels we blame her for her sister's death? \" They were right.

Co-discoverer Andrew Warren is hoping to raise at least $50,000 by auctioning  off the rights to name the 4-inch \"owl eye\" butterfly, which lives in Sonora, a Mexican state bordering Arizona. \"That would support at least two years of research for our team down in Mexico,\" Warren said. \"Money goes a long way down here in Mexico.\" According to the scientific tradition, discoverers of a new species have the say in naming it. In recent years, some discoverers have auctioned off their naming rights to raise money. Warren said the amount being sought for the butterfly is not out of the question, noting that naming rights for a new monkey species brought in $650,000 two years ago. A group of 10 new fish species that went on the naming auction block at the same time earlier this year brought in a total of $2 million. The butterfly discovered by Warren and researcher George Austin ranges as far north as Mexico. The butterfly was actually in a collection, misidentified as an example of another new species, at the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity at the Florida Museum of National History in Gainesville, said Warren. They soon began the hard process of determining that it was indeed a \"new\" model of butterfly.

The people live in twenty-eight countries. Most of the countries are in Africa or the Middle East. P-A-I researcher Robert Engelman says by the year 2025, about three-thousand-million people may lack water. At least 18 more countries are expected to have severe water problems.

The report says lack of water in the future may result in several problems. It may increase health problems. Lack of water often means drinking waters not safe. Mr. Engelman says there are problems all over the world because of diseases, such as cholera, which are carried in water. Lack of water may also result in more international conflict. Countries may have to compete for water in the future. Some countries now get sixty percent of their fresh water from other countries. This is true of Egypt, the Netherlands, Cambodia, Syria, Sudan, and Iraq. And the report says lack of water would affect the ability of developing to improve their economies. This is because new industries often need a large amount of water when they are beginning. The Population Action International study gives several solutions to the water problem. One way, it says, is to find ways to use water for more than one purpose. Another way is to teach people to be careful not to waste water. A third way is to use less water of agriculture. The report also says long-term solutions to the water problem must include controls on population growth. It says countries cannot provide clean water unless they slow population growth by limiting the number of children people have. It can be inferred that   _  .",

      "question": "It was late, around 10 p.m. A young lady, named Thea, was waiting at the train station. She was waiting for the last train to arrive, when she heard her phone ring. It was her brother. The line was suddenly cut off when she answered, and the phone did not ring again. The lady waited for a call back, but her phone did not ring. She sat on the bench, holding her phone. She was definitely uneasy. Her mother was very ill and was in hospital. She was looking around, looking for a phone loading station, but since it was already late, the stalls were already closed. She had no choice but to wait till the train came and wait till she got home. A young lady in her late 20s approached her. She was very sincere. She asked what was wrong. Thea looked at the stranger's eyes and said \"nothing\". But the other lady was just so sincere and wanted to help.    She took out her cell phone from her shoulder bag and handed it to Thea. The helpful lady said, \"Here's my phone; it has extra loads; you can make a call.\" \"Is it OK? \" asked Thea. \"Yeah,\" she said, looking directly into her eyes. Then Thea, in a very shy manner, slowly dialed a number and talked with someone on the phone. A smile was on her face. \"Thank you so much; you took my worries away.\" \"You are welcome; I am glad that I can give you a hand. \" In fact, kindness can be shared at any time in any place.

      "question": "Heritage is our legacy   from the past, what we live with today, and what we pass on to future generations. Our cultural and natural heritage are both irreplaceable   sources of life and inspiration. Places as unique and diverse as the Pyramids of Egypt, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Great Wall of China make up our world's heritage. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world  considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. This is _ in an international treaty called the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972. How does a place become a World Heritage Site? It takes a lot of people to decide. 1)If a country wants one of its places to be on the World Heritage List, it has to ask UNESCO. The place must be important and special. UNESCO put the Great Wall on the list in 1987 because, it said, it was a great part of Chinese culture and beautifully made to go with the land. When a country asks, it must also make a plan for taking care of the place. 2)The World Heritage Committee of UNESCO talks about different places and decides whether to put them on the list. The committee meets every June. Many experts help the committee to decide. 3)After a new place goes on the list, UNESCO gives money to help keep it looking good. If a place is in serious danger, it may be put on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. UNESCO gives special care and help to those places. 4)Countries have to give UNESCO regular reports about places on the list.

It gives you a chance to slow down, to relax and to appreciate yourself and your life in general. It helps you slow down enough to breathe deeply, to calm your thoughts, and to research the natural world filled with wonders. And yes, to love yourself more. Try to spend one day for a long travel on foot--far from the requirements of work and family. First, choose a date and mark it as your \"relaxing day\". Next, choose a place that you want to visit on foot. If you enjoy being out in nature, head to a wide and open place. Try to choose a place that's no more than 15 minutes from your home. You want to spend your time walking, not driving. Walk at an easy speed so you can walk longer and farther. If you normally walk two miles a day, go for four to six miles. Wear comfortable clothes. If it's warm, wear a hat to protect your face. And don't forget your sunglasses-- not only to protect your eyes but also to give you a sense of privacy while you walk. Before you go out, get up early so you can spend a few minutes relaxing. Relaxing is something few people spend in their spare time, but it leaves you feeling much lighter and less annoyed.

If you really want to acquire a companion, think in advance whether you are able to handle it. Depending on what pet bird you are going to have and how big it is, the cost is different. For example, the cost of a comfortable cage, the cost for nutritional food and the money for some additional things should be taken into consideration. There are also some unexpected cost. For example, when your pet bird gets sick, you have to send for a vet  . You may think that you do not have free time to have a dog so you'd better have a pet bird because it doesn't require a lot of attention. You are wrong! Some people even do not have time for a short sleep. They will not have enough time for pets, either. For good bird health it is very important to handle them and play with them as much as you can. Also there are a lot of people who think that birds do not require a lot of space and they are wrong again. They also need to fly so if you do not have space for it, you'd better reconsider the things.  But do not forget the great advantage of having a pet bird. In the animal kingdom, birds rank near the top when it comes to smarts. You can have a friend for life if you take good care of it. It's a real character and can bring joy and colour in your home.

      "question": "A few years ago it was popular to speak of a generation gap, a disagreement between young people and their elders.Parents said that children did not show them proper respect and obedience , while children complained that their parents did not understand them at all.What had gone wrong? Why had the generation gap suddenly appeared? Actually the generation gap has been _ for a long time.Many people argue that a gap is built into the fabric of our society. One important cause of the generation gap is the chance that young people have to choose their own ways of life.In more traditional societies, when children grow up, they are expected to live in the same area as their parents, to marry people that their parents know and agree to, and to continue the family occupation .In our society, young people often travel great distances for their education, move out of the family home at an early age, marry or live with people whom their parents have never met, and choose occupations different from those of their parents. In our easily changing society, parents often expect their children to do better than they did: to find better jobs, to make more money, and to do all the things that they were unable to do.Often, however, the strong desire that parents have for their children are another cause of the disagreement between them.Often, they discover that they have very little in common with each other. Finally, the speed at which changes take place in our society is another cause of the gap between the generations.In a traditional culture, elderly people are valued for their wisdom, but in our society the knowledge of a lifetime may become out of date overnight.The young and the old seem to live in two very different worlds, separated by different skills and abilities. No doubt, the generation gap will continue to be a feature of American life for some time to come.Its causes are rooted in the freedom and changes of our society, and in the rapid speed at which society changes.

But will sleeping more on the weekend make up for hours of lost snoozing  ? One sleep expert, W. Christopher Winter raised the question. Sleeping binge Getting eight hours of shut-eye each night is generally recommended, but many people don't. As the week rolls from Monday to Friday, they accumulate a sleep debt. Spending a few extra hours in bed on a Saturday morning, people assume, will help them \" catch up\" on lost sleep. They're likely right, \" Nobody knows how long the horizon is, probably a few nights, but studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work,\" says Dr. Winter, a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Sleep banking Recent data suggests that banking sleep in advance of a long night can actually offset   upcoming sleep deprivation . If you knew you were going to have to stay up all night on a particular day, for example, you could sleep for 10 hours a day for multiple days before the event, and be fine, Dr. Winter says. Just plan ahead. Routine  naps A scheduled nap is healthier than catching up on or banking sleep. \" Because sleep extension can make you feel groggy  , I always recommend a short nap [if a person feels they need it ], at the same time, every day,\" says Dr. Winter. He adds that 25 minutes is ideal. \" When you schedule a short nap, your body anticipates it and slows down, without falling into a deep dream sleep,\" he says. That refreshing, scheduled break is better than an occasional weekend lie-in. \" The body likes routine,\" he says, \" When it's prepared, it works more efficiently.\" What would be the best title for the passage?",

His mother's ancestors were early settlers in Texas, and over the generations had acquired a 25,000 acre farm at Cotulla. Jeffrey spent most summers of his youth working with his grandfather on their farm. Jeffrey showed intense and varied scientific interests at an early age. He set up an electric alarm to keep his younger sisters and brothers out of his room and changed his parents' garage into a laboratory for his science projects. After he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering, Jeffrey Bezos found employment on Wall Street, where computer science was increasingly in demand to study market trends. He rose quickly, becoming a senior vice president, and looked forward to a bright career in finance, when he made a discovery that changed his life, and the course of business history. In 1994, there was still no Internet commerce to speak of. One day that spring, Jeffrey Bezos observed that Internet usage was increasing by 2,300 percent a year. He saw an opportunity for a new circle of commerce, and immediately began considering the possibilities. Bezos founded Amazon. com in 1994, setting up the original company in his garage. The company was called Amazon for the seemingly endless South American river with its numberless branches. It started as an online bookstore but soon diversified to all kinds of products. His work with Amazon eventually led him to become one of the most excellent dot-com entrepreneurs. He was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 1999. In 2008, he was selected by U. S. News & World Report as one of America's Best Leaders. Bezos's Amazon has become  \"the Earth's biggest anything store\".

We certainly act as if they don't.Most chefs cook lobsters and crabs alive, usually by dumping them in boiling water.Along with melted butter.That's the appeal of crustaceans-there's no fresher food.We may feel a bit of guilt, or maybe just discomfort, when we hear the creatures rattling   around the inside of the pot as the water boils.But that feeling usually  _ for lobster lovers by the time we crack open a claw and dig out the delicious meat.We wouldn't dream of doing the same thing to a live chicken or pig which are dead well before die cooking process begins, but those crustaceans are different.They don't even feel pain.Right? Actually, they just might.That's the conclusion of a new study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.Robert Elwood and Barry Magee of Queen's University in Belfast examined the reaction of common shore crabs to small electrical shocks. Ninety crabs were placed in a brightly lit area and were given the choice of moving to one of two dark shelters.(Shore crabs like to hide in dark, tight spaces.) Once they'd made their choice, the crabs in one of the shelters were exposed to an electric shock.After a rest period, the crabs were returned to the lit tank.Most of the crabs went back into the dark shelters, and then the same crabs were given another electric shock.When they were placed back into the lit tank for the third time, the majority of the shocked crabs instead went to the other dark shelter, avoiding the one where they had repeatedly been shocked. As Elwood put it, the crabs' choice indicated they wanted to escape the shocks: Having experienced two rounds of shocks, the crabs learned to avoid the shelter where they received the shock. They were willing to give up their hideaway in order to avoid the source of their probable pain. According to the author, people cook the crab alive due to the belief that  _  .",

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates delivered the commencement   address at Harvard University on Thursday, and was awarded the L. L. D. honorary doctorate  . \"Our speaker is known as the most influential entrepreneur  of the personal computer revolution. He was named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004, 2005, 2006 and again in 2007, \" said Harvard's president, Derek Bok. Then Bok spoke more directly to Gates: \"Just think what you could have achieved if you had stayed another two years.\" Gates told the students, many of whom will soon be launching into full-time careers, that work isn't the only thing of importance. \"Judge yourself not on the professional accomplishments but on how well you have addressed the world's inequities, how you have treated people who have nothing to do with you,\" he said. In recent months, Gates has been giving a larger part of his time and energy to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which focuses on issues including global health and education. In 2008, he plans to make the foundation his chief responsibility. But for the most part, the Microsoft co-founder stuck to the serious message about trying to make the world a better place. He urged the graduates not to get discouraged about seemingly intractable   challenges of poverty and poor health. As many as 30,000 people were expected to attend the outdoor commencement ceremony. Gates wasn't the only high-profile speaker on the prefix = st1 /Cambridgecampus this week. On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton delivered Harvard's Class Day speech.

      "question": "Let's do some sleep math.You lost two hours of sleep every night last week because of a big project due on Friday.On Saturday and Sunday,you slept in,getting four extra hours.On Monday morning, you were feeling so bright-eyed that you only had one cup of coffee, instead of your usual two.But don't be cheated by your energy.You're still carrying around a heavy load of sleepiness, or what experts call\"sleep debt\"----in this case something like six hours,almost a full nights' sleep. Sleep debt is the difference between the amount of sleep you should be getting and the amount you actually get.It's a deficit that grows every time we skim some extra minutes off our nightly sleep.\"People accumulate sleep debt gradually without being noticed,\"says William C.Dement,founder of the Stanford University Sleep Clinic.Studies show that such short--term sleep deprivation leads to a foggy brain,worsened vision,and trouble remembering. Long-term effects include obesity,insulin resistance, and heart disease. A survey by the National Sleep Foundation reports that we're losing one hour of sleep each night----more than two full weeks of sleep every year. The good news is that,like all debt, with some work,sleep debt can be repaid. Adding an extra hour or two of sleep a night is the way to catch up.For the long--term lack of sleep,take it easy for a few months to get back into a natural sleep pattern. Go to bed when you are tired,and allow your body to wake you in the morning(no alarm clock allowed).You may find yourself catatonic in the beginning of the recovery cycle:expect to have ten hours shut-eye per night. As the days pass, however,the amount of sleeping time will gradually decrease. So earn back that lost sleep----and follow the dictates of your innate sleep needs. You'll feel better.\"When you put away sleep debt, you become a superman,\"says Stanford's Dement, talking about the improved mental and physical capabilities that come with being well rested.

Sparky never asked a classmate to go out in high school. He was too afraid of being refused. However, one thing was important to Sparky - drawing. He was proud of his artwork. Of course, no one else appreciated it. In his senior year of high school, he sent some cartoons to the editors of the Yearbook. Although the cartoons were turned down, Sparky was so confident about his ability that he decided to become an artist. After completing high school, he wrote a letter to Walt Disney Studios. He was told to send some samples of his artwork, and the subject for a cartoon was suggested. Sparky spent a great deal of time on it. Finally, the reply came from Disney Studios. He had been rejected once again. Another loss for the loser. So Sparky decided to write his own autobiography in cartoons. He described his childhood - a little boy loser and underachiever.

For those who know Ponso's backstory,his immediate ease and trust in humans might be surprising.Ponso was one of 20 chimps,all between the ages of 7 to 11 years old,relocated to an island off the Ivory Coast after being used for testing by the New York Blood Centre.After the tests were completed in 2005,the lab reportedly transferred the chimps to a string of islands,occasionally dropping off food and water because there was none in the chimps' new homes. Disease and hunger soon left only Ponso,his mate and their two children standing.But at the end of 2013 they died within days of each other and Ponso was now completely alone.

      "question": "Sports is not only physically challenging, but it can also mentally challenging. Criticism from coaches(trainers), parents, and other teammates, as well as pressure to win can create too much anxiety or stress for young athletes. Stress can be physical, emotional, or psychological, and research has showed that it can lead to burnout. Burnout has been described as dropping or quitting of an activity that was at one time enjoyable. The early years of development are critical years for learning about oneself. The sport setting is one where valuable experiences can take place. Young athletes can, for example, learn how to cooperate with others, make friends, and gain other social skills that will be used throughout their lives. Coaches and parents should be aware(realize), at all times, that their feedback to youngsters can greatly affect their children. Youngsters may take their parents' and coaches' criticisms to heart and find a flaw  in themselves. Coaches and parents should also be cautious(careful) that youth sport participation does not become work for children. The outcome of the game should not be more important than the process of learning the sport and other life lessons. In today's youth sport setting, young athletes may be worrying more about who will win instead of enjoying themselves and the sport. Following a game, many parents and coaches focus on(pay more attention to) the outcome and find fault with youngsters' performances. Positive reinforcement should be provided in spite of the outcome.

Perhaps your family and friends said similar things to you when you left home. But does it seem true all the time? Is your life in this new country always wonderful and exciting? A great many facts show that it's not easy for newcomers to adjust to life in a new culture. They have to experience culture shock. What causes culture shock? Maybe the weather is unpleasant. Perhaps the customs are different. Perhaps the public service systems such as the telephone, post office, or transportation are difficult to figure out and you make mistakes. The simplest things seem difficult. The language may be difficult. The food may seem strange to you. If you don't look similar to the natives, you may feel strange. You may feel as if everyone is watching you. In fact, you are always watching yourself. Everyone experiences culture shock in some form or another. But culture shock comes as a surprise to most people. A lot of the time, the people with the worst culture shock are the people who never had any difficulties in their own countries. They were active and successful in their community. They had hobbies or pastimes which they enjoyed. When they come to a new country, they do not have the same positions or hobbies as they already had in their countries. They find themselves without a role, almost without an identity. They have to build a new self-image. Culture shock produces a feeling of disorientation , which may be homesickness, imagined illness, or even paranoia . When people feel the disorientation of culture shock, they sometimes feel like staying inside all the time. They want to protect themselves from the unfamiliar environment. They want to create an escape within their room to give themselves a sense of security. This escape does solve the problem of culture shock for the short term, but it does nothing to familiarize the person more with the culture.

Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. With his first wife and two children he left Vermont by covered wagon in 1855 to homestead in Kansas. Perhaps he did not find farming to his liking, or perhaps he was lured  by rumors of fortunes to be made in Colorado mines. At any rate, a few years later he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\" he said. As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco.It was his custom to \"grubstake\" prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or \"grub\", while they looked for ore , in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value. Finally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \"grub\". Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took $17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \"Pittsburgh Mine,\" made $1,300,000 for Tabor in return for his $17 investment. Later Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for $117,000. This turned out to be even more unbelievable than the Pittsburgh, yielding $35,000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew. Tabor became its first mayor, and later became lieutenant  governor of the state. The underlying reason for Tabor's life career is   _  .",

      "question": "When companies do business overseas, they come in contact with people from different cultures.These individuals often speak a different language and have their own particular custom and manners.These differences can create problems.        For example, in France, business meetings begin promptly   at the designated time and everyone is expected to be there.Foreign business people who are late are often left outside to cool their heels as a means of letting them know the importance of promptness.Unless one is aware of such expected behaviors, he may end up insulting the people with whom he hopes to establish trade relations.        A second traditional problem is that of monetary conversions .For example, if a business deal is conducted with Russia, payment may be made in rubles.Of course, this currency is of little value to the American firm.It is, therefore, necessary to convert the foreign currency to American dollars.How much are these Russian rubles worth in terms of dollars? This conversion rate is determined by every market, where the currencies of countries are bought and sold.Thus there is an established rate.although it will often change from day to day.For example, the ruble may be worth 0.75 on Monday and 0.72 on Tuesday because of an announced wheat shortage in Russia.In addition, there is the dilemma associated with converting at 0.72.Some financial institutions may be unwilling to pay this price, feeling that the ruble will sink much lower over the next week.As a result, conversion may finally come at 0.69.These \"losses\" must be accepted by the company as one of the costs of doing business overseas.        A third unique problem is trade barriers.For one reason or another, all countries impose trade barriers on certain goods crossing their borders.Some trade barriers are directly related to exports.For example, the United States permits strategic military material to be shipped abroad only after government permission has been obtained.Most trade barriers, however, are designed to restrict import.Two of the most common import barriers are quotas   and tariffs  .

      "question": "Everybody hates rats. But in the earthquake places of the world - Japan, Los Angeles, Turkey - rats will soon be man's new best friends. What happens after an earthquake? We send in rescue  dogs. Why? Because they can smell people. Dogs save lives. They help rescuers to find living people. But dogs are big and they can't get into small spaces. So now a new research project is using a smaller animal to save lives: the rat. How does it work? First, the rat is trained to smell people. When this happens, the rat's brain gives a signal. This is sent to a small radio on its back, and then the rescuers follow the radio signals. When the rat's brain activity jumps, the rescuers know that someone is alive. The rat has smelled that person. Although there are already robots which can do this job, rats are better. Christian Linster at Cornell University, New York, says, \" 'Robot' noses don't work well when there are other smells around. Rats are good at that.\" Rats can also see in the dark. They are cheaper and quicker to train than dogs, and unlike robots, they don't need electricity. The \" rat project\" is not finished, but Julie Ryan of International Rescue Corps in Scotland says, \" It would be fantastic. A rat would get into spaces we couldn't get to and a rat would get out if it wasn't safe.\" Perhaps for the first time in history, people will be happy to see a rat in a building ( but only after an earthquake, of course.)

      "question": "The Elysee Palace in France enjoys equal popularity in the world with the Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom, the Kremlin in Russia as well as the White House in the U. S. It is the residence of the president of the French Republic and the symbol of the supreme authority in France. The Elysee palace, with an area of 11,000 square metres, is at the eastern end of the Champs Elysee in the city of Paris proper and backed by a large and peaceful garden of more than twenty thousand square metres. Its main building, quite handsome and graceful, is a two-story classical stone architecture of European style, and beside it are two side buildings facing each other and with an extensive rectangular courtyard in the middle. There are altogether 369 halls and rooms of different sizes. The Elysee Palace, built in 1718, has a ling history of close to300 years to date. This house was at first a private residence of a count named d'Evreau, so it was called Hotel d'Evreau. It had later gone through many changes and its owners had been changed for many times, but all the residents in it were distinguished persons and high officials. The house was renamed Bonaparte Mansion when it was owned by Louis X V and Louis X VI successively when they acted as emperors. Napoleon I signed his act of abdication here when he had suffered defeat in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Nopoleon III moved in the   Mansion in 1848 when he was elected president, and the house became a Royal Palace when he declared himself as emperor. The Third French Republic issued a decree in 1873, appointing officially the Elysee Palace as the residence president of the French Republic. Over the hundred years since then, almost all the president of the French Republic worked and lived there. Starting from 1989, the Elysee Palace is open to the public every year in September on the French Castles Day. What's the purpose of the passage?",

      "question": "Are you reading this while sitting in an office cubicle ? If so, please take a moment and glance around you. Are there photos of your last vacation hung on the wall? One of your kid's drawings? A yellowed print of a favorite cartoon? If so, you are doing something good for both yourself and your organization. Newly published research suggests working in an environment that offers little privacy can lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout . But personalizing one's workplace is an effective protection against such unwanted outcomes. \"Individuals may take comfort from the items with which they surround themselves at work, and these items may help employees to keep emotional energy high in the face of stresses that come from their work,\" writes a research team led by Gregory Laurence of the University of Michigan-Flint, Michigan, in north central U.S. In the Journal of Environmental Psychology, Laurence and his colleagues describe a study featuring 87 white-collar employees at a large, urban university in the Midwestern United States. Research assistants noted whether they worked in a private office (with a door that can be closed) or a cubicle. They also counted the number of items each worker had brought from home to decorate his or her workspace - a list that included photographs, posters, artworks. Not surprisingly, Laurence and his colleagues found a connection between the amount of privacy an employee enjoys and his or her rate of burnout. \"High privacy conditions tend to serve as strong protectors against unwelcome interferences and distractions ,\" they noted, \"contributing to a work environment supporting reduced emotional exhaustion.\" But this link disappeared when those employees had personalized their cubicles. Employees who had turned their workspaces into areas that reflect their interests and personalities reported the same (relatively low) level of emotional exhaustion, no matter whether they worked in an office or a cubicle. The research confirms \"the calming effect\" of having your own stuff around you. So if you're feeling exhausted at work, relief could be as simple as hanging a few of your kindergartener's colorful creations on your cubicle wall. Where does this passage probably come from?",

Tommy, a seven-year-old dog, belonged to Maria Lochi, 57, and had been her faithful partner after she adopted him when she found him in fields close to her home. Mrs. Lochi adopted several dogs she found but friends said she developed a close friendship with Tommy and would walk to church with him every day, where he would be allowed to sit patiently by her feet. Father Panna said, \"He's there every time I celebrate Mass and is very well behaved. He doesn't make a sound, and I've not heard one bark from him in all the time he has been in. He used to come with Maria and he was obviously devoted to her. I let him stay inside as he was always so well behaved and none of the other people ever complained to me. He's still coming to Mass even after Maria's funeral, he just sat there quietly. I didn't have the heart to throw him out. I've just recently lost my own dog so I leave him there until Mass finishes and then I let him out.\" Tommy's been adopted by everyone in the village now and he is everybody's friend.

      "question": "Walt Disney is credited for creating such wonderful things as Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. However, he cannot take the credit for creating other well-loved characters, such as Cinderella and Snow White. _ are almost automatically associated with Disney because Disney turned old fables  into cartoon movies. The original Cinderella varies very much from the Disney version we know today. It started off with the girl mourning her mother's death and going to her tomb three times a day. In addition, there were only birds that helped Cinderella; there was no such thing as a fairy godmother or helpful mice, nor was there mention of a horse and carriage. The stepsisters were cruel: they always threw Cinderella's food into the ashes of the fire and made her sleep on the ashes on the floor, hence her name. In the original story, the king's ball actually lasted for three days. With the help of the birds, the girl, beautifully dressed, danced with the prince on all three nights and the prince fell in love with her. However, she broke away from him to rush back home each night. On the last night, the prince placed soothing sticky on the stairs; as Cinderella made her escape, a shoe got stuck on it. Here now is where the story becomes unpleasant: when the prince went to the house looking for the girl whose foot fit the shoe, the wicked  stepmother told one of her two daughters to cut off her big toe to fit into the shoe. The daughter did as told. So the prince took her away to be his bride. But when they passed the tomb of Cinderella's mother, the birds called out to the prince, \"Turn and peep, there's blood in the shoe; the shoe is too small, the true bride waits for you.\" ZXXK Realizing he had been tricked, the prince returned the daughter to her mother. The other then had to cut off part of her heel in order to fit into the shoe, with the same result. Only Cinderella's foot fit perfectly and so the prince chose to marry her. The story ends with the wedding day: as Cinderella's two stepsisters followed her, pretending to be devoted to her so that they could enjoy the king's riches, two birds flew by and plucked  out their eyes. Because of their wickedness and falsehood, they had to spend the rest of their days blind. The original Cinderella is so different from the Disney version. Thank goodness Disney made such changes; it indeed was a wise move. What does the author think of the Disney version?",

By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified  as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes.  Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \"We're waking up,\" he says. \"But not fast enough.\"  In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate  their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a $1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further.  Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days.  City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it.

Did you know that a small today used to be a medium, 20 years ago? A recent research shows 97%of teens need more exercise. It's bad news because too little exercise means you are missing a lot of good things in life. Exercise helps in two ways. First,exercise helps your body. Physical activity can make your body strong. It can also keep you at a healthy weight. Doctors say that people who stay at a healthy weight have fewer health problems. Second,exercise can help your mind. People who get plenty of physical activity might worry less and sleep better at night. You may even learn better in school. Students who are healthy can listen and understand better in class. So you can change your life and be more active at any point. It's never too late. An article called  \"How to Limit Screen Time and Get Moving\"gives these ideas: Step away from the screen. Doctors call watching TV or playing video games screen time. You should have no more than two hours of screen time a day. You will enjoy life more if you live it instead of watching it! Start slowly. An hour a day can seem like a long time. Start with 10 minutes of new activities every day. Add more as you get stronger. Think about walking. Take the stairs instead of the lift. You will feel healthier. Make fitness fun. Find a sport you like. It doesn't need to be the traditional sports of basketball, soccer,or baseball. Those are all great sports and if you like them, play them. However,you can also try hiking,skateboarding,or even rope jumping. If you enjoy the sport,you will do it. Choose food carefully. Help your family shop for healthy food. Read the labels .Look for healthy foods. Eat lots of fiuits and vegetables. Stop buying soft drinks and junk foods. You will feel better if you eat right.

DNA is something that everybody has, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our mother and father, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Gregor Mendel discovered a special reason why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things named \"genes\" in our body. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick made another discovery and found out that those small parts are real messages written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Johann Matthaci found a message in DNA showing how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. Scientists have now found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \"word\"   means, we can help save more people from several illnesses. Most people hope that this will help make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when people begin to know more words and find out lots of other information, we might use it in a wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people from getting jobs.

The Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space says more than 1,300 fires are burning across the country. The government has sent about 25,000 soldiers, police and firefighters in six provinces to battle the fires. Indonesian farmers and some businesses often burn rainforest to clear land at this time of year. The burning usually takes place during the country's dry season. But a large rise in palm oil production on peat lands is blamed for the many fires this year. Peat is made partly of dead plants, which burns easily and is often used as cooking fuel. The resulting thick, black smoke has polluted skies over Indonesia and four other countries. The burning has worsened air quality, closed schools and caused any outdoor activities to stop. The smoke is not only affecting people; it is affecting wildlife. In Indonesian Borneo, an animal rescue center says some of its animals have developed breathing problems. If the fires continue, a lot more could become sick and some could die. Scientists have warned that the fires this year could be worst ever because of a weather system called El Nino.

He sold little,and he could see that he was going to lose money. One night,Mr.Jones sat bay the fire and was worried after another very bad day. Suddenly he got an idea. He found a piece of wood and wrote to the following notice on it in big letters: \"WHAT DO YOU THINK I GIVE AWAY PENCILS AND PAPER AND INK\" He put up the notice in front of the shop window before he went to bed. He slept better than usual that night. The following day, many people came to the shop. Mr. Jones said good morning to them all with a bright smile and asked the frist woman what she wanted. She chose some writing paper and a pencil. As soon as he put them on her hands, she turned to leave the shop. \"That will be thirty cents ,please,\" he said. \"Why?\" she asked in surprise. \"That's the price of the paper and the pencil.\" \"But your notice says it's free,\" she replied. \"Oh no,\" he said, \"how can I make any money if everything is free?\" She took him outside and showed him the notice \"It is wrong,too,\"she said. \"where is the question mark after the word 'think'?\" \"There isn't a question mark,\"he said. \"But there should be one .\" \"I'm afraid you've made a mistake,\" Mr.Jones said.\"You have read my notice in the wrong way.\" \"Not at all,\" said the woman. \"It is quite easy to read. It says: What do you think? I give away pencils and paper and ink!\" \"No,\" Mr.Jones said. \"You should read it like this: _ And the answer to the question is: Certainly not!

      "question": "Several years ago, the mayor of Chicago, Illinois, visited Germany, a leader in green roof design. Later he decided to have vegetation planted on Chicago City Hall. Today, the tops of many other buildings also look like parks. In Canada, the Coast Plaza Hotel in Vancouver has a forest on its roof. New York City has an unusual example farm for hydroponics. The farm is on a boat called the Science Barge. Rainwater and river water are used to grow lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. The farm shows the possibilities for designing rooftop systems. Green roofs are designed to save energy and capture rainwater. Rooftops covered with plants help keep buildings cool. They can extend the life of a roof. And they can reduce water running off into streets and storming water systems. Experts say green roofs usually do not get much above 27degC. So temperatures might not be a problem for growing. But rooftop gardeners have to be careful not to put too much weight on the roof. This is true whether plants are grown in soil or water. Earlier in 2008, researchers in Texas reported that green roofs can reduce a building's air conditioning costs by about onefifth compared to blacktop roofs.  But they also reported that not all green roofs perform equally well. They found that designs differ in their ability to keep buildings cool and to capture rainwater. The researchers put experimental roofs on top of metal insulated   boxes, to recreate green roof conditions. The study compared products from six companies to help businesses understand how to improve their designs. Each rooftop had sixteen different kinds of plants native to Texas. The researchers say the presence of native plants likely helped all the green roofs capture water better compared to sedums. Sedums are plants that need little water and often are used on green roofs. The native plants could take in more water and release more of it to the atmosphere.

Bose has a large circle of friends, and there's one who you may have heard of: President Obama. He has twice publicly recognized her achievements in cancer research and spoken with her in the Oval Office. If that isn't enough, Bose recently gave a TED Talk about her work with the cancer drug Cisplatin, which also won her first prize at the Google Science Fair and recognition as one of Glamour magazine's Young Amazing Women of the Year. After watching her grandfather struggle with liver cancer, Bose was determined to help out in any way she could. As a high school student though, her scientific choices were limited. She reached out to various hospitals and research centers, but doctors turned down her requests because they felt she was too inexperienced medically. Only the North Texas Science Health Center respected her determination and chose to guide her. The results were amazing. Bose chose to study a protein   and its reaction with the cancer drug Cisplatin. She noticed that when she prevented this protein from growing, Cisplatin was allowed to begin destroying cancer cells once again. \"My project not only contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the protein and Cisplatin, but also suggests a newer, more effective treatment for patients who resist Cisplatin,\" Bose said. Bose's achievements aren't limited to the lab, though. She was also captain of her swim team and editor-in-chief of her school paper.

      "question": "It seems that great artists and scientists often suffer from mental problems. Both Einstein and Dickens had mental illness. Now scientists have started to look at whether mental illness and genius are linked . Dr. Adele Juda studied 5,000 creative people in Germany. She found there were more people with mental illness in this group than in the general population. Poets had the highest rate  of mental illness, followed by musicians, with lower numbers for painters and architects. Other scientists did research which also showed a strong link between mental problems and creativity. But, it did nothing to explain it. Dr. Ruth Richards of Harvard University _ . Instead of studying creative people, she took a group of psychiatric  patients and tested them for creativity. The patients got much higher scores than a normal group. Also, the patients' close relatives were much more creative than the patients and a normal group. This suggests that the key to the link between creativity and mental illness is in our genes . But this is a problem. According to Darwinism, harmful genes should be removed. Some scientists believe that evolution  has created a balance, where the madness of a few people leads to the development of the whole human race. Geniuses may be mad, bad or just difficult to understand, but their discoveries have improved the world we live in. It seems that a little creative madness is good for us all.

We were busy through those hot summer months, driving between visits. Our work was strictly done at the pet owner's home. It was almost too busy for the two of us, but we were making good money! We asked pet owners new to our business to phone two weeks ahead so we had enough time to meet the owners and pets at their homes and make any following meetings before the owner leaves. One day, we decided to take on a new customer just two days before they would leave. We met the family, filled in a form, and spent some time with their dog, Hercules. He playfully jumped on us and touched our hands and arms using his tongue. The family laughed as he did this, showing us that he was very loving. Two days later I appeared at the house, alone. I came up to Hercules and said hello happily. I filled up his water bowl and cleaned any messes he made. Meanwhile, he was so lovely sitting beside. I thought this would be the good picture to send to the owners as usual. After the light and \"click\" sound went off, Hercules rushed at me. I didn't know what had just happened until I noticed the drops of blood. I ran out and did the only thing--calling my husband. Then I went to neighbors for help. My husband arrived after ten minutes.

      "question": "Nowadays more and more young athletes are taking part in the risky activities called \"extreme sports\" or \"X-sports\". In the past young athletes would play baseball. Today, they want risk and excitement -- the closer to the edge, the better. They snowboard over cliff and hike deep mountains. Extreme sports started as an alternative to more expensive sports such as golf. A city kid who couldn't afford expensive sports equipment could get a skateboard and have fun. But now it has become a whole new area of sports, with specialized equipment and high levels of skill. There is even an Olympics for extreme sports, called the winter x-game, which includes snow mountain hiking and ice climbing. What makes extreme sports so popular? Maybe it's because people love the risk. City people want to be outdoors on the weekends and do something challenging. The new equipment is so much better that people can take more risks without getting hurt. Sure there's a risk. Once you go mountain hiking or snowboarding, it's impossible to go back to have riding or skiing. It's just too boring. Now even the older crowd is starting to join in. Every weekend, groups of friends in their early 30s get together. On weekdays they work as computer programmers in the same office. On weekends they hike mountains together.

      "question": "Look at the keyboard of any standard typewriter or computer.\"Q,\"\"W,\"\"E,\"\"R\"\"T\"and\"Y\"are the first six letters.Who decided on this arrangement of the letters? And why? People tried for centuries to invent the typewriter.In 1714 in England,Henry Mill filed a patent for a machine called An Artificial Machine Or Method for the Impressing or Transcribing of Letters,Singly or Progressively one after another, as in Writing,whereby all Writing whatsoever may be Engrossed in Paper or Parchment so Neat and Exact as not to be distinguished from Print.That machine probably didn't sell because no one could remember its name! The first practical typewriter was patented in the United States in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes.His machine was known as the type-writer.It had a movable carriage,a lever for turning paper from line to line,and a keyboard on which the letters were arranged in alphabetical order. But Sholes had a problem.On his first model,his\"ABC\"key arrangement caused the keys to jam when the typist worked quickly.Sholes didn't know how to keep the keys from sticking,so his solution was to keep the typist from typing too fast.Sholes asked his brother-in-1aw to rearrange the keyboard so that the commonest letters were not so close together and the type bars would come from opposite directions.Thus they would not clash together and jam the machine.The new arrangement was the QWERTY arrangement typists use today.Of course,Sholes claimed that the new arrangement was scientific and would add speed and efficiency.The only efficiency it added was to slow the typist down,since almost any word in the English language required the typist's fingers to cover more distance on the keyboard. The advantages of the typewriter outweighed the disadvantages of the keyboard.Typists memorized the crazy letter arrangement,and the typewriter became a huge success.By the time typists had memorized the new arrangement of letters and built their speed,typewriter technology had improved,and the keys didn't stick as badly as they had at first.

But without pain, everyday activities can be hazardous for Ashlyn. In fact, they could kill her. When Ashlyn was born, no one knew that she couldn't feel pain. But soon there was hints that something was wrong. When Ashlyn's teeth grew in, she almost chewed off part on her tongue. Ashlyn's parents took her to doctor for tests. The doctors discovered that Ashlyn couldn't feel pain, a condition called congenital insensitivity to pain(CIPA). Fewer than 100 people in the United States have it. There is no cure. . \"Sometimes it's frustrating,\" she admits. But Ashlyn doesn't let anything stop her from doing things she wants to do. \"I just have to be careful,\" she says. For years, Ashlyn didn't know anyone else who had CIPA. That made it harder to deal with her condition. \"I felt alone,\" she says. One night she dreamed that there was a camp for kids like her.

      "question": "Almost every child is scared of something, from monsters in the cupboard to dogs in the park. But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias  much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological  . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\"scaredy cat\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'.\" If we fail to help children to overcome fears, they will  _  .",

      "question": "The children's Theater was actually an old mill building with cement walls, twisting passages and big staircases. One afternoon, my eight-year-old sister Brittany and I were with the drama group rehearsing A Little Princess, a children's play. \"Good luck!\" I whispered as Brittany adjusted her boarding school costume.   \"Take your places for act one, please. Everyone, places for act one!\" called the director. The lights went out and the rehearsal began. Halfway through the first act, Brittany finished her part and went backstage. She grabbed her script from the table and read along with the rehearsal that was still going on in front of the curtain. A small group of fellow actors joined her, and started practicing lines. Suddenly, something wet exploded on the back of Brittany's head! Turning around, she saw a tall girl with a beverage bottle in her hand. Sticky blue liquid slid down Brittany's face. The older girl laughed . Brittany glanced at her, expecting someone else to speak up and defend her. However, they all screamed with laughter and pointed mocking fingers at Brittany, who ran out of the make-up room in dismay.   Ten minutes later, Brittany met me backstage. \"A big girl just sprayed me with this stuff and laughed at me,\" she said, trying to wipe the liquid out of her curly hair. \"All the other girls laughed, too.\" I didn't even know the girl's name, and she was bullying my sister ! When we got home, we looked at the cast list and found that the girl's name was Jessica. Our mom e-mailed the director, who said she would talk to Jessica and arrange time for an apology right before the next rehearsal. Nobody really expected a heartfelt apology from Jessica but Brittany was prepared to forgive her. Before the next rehearsal, the director met Brittany at the door and announced that we had a problem on our hands. \"Jessica swears that she was never even near you yesterday,\" she said. But Brittany knew the truth. As she glanced across the room full of young actors, she glimpsed Jessica sitting in a metal folding chair. For a split second, their eyes met. Jessica quickly turned away to stare in the opposite direction. For weeks afterwards, no matter how hard Brittany tried to talk to her, Jessica refused to look her way. It was very difficult for Brittany to work with Jessica during every rehearsal , for three hours each week. But finally, we were ready to perform. There would be three performances over the course of the next weekend. Brittany and I were glad that the ordeal was almost over. After the first show, Brittany and I each got a beautiful bouquet from our church's pastor and his wife. Jessica didn't get a single flower. The second night, we received flowers from our grandparents. Again, Jessica received nothing. On the way home, Brittany spoke up. \"Mommy\", she said quietly from the back seat of the car, \"I've been thinking, and I decided to buy some flowers for Jessica,\" Mom smiled in surprise and replied, \"That would be very nice.\" Before the last performance, Brittany met Jessica on the way to the theater. She handed the older girl a big bunch of yellow roses, bought with her own savings. \"Great job with the show last night, Jessica. These are for you.\" Jessica was astonished. \"For me?\" she said. \"These flowers are for me? Are you sure?\" \"Yes I want you to have them!\" Brittany skipped towards the dressing room, leaving Jessica staring at her with a confused look on her face and a bouquet of beautiful flowers in her arms.  That night, Jessica finally received some flowers from her dad. She pulled out a spring of carnations and smiled shyly as she gave them to Brittany. Maybe Jessica will never apologize to Brittany. Maybe she won't ever even admit her mistake. But she is just beginning to realize what wonderful things a person's love does in people like Brittany. What would be the best title for the passage ?",

      "question": "One day Mr. White gave his wife ten pounds for her birthday -- ten new pound notes. So Mrs. White went out shopping. She waited for a bus, got on it and sat down next to an o1d 1ady. After a while, Mrs. White noticed that the old 1ady's handbag was open. Inside it, she saw a wad of pound notes exactly like the ones her husband had given her. So she quickly looked into her own bag -- the notes had gone! Mrs. White was sure that the o1d lady next to her had stolen them. She immediately thought of calling the police. But as she disliked making a fuss , she decided to take back the money from the old 1ady's hand bag and say nothing about it. She looked around to make sure nobody was watching. Then she carefully put her hand into the o1d lady's bag, took the notes, and put them into her own handbag.      When she got home that evening, Mrs. White showed her husband the beautiful hat she had bought.      \"How did you pay for it?\" Mr. White asked.      \"With the money you gave me for my birthday, of course\" she answered.  \"Oh? What's that, then?\" he asked, as he pointed to a wad of pound notes on the table. What did Mrs. White decide to do when she found another ten pounds in her neighbor's handbag on the bus?",

Looking back, I can see that, when I was only a little girl, he created an English environment by providing me with flashcards ,fun English- language toys and even dolls which can sing English songs! My interest in English had certainly been awakened when I began to learn English at school. Just imagine, he went a step further and asked me to learn New Concept English by myself! I was confused and even angry. I could not understand why a father could be so strict with his little girl. All the same, he never gave up and he gently insisted that I follow through with his idea. At first, I read stories with tears and I actually hated them because they were too difficult for me. In the end, I came to love the funny stories and, to be honest, my father was always there with a helping hand. I am sure that my English would never have got so far without his support.

      "question": "If you're networking   and nothing is happening, you might need to evaluate how you're doing it. Maybe you show up at each event and still feel challenged by the process. You aggressively talk to people, give out your cards, call endlessly to schedule an appointment but have no real success from your efforts. To help you gain a different future, here are ten habits you should avoid. Ineffective networkers: 1. Lack patience. They expect immediate results and want business now, not tomorrow. 2. Constantly \"selling\" something. They see dollar signs every time they shake hands with someone. 3. Too many choices. If they offer a variety of products, they might try too hard to tell about all of them. Offering too much information sends a confusing message making it difficult for people to send referral  . Opportunities are all around us but when you're networking, only focus on one. 4. Change positions too often. If they move from company to company or do something totally different, it might be difficult for people to keep up with them. 5. Lack manners and respect. They interrupt others, talk with food in their mouth, aren't very polite and appear unprofessional. They call people during dinner or on the weekends without thinking whether the occasion is suitable. 6. Distribute too many cards and sales literature. They come while loading with brochures, flyers  , catalogues and samples. 7. Focus on themselves. Too much self promotion can leave the other person to feel unappreciated. Every sentence begins with \"I\" and is all about their business. 8. \"Talking\" instead of \"giving\". They don't realize what other people sense when they are being very selfish. Others may think that they are being taken advantage of. 9. Lack authenticity   and personal values. They may create unrealistic expectations and not deliver on their promises. Sometimes doing things without integrity   possibly twists the truth. 10. Poor communication and interpersonal skills. They have trouble speaking effectively, building relationships and following up. Networking is a process that is an investment of time and money. If you find you're doing any of these habits, consider learning how to improve on these and maximize your results while networking.

The National Development and Reform Commission, the Standardization Administration of China, the Ministry of Agriculture and six other departments announced their 2004-05 development programme for national food standards over the weekend. China is conducting a rectification   within two years. Inspectors will search for all known banned materials in food production. To reduce trading barriers, China will raise the ratio of adopting international standards in the food industry to 55 percent from today's 23 percent. \"Safety is the first consideration for anything entering people's mouth followed by its nutritious value,\" said Hao Yu, secretary-general of the National Food Industry Standardization Technique Committee. He added the usage of food addictives   will be a major field for consideration in setting the new standards. On-the-spot checks during the past two years have shown the abuse   or misuse of addictives in food production and processing has become the biggest threat to food safety. In one case, talcum   powder was found in flour products, which is outlawed according to national food standards. \"At present there are no methods or standards to test the content of talcum powder in flour,\" said Shang Yan'e, an official with the national watchdog on grain and oil inspections.

There you can find fashion trends (,) and famous people. Sam and I walked down Camden High Street and made our way to a bridge over Regent's Canal. It is a 9-mile man-made river that goes through London. We went into a big market and saw crazy signs, fun T-shirts, and things like hand-made earrings for sale. We bought Chinese fried noodles. It tasted very different from the noodles we make at home, and we ate it with a fork instead of chopsticks! Camden is famous for the punk style that started in the 1970s. Punks walked around with bright pink and green hair, broken clothes with safety pins, metal buttons and pierced ears and lips. Punk music shops played loud, heavy rock music. But there were also groups of hippies with big sweaters. They sat in cafes drinking soymilk, with black clothes, black lipstick and painted white faces. Besides all these \"normal\" people, a lot of famous people come to Camden. Actor Orlando Bloom from Pirates of the Caribbean lives there. Camden is especially known as a home to famous musicians.

      "question": "Having driven almost thirty hours, I decided to stay in South Carolina for a few days. The next morning, I purchased a three-day fishing license and bait   before heading to the lake. Opening my trunk, I carefully took out my fishing gear  , put it on the lake's edge, baited up and began to fish. \"Good morning,\" said someone, walking up from behind me. Turning around, I saw a game warden   with a clip-board. \"Good morning,\" I said, nodding my head. \"Catch any fish?\" he asked. \"No sir, just relaxing and killing time.\" \"Can I see your fishing license?\" I handed him the license I had purchased at the bait shop. \"Can I see your driver's license, too?\" he requested. \"I see the name on the driver's license is spelled Kiser and the name on the fishing license is Kaiser,\" said the warden. \"The gentleman at the bait shop must have written it wrong,\" I told him. \"Well, I'm afraid I'll have to write you up for fishing with an invalid license and take away your fishing gear.\" \"You've got to be kidding,\" I responded, with a surprised look on my face. Sure enough I was written up and my fishing gear taken away. I was told that I would have to pay a fine and that my stuff would be sold at auction . I stood there almost in tears as he drove away. Those rods and reels were very special to me. I had used them over twenty years, fishing with my friends, who were now all dead. After returning home in Georgia, I telephoned South Carolina trying to explain the situation, but no one would listen. I was told that the Department of Fish and Game had a \"zero tolerance\" for fishing and hunting violations. Finally, in tears I paid the fine and gave up the fight. Nine months later, I received a letter. I had no idea who it was from as there was no return address. On a plain piece of notebook paper was written \"Auction for the Department of Fish and Game held this Saturday at 11:00 am.\" On Saturday, at six in the morning I headed to South Carolina. By ten o'clock I had found the auction. There were numerous boats and piles upon piles of fishing equipment. All at once, there it was--my wonderful stuff all thrown in a pile as if it was worth nothing. As the auction began I took my seat. In my wallet was twenty-seven dollars. For more than an hour I waited for my property to be brought to the auction block. \"We have three rods and reels here. I guess we will sell this as a unit,\" said the auctioneer. \"50 dollars,\" yelled someone in the crowd. \"51 dollars,\" yelled another man. I rose from my seat and walked out of the auction. \"66 dollars,\" I heard as the bidding continued. \"100 dollars,\" came another bid. The auction became silent. \"100 dollars once, 100 dollars twice, 100 dollars three times. Sold for 100 dollars,\" went the auctioneer. I walked to my truck, got in and just sat there. Suddenly I heard something hit the side of my truck. Turning around, I saw the back of a man putting my three rods and reels into my truck. It was the same game warden who wrote me the ticket almost a year ago! As I got out of the truck he stuck out his hand and said, \"I wasn't wrong. _ \" I shook his hand, thanked him and drove away. I cried as I crossed the South Carolina Georgia state line. What did the game warden mean by saying \"It's the law that is wrong\"?",

Last Friday, I got on the underground at 9.15a.m. It was very busy so there were no free seats. There were some teenagers sitting on the seats nearest me. I didn't know why they were not at school. They were talking loudly and laughing. It was difficult to read my newspaper with all the noise. A heavily pregnant  woman and her daughter got on at the next stop, with lots of shopping bags. I expected the teenagers to let them sit down. They saw the woman but did nothing. I had to ask them to give her a seat. They reluctantly did so but give me a rude look. I got off at the next stop and was glad that the teenagers didn't follow me. Last Saturday, I had dinner with my friend's family. I was expecting to meet his children, who I hadn't seen for ten years. During dinner, we started talking about world politics. It soon became clear that they didn't know much. They couldn't tell me the name of the King of Spain or the President of Italy. All they knew about was the Internet and which singers were the most beautiful. In my day, students knew the kings, queens and presidents of every country in Europe. I worry about the future of Germany. How could these young people become responsible workers and parents?

      "question": "Do you often feel lonely? What do you do when you feel that way? Hide yourself away and spend your time reading, watching TV or walking around? You might think that feeling lonely is just like feeling happy, sad or scared -- that it's just one of your various moods. That is true. However, if you let yourself be lonely for too long without dealing with it, you could be making a serious mistake. Doctors have known for some time that feeling lonely is bad for the mind. It can lead to mental health problems such as depression, stress and reduce confidence. \"Being lonely means not feeling connected or cared for, but it's not about being mentally alone,\" Lisa Jaremka, scientist from Ohio State University, US, told Live Science in January. And there's growing evidence that not having friends is connected with physical illness as well. In 2006, for example, scientists studied 2,800 women who had cancer. They found that those who had few friends or family were five times more likely to die of their disease than women with many social contacts. Also, even healthy people had a better chance of falling ill if they felt left out by others, according to the BBC. The results have scientists thinking that loneliness might hurt the immune system , which protects the body from diseases. Hoping to prove this theory, Jaremka and her research team put volunteers  through a stress test. During the test, volunteers were asked to make an unprepared speech in front of a group of stony-faced people. The researchers found that volunteers who said they were lonely in their daily lives felt more stress during the test. And their blood samples showed that all the stress had managed to cause harmful changes to their immune system. \"Loneliness has been thought of in many ways as a chronic stressor  -- a socially painful situation that can last for quite a long time, \" explained Jaremka, who led the study. The number of people suffering from loneliness is increasing all over the world. However, solving the problem is easier said than done. It won't work to just \"tell anyone to go out and find someone to love you\", said Jaremka. \"We need to create support networks.\" If people feel lonely for a long time,   _  .",

Modern medical bathing first became popular in Europe and by the late 1700's has also become popular in the United States. For many years frequent bathing was believed to be bad for one's health. Ordinary bathing just to keep clean was avoided , and _ was often used to cover up body smells! By the 1700's doctors began to say that soap and water were good for health. They believed that it was good for people to be clean. Slowly, people began to bathe more frequently. During the Victorian Age of the late 19th century, taking a bath on Saturday night became common. In the United States ordinary bathing was slow to become popular. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, many Americans were known as \"The Great Unwashed!\" In one American city , for example, a person was only allowed to take a bath every thirty days!

You don't necessarily have to have a lot of common interests with people in order to make friends with them. In fact, some of the most rewarding friendships are between two people who don't have much in common at all, but if you have something in common with people, it can make it a lot easier to start a conversation and plan activities together. Use the web and get out! Websites like Meetup.com are aiming to bring people together with common interest. You can join any group or just start your own. If you don't know of a specific topic, try searching for just a location. It's a great way to meet new local people!  Join a sports team. A common misconception about this is that you have to be really good at playing a particular sport in order to make friends with others on the team, but not all teams are so competitive. As long as you enjoy the sport and support your teammates, joining a local team with a laid-back attitude could be a great way to make new friends.  Volunteer. Volunteering is a great way for people of all ages to meet others. By working together you build bonds with people, and you might meet others who have a passion for doing things the way you do.

Apple has launched a new iPhone every year since it unveiled the range in 2007, selling more than 500 million units since then, and has traditionally launched key products in September. The iPhone 6, Apple's ninth iPhone model, is expected to be released in two different sizes:4.7-inches and 5.5-inches. The smaller of the two will be available first. Like iPhone5, the new model will come in silver , gold and space grey. The iPhone 6 will be powered by new operating system iOS 8. Through iOS8, users will be able to monitor  their health and fitness via HealthKit. HealthKit puts together numerous healthcare and fitness apps, such as blood pressure and heart rate monitors through partners including Nike, and allows them to communicate with each other. Users will be able to control home appliances and other connected devices through HomeKit, Apple's connected home framework. Similar to HealthKit, this app will organize your smart devices to control them in one place. One method of control will be via Siri-for example, you could tell Siri you were \"going to bed\", and it could dim the lights, lock your doors, close the garage door and set the room temperature. With the introduction of both of these key features, it's likely the iPhone 6 will take on even more of a lifestyle device role. It is designed to organize our lives and make everyday tasks easier and more efficiently completed.

Some beauty products can cause lasting damage that goes far below the surface of the skin. In America,many people use sunlight and non-natural light to darken their skin. Health experts advise against what is called\"tanning\"because of its links to akin cancer. In the African country of Senegal ,some women take health risks trying to do just the opposite. An average beauty supply shop in Dakar has many kinds of skin-lightening creams and soaps. The World Health Organization says that 25%of Senegalese women use skin-lightening production a usual basis. These products can contain chemicals,like mercury ,hydroquinone ,etc. These are dangerous ingredients that can cause cancer and possibly other physical damage to the akin. They can actually burn the eyes and skin. Shop worker Adama Diagne advises her visitors to avoid the stronger products that promise fast results. She users a cream that is made from carrots,not the strong chemical,hydroquinone. She says that it is a personal choice and that no one pressures her. Some women want to be black every day,but for her,she likes to be a shade of brown. Women in Senegal say they lighten their skin for the same reason that women all over the world make changes to their appearance. They say they want to look beautiful,to find a husband, to stand out in a crowd or simply to look great for a special event. This thinking troubles Senegalese film-maker Khardiata Pouye Sall.

The  town  of Pacific Grove loves the butterflies.Every year they have a parade and hundreds of children dress up as butterflies.Monarch butterflies are the town  _ .Tourism is very important,and many people come to see the butterflies.The butterflies are good for the development of the town.  In 1981 there were so many butterflies it looked like it was raining butterflies.Tens of thousands of Monarchs stayed on tree branches near Pacific Grove.Now there are not so many. The building goes on a little bit at a time,and you don't notice it day by day.Over time,you can see that there has been a lot of development.As new buildings go up,many trees are cut down. This reduces the natural homes for the butterflies. Monarchs travel hundreds of miles each year,returning to the same woods,often to the same trees.The female Monarchs need milkweed to lay their eggs;the males will follow the females. Millions of Monarchs have traveled regularly along the same path for thousands of years.They start their trip in the mountains of Mexico and travel to the middle part of America.If the woods where the butterflies live are destroyed,the whole species could be lost.There have been Monarch butterflies along the coast of California for as long as man can remember,but no one is sure how much longer they will last.

The beginning of our sleep-deficit(lack)crises can be traced back to the invention of the light bulb a century ago.From diary entries and our personal accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries, sleep scientists have reached the conclusion that the average person used to sleep about 9.5 hours a night.\"The best sleep habits once were forced on us, when we had nothing to do in the evening down on the farm, and it was dark.\" By the 1950s and 1960s, the sleep schedule had been reduced dramatically, to between 7.5 and 8 hours, and most people had to wake to an alarm clock.\"People cheat in their sleep, and they don't even realize they're doing it,\" says Dr.David.\"They think they're okay because they can get by on 6.5 hours, when they really need 7.5, 8 or even more to feel ideally energetic. \" Perhaps the most merciless robber of sleep, researches say, is the complexity of the day.Whenever pressures from work, family, friends and community increase, many people consider sleep the least expensive item on their programs.\"In our society, you're considered dynamic if you say you need only 5.5 hours' sleep.If you've got to get 8.5 hours, people think you lack drive and ambition.\" To determine the consequences of sleep-deficit, researchers have put subjects through a set of psychological and performance tests requiring them, for instance, to add columns of numbers or recall a passage read to them only minutes earlier.\"We've found that if you're in sleep deficit, performance suffers,\" says Dr.David.\"Short-term memory is weakened, as are abilities to make decisions and to concentrate.\" The major cause of sleep-deficit of modern people is   _  .",

      "question": "Visitors can find a small, old house called the O. Henry Museum in central Austin, Texas. William Sydney Porter(1862-1910)----better known as O. Henry, was one of America's best loved writers of short stories. Beginning in 1893, he lived here. It was saved from destruction, moved, and turned into a museum in 1934. The museum is a good way to learn about the interesting life of him. William Porter rented this house and lived with his wife and daughter for about two years. Many objects in the museum belonged to the Porters. Others did not, but are in the house to recreate the way it looked during their lifetime. Porter worked at a pharmacy, farm, land office and bank. He also loved words and writing. The museum has special proof of Porter's love of language---his dictionary. It's said that he read every word in it. Porter started a small publication called \"The Rolling Stone\". He wasn't being published early on, so he published himself. His funny stories, poems, and drawings were published in the magazine. But it was too costly to continue for long, so he closed the project after about one year. Other troubles would lead the Porters to leave Austin. Porter was accused of financial wrongdoing at the bank and lost his job. Fearing a trial, he fled the country. But he returned because his wife was dying. After her death, he faced trial and was found guilty. He served three and a half years in a federal prison in Ohio. Porter would keep his time in prison a secret. But there was one good thing about it. It provided him with time to write. By the time of his release, he had published 14 stories and was becoming well-known as O. Henry. Porter would later move to New York City and find great success there. He published over 380 stories in the last eight years of his life. What does the author want to tell us in the passage?",

Recently Al Gore produced the movie An Inconvenient Truthwhich explained the threats and told us how to control global warming. What it left out is that there is no proof that human activity is even causing global warming, let alone if global warming is even taking place. Global warming is the idea that greenhouse gases that shut in infra-red   radiation in the earth' s atmosphere are becoming more powerful and heating our planet up. The theory is that if the planet continues to heat up the polar ice caps could melt and cover the earth in water. Over the last 100 years the Earth has increased one degree in temperature, and sea level has risen millimeters. Even though this \"eye-opening\" news is taking place, there is no clear proof saying that it is due to global warming. It could be just a regular weather pattern the earth is circulating. The polar ice caps have not grown or reduced in size since man began tracking them. Also the ground-based temperature has remained the same besides growing cities. In fact most clues support the idea that global warming is not taking place and human activity isn't causing any earth to melt down.

      "question": "Relationships in general have gone downhill because of two factors:technology and our demanding drive for excitement. Body language, especially eye contact, is very important to a relationship. With one glance we can tell the mood of a close friend, if they are happy or sad. Thus, visual contact has a major impact on the amount of understanding we have with another person and the amount of connection that can be achieved. However, when the telephone, email and message come into play, all of that human interaction is lost. We have increasingly less human contact and start lacking social skills because of a lack of communication. Technology greatly influences our standpoint on how fast we think everything needs to be done. If you put a dollar in the soda machine, you expect the bottle to move forward and fall down to the bottom. You can' t count how many times you' ve  _ the machine if it went too slow for your expectations. You wanted instant results, immediate fulfillment. Another shot against healthy relationships is everyone ' s demanding need for excitement. Society in general has increased its expectations for excitement. Little kids spending time playing outside together now replace that with hours of playing video games alone at home. On the weekends we seize every minute with \" exciting\" activities, rushing from one to the next.

How she wanted that necklace, and when she asked her mother if she would buy it for her, her mother said, \"Well, it is a pretty necklace, but it costs an awful lot of money. I'll tell you what. I'll buy you the necklace, and when we get home we can make up a list of housework that you can do to pay for the necklace. And don't forget that for your birthday Grandma just might give you a whole dollar bill, too. Okay?\" Jenny agreed, and her mother bought the pearl necklace for her. Jenny worked on her chores very hard every day, and sure enough, her grandma gave her a brand-new dollar bill for her birthday. Soon Jenny had paid off the pearls. How Jenny loved those pearls. She wore them everywhere to kindergarten, bed and when she went out with her mother to run errands . The only time she didn't wear them was in the shower. Her mother had told her that they would turn her neck green! Jenny had a very loving daddy. When Jenny went to bed, he would get up from his favorite chair every night and read Jenny her favorite story. One night when he finished the story, he said, \"Jenny, do you love me?\" \"Oh yes, Daddy, you know I love you,\" the little girl said. \"Well, then, give me your pearls.\" \"Oh! Daddy, not my pearls!\" Jenny said. \"But you can have Rosy, my favorite doll. Remember her? You gave her to me last year for my birthday. And you can have her tea party outfit, too. Okay?\" \"Oh no, darling, that's okay.\" Her father brushed her cheek with a kiss. \"Good night, little one.\" A week later, her father once again asked Jenny after her story, \"Do you love me?\" \"Oh yes, Daddy, you know I love you.\" \"Well, then, give me your pearls.\" \"Oh, Daddy, not my pearls! But you can have Ribbons, my toy horse. Do you remember her? She's my favorite. Her hair is so soft, and you can play with it and braid it and everything.

She opened it and her beloved pearl necklace was inside. She let it slip into her father's hand. With one hand her father held the plastic pearls and the other he pulled out of his pocket a blue velvet   box. Inside of the box were real, genuine, beautiful pearls. He had had them all along.

After all, the Master Creator took his R&R (Rest and Recreation) on the seventh day, only after six days of \"definitely directed thought.\" 1 My friend Mike Litman wrote an article this week. 2It's called \"The Millionaire Composite\" and it analyzes one of the big differences between super-successful people and everyone else.

For many years, Bonestell had been creating beautifully detailed paintings of the Moon and planets. Viewers of his artwork were unhappy because the real Moon did not look like Bonestell's pictures of it. As a space artist, Bonestell tried to make his drawings look exciting and as true as the Moon is. He worked closely with astronomers and scientists to get the most up-to-date scientific information available. But in the 1940s and 1950s, no one had ever seen another planet up close. Yet Bonestell's paintings looked so real that some people thought they were photographs. Even though Bonestell was interested in astronomy, he did not start out as a space artist. As a young man he studied architecture -- the art and science of designing and making buildings. In 1938 Bonestell became a special effects artist in Hollywood. It was here that he learned he could improve his paintings by following the methods used in the movies. In 1944, a popular magazine published a series of Bonestell's paintings of the planet Saturn. He drew Saturn as if it were seen by someone standing on each of the planet's moons. The results were _ . Within a few years, Bonestell's artwork was appearing regularly in magazines and books on astronomy and space flight. Many of Bonestell's artworks had been right all along. But the biggest surprise was the Moon. Someone asked Bonestell what he was thinking when he saw the first pictures from the Moon. \"I thought how wrong I was!\" he said. \"My mountains were sharp  , and they aren't on the Moon.\" But he shouldn't have felt bad.

He focused on the experiences of 21 healthy Swedish boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 20. The teens kept what the authors described as \"regular working/studying hours\" and were not previously diagnosed with any particular sleep irregularity. He observed that the above-15 call group kept more irregular sleeping hours than the lower-use group,had more difficulty falling asleep,more difficulty waking up,and experienced more sleep disruptions . Bader said that among young people,a  ly recent technological invention like the cellphone has quickly become existed nearly everywhere,giving rise to considerable pressure to keep in touch. And this pressure can develop into an addiction,with serious negative results for teenager health. \"We see more and more people--especially the young generation-- who grew up with these kinds of items and gadgets in their hands,\" Bader said. \"And they become dependent on the technology. So,we have to teach young people to be structured. To know when to have the cellphone on,and when to switch it off. To avoid becoming the slave of technology,instead of the master. \" Dr. Mary Carskadon expressed little surprise with the finding. \" Interpersonal contact is one of the things that's best at keeping us awake,\" she observed. \"And so,a young person receiving cellphone texts or phone calls is going to have more deep disturbances. And they are going to be tired and restless,and probably,as a result,going to use more stimulants .And judgment is not always the best in our teenage years. So, that's where I think parental attention to this issue may be useful. \" What's the passage mainly about?",

      "question": "I don't like my parents. They always tell me I should do this, and should not do that. It sometimes makes me angry,\" said Liu Dan, a middle school student in Beijing. Do you have the same problem? Perhaps your parents had the same problem when they were your age long ago. Why does it seem that some parents are not so friendly in their children's eyes? One of the biggest things is when someone becomes a parent, he or she likes worrying things. They worry about everything about you from the time you were born. They do a lot for you, though something would make you angry, because they care about you and worry about you. They worry about your choice of friends, the food you eat, your work at school, how much sleep you get, etc. All these things are part of your life. They want you to grow up healthily and happily. So how can you make things easier on yourself? It's easier than you think. Just make sure your parents know what you're doing. Get them to know your friends. Call them if you stay somewhere else later than usual. Say sorry to them when you make mistakes. Take responsibility for what you have done. Talk about your ideas with them. They may talk about theirs with you. Most of all, try to think about why your parents do this or do that. They are still practicing being parents and need help you can give them. Someday, when you become a parent, they may be able to help you how to get on with your children. They are still practicing being parents. means    _   .",

      "question": "How to Be a Better Student Maybe you are a common student. You probably think you will never be a top student. This is not necessary so, however. Anyone can become a better student if he or she wants to. Here's how: Plan your time carefully. When you plan your week, you should make a list of things that you have to do. After making this list, you should make a schedule of your time. First set your time for eating, sleeping, dressing, etc. Then decide a good, regular time for studying. Don't forget to set aside enough time for entertainment. A weekly schedule may not solve all your problems, but it will force you to realize what is happening to your time. Find a good place to study. Look around the house for a good study area. Keep this space, which may be a desk or simply a corner of your room, free of everything but study materials. No games, radios, or television! When you sit down to study, concentrate on the subject. Make good use of your time in class. Take advantage of class time to listen to everything the teachers say. Really listening in class means less work later. Taking notes will help you remember what the teacher says. Study regularly. When you get home from school, go over your notes, review the important points that your teacher is going to discuss the next day, read that material. This will help you understand the next class. If you do these things regularly, the material will become more meaningful, and you will remember it longer. Develop a good attitude about tests. The purpose of a test is to show what you have learned about a subject. They help you remember your new knowledge. The world won't end if you don't pass a test, so don't be over worried. There are other methods that might help you with your studying. You will probably discover them after you have tried these. How can we remember what the teacher says?",

      "question": "Bill Fulton doesn't remember losing his wallet, but its return helped him remember the past. The leather stayed smooth and the cowboy design unblemished  . And when he looked inside, the contents brought back memories from 1946, when he apparently dropped the wallet behind the balcony bleachers   in the Baker Middle School gym. Fulton's Social Security Card and bicycle license, bearing the address where he lived during his teenage years, were positioned in their respective compartments, apparently untouched since the year after World War Il ended. Worker Nathan Osborne found the wallet -- along with old homework, lost library books and a 1964 talent show program -- while removing the bleachers for renovations on June 17. It was brought to Fulton's door the following day by Melanie Trindle, the Baker Middle School secretary. Middle School Principal Mindi Vaughan said the brown pine bleachers were connected to the gym balcony's brick wall and had remained in the same place since the school, known as the Helen M. Stack Building, opened in 1936. Fulton, 78, said he probably lost the wallet while cheering for the Baker High basketball team with a group of friends. Fulton said the bicycle ID was needed because he delivered medicine for Rodamar Drug. He was surprised, however, that his bicycle ID wasn't inside. He said he always kept it there. But rather than focus on what was inside the wallet, Fulton said the recovery has led him to reflect on his life -- one that took him to the Korean War and Berlin before the return to Baker City. He worked at Ellingson Lumber Company for 30 years, from March 1964 to April 1994. Since his retirement, Fulton has enjoyed spending time with his 11-year-old black dog, Smokey. The two often hike the nearby mountains. Trindle's knock on the door, wallet in hand, induced a slight ripple in his life, prompting him to consider the times he hadn't thought about in many years. \"Where did all the times go?\" Fulton said with a deep sigh. \"It' s hard to believe that the times have gone so fast.\" Fulton lost the wallet when  _  .",

When they are brought back to the earth, these seeds produce vegetables that are bigger and healthier than normal vegetables. However, some people worry about eating space vegetables. They think that space vegetables might not be good for us and could make us get sick because of the radiation in space. However, people should not be frightened because space vegetables are very healthy. Here are some facts that you should know about space vegetables. Space vegetables are grown from seeds that are carefully chosen. When seeds are brought back from space, they are tested to make sure that they will be safe to eat. Space vegetables are better for you than normal vegetables. For example, space tomatoes stay fresh for twenty days, which is one week longer than normal tomatoes. After genetically modified   food appeared in the market, people worried that they were eating unknown things. For example, if nut genes   are put inside potatoes, people allergic   to nuts might get sick from eating these potatoes because they do not know they are also eating nuts.

      "question": "There are some strong-minded people that are able to stop smoking today and be free from the addiction the next day. However, some smokers may have to seek help from medication   in order to kick the habit.      What medication actually does is to reduce the wish to smoke. Some of the medication must be taken with a doctor's guidance. The five most common medications to stop smoking are Bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches. People can buy nicotine gum and nicotine patches in chemists. However, the other medications require a prescription.      Zyban tablets have been found to be highly effective in curing people of smoking addiction. The tablet needs to be taken whole, without crushing  it, as crushing can lead to side effects. It can be bought on the prescription of a doctor.      Nicotine patches are filled with nicotine and they are applied to the skin. The skin takes in the nicotine and carries it to the blood stream. The amount of nicotine in these patches is quite limited, not enough to lead to addiction. But you shouldn't take them for dinner. In fact, millions of people have benefited from these nicotine patches.      Nicotine gum is supposed to be a safer choice. It is used in such a way that it comes into contact with the blood vessels   in the mouth and then releases the nicotine. The nicotine should not go through the stomach; otherwise, it may cause certain side effects.      These different types of medications have to be taken quite carefully.

      "question": "Every year on my birthday, from the time I turned 12, a white gardenia  was delivered  _ to me at my house. No card or note came with it. Calls to the florist   were always in vain ---- it was a cash purchase. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's identity.  But I never stopped imagining who the anonymous sender might be.  My mother often contributed to these imaginings. She'd ask me if there was someone for whom I had done a special kindness who might be showing appreciation. Perhaps the neighbor I'd help when she was unloading a car full of groceries. Or maybe it was the old man across the street whose mail I retrieved  during the winter so he wouldn't have to venture down his icy steps.  When I was 17, a boy broke my heart. The night he called for me the last time, I cried myself to sleep. When I awoke in the morning, there was a message scribbled  on my mirror in red lipstick: \"Heartily know, when half-gods go, the gods arrive.\" I thought about that quotation from Emerson   for a long time, and I left it where my mother had written it. When I finally went to get the glass cleaner, my mother knew everything was all right again. I don't remember ever slamming  my door in anger at her and shouting, \"You just don't understand!\" because she did understand.     One month before my high-school graduation, my father died suddenly of a heart attack. My feelings ranged from grief to abandonment, fear and over-whelming anger that my dad was missing some of the most important events in my life. I became completely uninterested in my upcoming graduation, the senior-class play and the prom-events  that I had worked on and looked forward to.  But my mother, in the midst of her own grief, would not hear of my missing out any of those things. The day before my father died, she and I had gone shopping for a prom dress and found a spectacular  one. Wearing it made me feel like a princess, but it was the wrong size, and when my father died the next day, I forgot all about the dress. My mother didn't. The day before the prom, I found that dress-in the right size, draped over the living room sofa, presented to me -- beautifully, artistically and lovingly. I didn't care about having a new dress, but my mother did. She wanted her children to feel loved and lovable, creative and imaginative.

      "question": "Sometimes people call each other \"freaked-cat\", but have you ever thought about this expression? When a cat is frightened, its heart starts beating faster, its muscles get tense, and there are changes in the chemicals in its bloodstream.Although the cat doesn't realize this, its body is getting ready for action.If the danger continues, the animal will do one of two things.It will defend itself, or it will run away as fast as it can. Something like this also happens to people.When we are excited, angry, scared, or aroused by other emotions (feelings), our bodies go through many physical changes.Our hearts beat faster, and our muscles get tense.All of these changes make us more alert and ready to react.We, too.get ready to defend ourselves or run. Human beings, however, have a problem that animals never face.If we give way to our feelings and let them take over, we can get into trouble.Have you ever said something in anger --or hit somebody--and regretted it later? Have you ever shouted at a teacher, told somebody you were lonely, or said you were in love, and then wished later you had kept your mouth shut? It isn't always clever to express your feelings freely. Does this mean that it's smarter always to hide our feelings? No! If you keep feelings of anger, sadness, and bitterness hidden away or bottled up inside, your body stays tense.Physical illness can develop.It can actually be bad for your health.(It isn't good to keep pleasant feelings inside either; all feelings need to be expressed.) Feelings that you keep all bottled up inside don't just go away.It's as if you bought some bananas and stuck them in a cupboard.You might not be able to see them.but before long you' d smell them.And if you opened the cupboard, chances are that you'd see little fruit flies flying all over them.They'd be rotten.

You may be wondering why you should study abroad. Here are some answers for you. * Timing The absolutely best time in your life to study abroad is when you are in college. If you miss this opportunity, it's almost impossible for you to do it later in life. * To gain cross-cultural experience Life overseas makes you see your everyday world in a whole new light. You don't even realize it, but our culture shapes the way we view the world and affects us every minute of the day.

Foreign languages are not only valuable in the job market but also valuable in the real world. * For the adventure Travel to other cities within your host country and around neighboring countries. As you get to know your new classmates, roommates, and host family, you will gain a unique view on the host culture. Discover the differences and, more importantly, the many similarities between your worlds. The friendships you make will last long after the program. * To learn more about yourself Find out who you really are. What are your limits? How do you overcome the difficulties you've never _ before? How independent are you? These questions are hard to answer until you are removed from your usual surroundings.

      "question": "It was the end of the school term and my son Tom had less than three months left before he would finish his six years at high school. During this time he had developed a love for basketball. Sadly, because of my work over the last twelve months, I had only been able to attend a few of his games; however, I was determined to get to his last game for the school term. Tom's team came out in the first 10 minutes with a burst of goals that saw them leading by just over 20 points at the end of the first half. The second half changed as the other team quickly played themselves back into the game. Tom's team started to miss an increasing number of shots. It was at that point that the coach called his first time out. The noise of the spectators   became quiet as the coach spoke to them. He had the team standing in a half circle, but he squatted   down, looking up at them and fiving some very calm and clear instructions on what they needed to do in the last couple of minutes. As he stood up to allow the team to return to the court, I saw him give some further words of encouragement to all of them. You could see that he knew that the team was fighting to save the game and that he needed to lift them up. By squatting down he placed himself in a position where he was talking up to them, rather than down or at them, and as the players went back onto the court his words of encouragement served to lift their energy and spirits. Well, Tom's team went on to win the final by 5 points. As I drove away I thought about what can happen to us all in our everyday life. One of my favourite quotes is about the half filled glass of water --- \"Is it half full or is it half empty?\" Like the coach, the answer to this quote all depends on how you look at things.

      "question": "Decisions, decisions! Our lives are full of them, from the small ones to the life-changing. The right to choose is central to everyone. Yet sometimes we make bad decisions that leave us unhappy or full of regret. Can science help? Most of us know little about the mental processes that lie behind our decisions. Luckily, what psychologists are finding may help us all make better choices. Here are some of their amazing discoveries to help you make up your mind. Consider your emotions. You might think that emotions are the enemy of decision making, but in fact they're a part of it. Whenever you make up your mind, your brain's emotional center is active. University of Southern California scientist, Antonio Damasio, has studied people with damage to only the emotional parts of their brains, and found that they were unable to make basic choices about what to wear or eat. Damasio thinks this may be because our brains store emotional memories of past choices, which we use to help the present decision making. However, making choices under the influence of an emotion can greatly affect the result. Take anger, for example. A study by Nitika Garg of the University of Mississippi and other scientists found the angry shoppers were more likely to choose the first thing they were offered rather than considering other choices. It seems anger can lead us to make quick decisions without much thinking. All emotions affect our thinking and motivation , so it may be best to avoid making important decisions under their influence. Yet strangely there's one emotion that seems to help us make good choices. The American researchers found that sad people took time to consider the various choices on offer, and ended up making the best choices. In fact many studies show that people who feel unhappy have the most reasonable view of the world. What do we learn from the text?",

We feel that there are many disadvantages in streaming(......) pupils. It does not take into account the fact that children develop at different rates. It can have a bad effect on both the bright and the not-so-bright child. After all,it can be quite discouraging to be at the bottom of the top grade! Besides, it is rather unreal to grade pupils just according to their intellectual  ability. This is only one aspect of their total personality. We are concerned to develop the abilities of all our pupils to the full, not just their academic ability. We also value personal qualities and social skills, and we find that mixed-ability teaching contributes to all these aspects of learning. In our classrooms, we work in various ways. The pupils often work in groups: this gives them the opportunity to learn to co-operate, to share, and to develop leadership skills. They also learn how to deal with personal problems as well as learning how to think, to make decisions, to analyze and evaluate, and to communicate effectively in order to have the ability to become leaders. The pupils learn from each other as well as from the teacher. Sometimes the pupils work in pairs;sometimes they work on individual tasks , and they can do this at their own speed. They also have some formal class teaching when this is suitable. We encourage our pupils to use the library, and we teach them the skills they need in order to do this efficiently.

      "question": "Ghostwriters are widely used by celebrities or public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies  . The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to significant. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent   writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a \"how-to\" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, and an outline, interviews with the celebrity or public figure. The credited authors also indicate to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or \"voice\" they want in the book. Celebrity books are usually ghostwritten in the first person (I did this and that) or the third person (David Pardon asked the group to recommend someone etc.). In some cases, such as with some \"how-to\" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this methodto increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates employ ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of John F. Kennedy's books were almost entirely ghostwritten. Former President Ronald Reagan also released a ghostwritten autobiography. A consultant or career-switcher may pay to have a book ghostwritten on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance their credibility as an \"expert\" in their field. For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become an inspiring speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published in the vanity press, which means that the author is paying to have the book published.

      "question": "The British psychoanalyst John Bowlby maintains that separation from the parents during the sensitive \"attachment\" period from birth to three may scar a child's personality and lead to emotional problems in later life. Some people have drawn the conclusion from Bowlby's work that children should not be subjected to day care before the age of three because of the parental separation it causes, and many people do believe this. But there are also arguments against such a strong conclusion. Firstly, anthropologists point out that the insulated love affair between children and parents found in modern societies does not usually exist in traditional societies. For example, in some tribal societies, such as the Ngoni, the father and mother of a child did not bring up their infant alone - far from it. Secondly, common sense tells us that day care would not be so widespread today if parents, care-takers found children had problems with it. Statistical studies of this kind have not yet been carried out, and even if they were, the results would be certain to be complicated and controversial. Thirdly, in the last decade, there have been a number of careful American studies of children in day care, and they have uniformly reported that day care had a neutral or slightly positive effect on children's development. But tests that have had to be used to measure this development are not widely enough accepted to settle the issue. But Bowlby's analysis raises the possibility that early day care has delayed effects. The possibility that such care might lead to, say, more mental illness or crime 15 or 20 years later can only be explored by the use of statistics. Whatever the long-term effects, parents sometimes find the immediate effects difficult to deal with. Children under three are likely to protest at leaving their parents and show unhappiness. At the age of three or three and a half almost all children find the transition to nursery easy, and this is undoubtedly why more and more parents make use of child care at this time. The matter, then, is far from clear-cut, though experience and available evidence indicate that early care is reasonable for infants.

      "question": "We like to think our intelligence is self-made; it happens inside our heads, the product of our inner thoughts alone. But the rise of Google, Wikipedia and other online tools has made many people question the impact of these technologies on our brains. Is typing in \"Who has played James Bond in the movies?\" the same as our knowledge about the names like Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig? Can we say we know the answer as long as we know how to rapidly get the information on Google? Here the question is about how we define intelligence itself. The answer appears to be interesting, because the evidence from psychological studies suggests that much of our intelligence comes from how we coordinate ourselves with other people and our environment. An influential theory among psychologists is that we're cognitive misers . This is the idea that we are unwilling to do mental work unless we have to. We try to avoid thinking things fully when a short cut is available. If you've ever voted for the presidential candidate  with the most honest smile, or chosen a restaurant based on how many people are already sitting in there, then you are a cognitive miser. The theory explains why we'd much rather type a zip code into Google Maps than memorize and recall the location of a place - it's so much easier to do so. Research shows that people don't tend to rely on their memories for things they can easily access. Buildings can somehow disappear from pictures we're looking at, or the people we're talking to can be changed with someone else, and often we won't notice - a phenomenon called \"change blindness\". This isn't an example of human stupidity - far from it, in fact - this is an example of mental efficiency. The mind relies on the world as a better record than memory. Philosophers have suggested that thinking is really happening in the environment as much as it is happening in our brains. The philosopher Andy Clark called humans \"natural born cyborgs \", those naturally capable of absorbing and combining new tools, ideas and abilities. In Clark's view, the route to a solution is not the issue - having the right tools really does mean you know the answers, just as much as already knowing the answer. Rather than being forced to rely on our own resources for everything, we can share our knowledge. Technology keeps track of things for us so we don't have to, while large systems of knowledge serve the needs of society as a whole. I don't know how a computer works, or how to grow vegetables, but that knowledge is out there and I can get to benefit. The internet provides even more potential to share this knowledge. Wikipedia is one of the best examples - an increasingly large database of knowledge from which everyone can benefit. So as well as having a physical environment - like the rooms or buildings we live or work in - we also have a mental environment, which means that when I ask you where your mind is, you shouldn't point toward the centre of your forehead. As research shows, our minds are made up just as much by the people and tools around us as they are by the brain cells inside our skull. Which of the following might the philosopher Andy Clark agree with?",

        "A": "Intelligence is something that is made by one's brain itself.",

      "question": "If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different. If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses. Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses' convention, of a story which works well because the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his food and stomps over to a table by himself. \"Who is that?\" the new arrival asked St. Peter. \"Oh, that's God.\" came the reply, \"but sometimes he thinks he's a doctor.\" If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it'll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman's notorious bad taste in ties. With other audiences you mustn't attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman. You will be on safer ground if you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system. If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural. Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and unforced manner. Often it's the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you are making a light-hearted remark. Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote \"If at first you don't succeed, give up\" or a play on words or on a situation.

      "question": "Surprisingly, no one knows how many children receive education in English hospitals, still less the content or quality of that education. Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \"the library lady\" or just \"the helper\". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly.

So it came as no surprise to learn that researchers believe crying and laughing come from the same part of the brain. Just as laughing has many health advantages, scientists are discovering that so, too, does crying. Whatever it takes for us to reduce pressure is important to our emotional   health, and a study found that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men report feeling better after crying. Besides, tears attract help from other people. Researchers agree that when we cry, people around us become kinder and friendly and they are more ready to provide support and comfort. Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we' re very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them. Just as crying can be healthy, not crying -- holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering -- can be bad for physical   health, Studies have shown that too much control of emotions can lead to high blood pressure, heart problems and some other illnesses.

      "question": "Chinese New Year Celebration is the most important celebration of the year. Chinese people may celebrate the Chinese New Year in slightly different ways but their wishes are almost the same; they want their family members and friends to be healthy and lucky during next year. Chinese New Year Celebration usually lasts for 15 days. Celebratory activities include Chinese New Feast, firecrackers, giving lucky money to children, the New Year bell ringing and Chinese New Year Greetings. Most of Chinese people will stop the celebrating in their home on the 7th day of New Year because the national holiday usually ends around that day, however celebrations in public areas can last until the 15th day of New Year. It is the money given to kids from their parents and grandparents as New Year gift. The money is believed to bring good luck, ward off monsters; hence the name \"lucky money\". Parents and grandparents first put money in small, especially-made red envelopes and give the red envelopes to their kids after the New Year's Feast or when they come to visit them on the New Year. They choose to put the money in red envelopes because Chinese people think red is a lucky color. They want to give their children both lucky money and lucky color.

      "question": "High school students have always spread gossip   in the halls, on the walls and on the phone. Now it's on the Internet, too. On various message boards, kids write about whom they hate, whom they think have fallen in love with each other and record other often hurtful things that may or may not be true. Sixteen-year-old Jessica remembers once when some kids at her school wrote cruel things about her on the web. \"They were just making fun of me,\" she says. They said she's really ugly, she's this, she's that, blah-blah-blah. Jessica's 11-year-old sister, Emma, admits she's used the web to write bad things about another girl, though she regrets it now. \"After a while, you may feel like, how could I have been so mean? Or, why did I do that?\" she says. Experts say gossip on the Internet can be more harmful than the old fashioned kind. It lasts longer and is taken more seriously. And, unlike ugly words on the bathroom wall, there's no way to get rid of it. If your kids are victims  of online gossip, Dr. Commanday suggests putting the gossip in to perspective  . \"Point out to them how what's being said on the screen differs from what everyone knows about you as a person,\" Dr. Commanday says. You can also try what worked from Emma: keep your kids off the offensive   website! \"When she was using it all the time, her name was there all the time.

This difficulty is much greater for those who do not work to a plan and have no regular routine of study . Many students muddle along , doing a bit of this subject or that , as the mood takes them , or letting their set work pile up until the last possible moment . Few students work to a set timetable . They say that if they did work out a timetable for themselves they would not keep to it , or would have to change it frequently , since they can never predict from one day to the next what their activities will be . No doubt some students take much more kindly to a regular routine than others . There are many who shy away from a self-controlled weekly timetable , and dislike being tied down to a fixed program of work . Many able students state that they work in cycles . When they become interested in a topic they work on it attentively for three or four days at a time . On other days they avoid work completely . It has to be admitted that we do not fully understand the motivation to work . Most people over 25 years of age have become used to a work routine , and the majority of really productive workers set aside regular hours for the more important areas of their work .

      "question": "Exhausted and unhappy, you still have to squeeze a smile to your friends, or teachers. That's just life, you may think. But new research suggests that putting on a fake smile can worsen people's mood and even lower work efficiency. Lead researcher Brent Scott with other researchers studied a group of bus drivers for two weeks. They tried to find out what happened when the drivers were involved in \"surface acting\" or fake smiling, and the opposite, \"deep acting\" which means people put on real smiles by recalling pleasant memories or thinking about their current situation more positively. The results showed that on days when drivers were forced to smile, they felt depressed and didn't want to work. On days when they smiled due to positive thoughts, their mood improved a lot as well as their work efficiency. The research goes against the popular belief among companies that employees should be cheerful to customers at all times. They include employees of shops, banks, call center workers and others who have face-to-face contact with members of the public. \"Smiling for the sake of  smiling can lead to emotional exhaustion and coldness, and that's bad for the organization,\" Scott told the Daily Mail. The study also showed that women were harmed more by fake smiling than men. Their mood and work performance both worsened more. But they were helped more by deep acting -- their mood became better and they worked more efficiently. However, while deep acting seemed to improve mood in the short term, Scott says it's not a long-term solution for unhappiness. \"There have been some suggestions that if you do this over a long period that you start to feel inauthentic ,\" Scott said. \"You may be trying to cultivate positive emotions, but at the end of the day you may not feel like yourself anymore.\" According to the article, which of the following statements about \"fake smiling\" is TRUE?",

My mom immediately asked where they kept their things. They pointed to an old car in a parking across the street. The girl said there were six of them living in that car, which was the same size as my own family. My mom said she had something to do after handing the people a few dollars. She sent me inside the restaurant with my dad and my three siblings. But she didn't come. Later, I found out she had gone home and practically emptied our cupboards into a few bags. Then, she brought that food over to the car and handed the bags to the family. I wasn't there when that part happened, but I can only imagine the joy it brought to their faces.

      "question": "I have been very lucky to have won the Nobel Prize twice. It is, of course, very exciting to have such an important recognition of my work, but the real pleasure was in the work itself. Scientific research is like an exploration of a voyage of discovery. You are continually trying out new things that have not been done before. Many of them will lead nowhere and you have to try something different, but sometimes an experiment does work and tells you something new and that is really exciting. However small the new finding may be, it is great to think \" I am the only person who knows this\" and then you will have the fun of thinking what this finding will lead to and deciding what will be the next experiment. One of the best things about scientific research is that you are always doing something different and it is never boring. There are good times when things go well and bad times when they don't. Some people get discouraged at the difficult times but when I have a failure, my policy has always been not to worry but to start planning the next experiment, which is always fun. It is very exciting to make a new discovery. Some people will do the strangest things for this excitement, such as going round the world in a balloon or walking to the North Pole. There are not many new places to explore but there is a lot of new information to be discovered in science and a journey into this unknown area can be much more worthwhile and just as exciting. I am sometimes asked, \"What do you have to do to win a Nobel Prize?\" My answer is: \"I don't know. I have never tried.\" But I know of one way not to win one. There are some people whose main reason for doing science is to win prizes and they are always thinking about how to do it. Such people don't succeed. To do good science you must be interested in it and enjoy doing experiments and thinking out problems. And, of course, you must be prepared to work hard and not to be too discouraged by failure.

It is said that a man named Craig found the little boy and took him to Dr. E. M. Gallaudet at Gallaudet College. Dr Gallaudet gave him the first name of Douglas, and the last name of Craig, after the man who found him.     Dr Gallaudet placed Douglas in the Kendall School, and he stayed there until he was old enough to work. He spent his life working in and around the halls of Gallaudet.

The happy couple went to Baltimore for a honeymoon, but the honeymoon only lasted for one day. Their plans were cut short when Douglas's pocketbook containing about $300 was either lost or stolen.     Douglas never got very far from Washington D.C. and Gallaudet College was his world.

Sometimes it's very difficult to get ourselves moving.The natural tendency is to postpone.Life just seems to get in the way! There is a job to go to, groceries to do, television to watch--whoops! I guess we get pretty good at finding excuses to escape getting started on goals like an exercise routine or reading a new book.The fact is that we are creatures of routine and habit.So what can we do to motivate ourselves to accomplish our goals? Here are some tips on how to get moving: Decide what you want.It's hard to motivate an aimless mind.Set a goal and decide how you are going to go about it.Then break it down into smaller sections so it's easier to handle and less overwhelming.  Keep track of your progress.Keep a log or journal where you can measure how much you have accomplished.Looking at it can also motivate you to keep pushing ahead. Post motivating pictures or slogans within your sight.It is always inspiring to see pictures of people who have accomplished what you're going for.It makes it attainable and realistic.Likewise, little slogans like \"go for it\" or \"just do it\" can give you the little support you need.  _ .If you remind yourself to go for the desired promotion, it will re-establish why you are doing what you're doing. Make it a habit.Once you have accomplished your objective, e.g.becoming an early riser, keep it up so that it's second nature to you and you don't have to think about it anymore.

      "question": "There is no denying that over the years college education has been accepted without the slightest doubt. All high school graduates should go, says conventional wisdom and statistical evidence, because college will help them earn more, become \"better\" citizens and be more responsible than those who don't go. But college can never work its magic for everyone. Now with half our high school graduates attending college, those unfit for the pattern are getting more. College graduates are selling shoes and driving taxis; college students interfere with each other's experiments and write false letters of recommendation in the fierce competition for admission into graduate schools. Others find no stimulation   in their studies, and consequently have to drop out, which is often encouraged by college administrators. Some observers say the fault lies with young people themselves --- they are spoiled and expecting too much. But that's a condemnation  of the students as a whole, and doesn't explain all campus unhappiness. Others blame our society. Both are partly right. We have been told that young people have to go to college because our economy can't absorb an army of untrained eighteen-year-olds. But disappointed graduates are learning that it can no longer absorb an army of trained twenty-two-year-olds, either. Some campus watchers suggest that college may not be the best, the proper or the only place for every young person after finishing high school. It seems that through the rosy   glow of our own college experiences, we may have been looking at those surveys and statistics upside down. Perhaps college does not make people intelligent, ambitious, happy, or quick to learn things--maybe _ . Intelligent, ambitious, happy, quick-learning people are merely those who are attracted to college in the first place. And perhaps all those successful college graduates would have been successful even without college education. This is heresy   to those who have been brought up to believe that if a little schooling is good, more has to be much better. But contrary evidence is beginning to pile up.

      "question": "The popular US drama series \"House of Cards\", which has already started its second season, features Chinese elements in its storyline. Traditional heroes are no longer sought after anymore. Today, it's unconventional leading figure -like Francis J. Underwood from \"House of Cards\" who are winning audiences' hearts. The political drama, which airs on the Internet service Netflix, has won the applauses of viewers around the world since its debut  on February 1, 2013. And it has caught the attention of real politicians, including US President Barack Obama. Kevin Spacey plays Francis J. Underwood, a cold-blooded Democrat who moves his way up the political ladder by any means necessary. He often uses his under-exposure in media to carry out misdeeds that will later benefit him. The revenge  theme plays a heavy role throughout the storyline, Underwood, who had high hopes for an appointment as Secretary of State in the first season, was betrayed by the US President and his former colleagues. He and his wife then conducted a plan of revenge and swore to unseat those who turned their backs against him. Through their plan, Underwood's own hunger for power grew and empowered him to get rid of whoever stood in his Way. The release of the trailer  of the second season excited millions of viewers around the world, including US President Barack Obama, who has been a loyal fan since the series debuted. Obama expressed his admiration for Underwood. \"This guy's getting a lot of stuff done,\" he said. Although the President is anxious to watch the story unfold, he'd like to do it at his own pace. After the release of the second season on February 14, 2014, Obama sent words on his Twitter account, \"Tomorrow: @HouseOfCards. No spoilers , please.\" The second season has promised to be darker, with more unexpected turnouts, and is to include more Chinese elements. \"Perhaps the team, including myself, has realized that in the next decade, Asia will be an extensively important region, and China will play an active role in its transition and change,\" says Spacey.

      "question": "Shakespeare's life can be divided into three periods: the first 20 years in Stratford, which includes his schooling,early marriage, and fatherhood;the next 25 years as an actor and playwright   in London; and the last five in retirement back in Stratford where he enjoyed the wealth gained from his theatrical   successes. The years linking the first two periods are marked by a lack of information about Shakespeare, and are often referred to as the \"dark years\". Shakespeare probably left school at 15, and took some sorts of jobs, especially since this was the period of his father's financial difficulty. A great number of references in his plays suggest that William may have in fact worked for his father, thus gaining specialized knowledge. At some point during the \"dark years\", Shakespeare began his career with a London theatrical company -- perhaps in 1589 -- for he was already an actor and playwright in 1592. Shakespeare apparently wrote and acted for Pembroke's Men, as well as a lot of others, in particular Strange's Men, which later became the Chamberlain's Men. When, in 1592, the theaters were closed for about two years, due to a terrible disease. Shakespeare turned to writing book-length poetry. Most _ were Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, both of which have been translated into many languages and even been included in students' textbooks. During this same period, Shakespeare was writing his sonnets  , which are more likely signs of the time's fashion rather than actual love poems detailing any particular relationship. He returned to play writing when theater reopened in 1594, and published no more poetry. His sonnets were published without his permission in 1609, shortly before his retirement. His final play was Henry VIII, two years before his death in 1616. According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true?",

As he looked out, a fantastic smell came to his nose. \"Cheese!\" the mouse said happily to himself. \"I'll go and get it now and have it for breakfast.\" But then he remembered his parents' words. His parents were very clever mice and often said to their son, \"Always wait before you go for a piece of cheese.\" So the young mouse waited quietly. Then he heard a quiet \"Miaow\" and he knew the cat was there. He stayed in the hole and said to himself, \"I'm glad I listened to my parents and learned to wait.\" The next day, he looked out again. He put his nose out of the hole, and the beautiful smell of cheese came to his nose again. He could see the cheese. It was only a few centimetres away. But he sat still and waited quietly. This time he did not hear any cat's noise. Instead he heard a very quiet \"Woof, woof.\" \"It's a dog!\" he thought. \"If the dog is there, the cat won't be there. I expect the dog has chased the cat away, so I'm safe.\" The mouse ran out of the hole and started eating the cheese. He did not see the cat, which caught him and ate him.

The best available evidence suggests that climate changes since the 1970s may already be causing over 150,000 deaths annually, and that greenhouse gas emissions would increase disease burdens  in  the  coming  decades.The  risks  are concentrated in the poorest population, who have contributed least to the problem. The Kyoto Protocol   is signed by 128 nations,and commits the participating industrialized countries to cutting emissions of greenhouse gases by over 5% below 1990 level by the period of 20082012. \"Over 600 thousand people died in weatherrelated disasters in the 1990s.Temperature and rainfall influence the rates of diseases and infections including malaria,and malnutrition,which together cause over 3.5 million deaths a year.The Kyoto Protocol is the first step towards protecting the climate system,which exerts such a strong influence on our health\",said Dr Kerstin Leitner,Assistant DirectorGeneral for Sustainable Development and Healthy Environments. While acting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is also essential to protect vulnerable   communities from the effects of climate changes.WHO works to promote measures such as protection from malaria and other climate sensitive diseases, and reliable access to clean water and sanitation, for people  in the  most vulnerable developing countries.Increasing disease control efforts will also help to protect current and future generations from the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.

There's even a clock tower with a massive bell that rings for special events. Cushing Academy has all the characteristics of a New England school, with one exception. This year, after having had a collection of more than 20,000 books, officials have decided the 144-year-old school no longer needs a traditional library. They have decided to give away all their books. The future, they believe, is digital. \"When I look at books, I see an outdated technology,\" said James Tracy, headmaster of Cushing. \"We're not discouraging students from reading.

      "question": "EACH of us fails from time to time. If we are wise, we accept these failures as a necessary part of the learning process. But all too often we convey to our children either by words or by actions that failure is something to be ashamed of, that nothing but top performance meets our approval. Donnie was my youngest third-grader. His fear of failure kept him from classroom games that other children played excitedly. He seldom answered questions - he might be wrong. He seldom finished his work because he repeatedly checked with me to be sure he hadn't made a mistake. I tried my best to build his self-confidence. But nothing changed until midterm, when Mary Anne, a student teacher, was assigned to our classroom. She was young and pretty, and she loved children. My pupils, Donnie included, adored her. But even enthusiastic, loving Mary was _ by this little boy who feared he might make a mistake. Then one morning we were working math problems. Donnie had copied the problems with painstaking neatness and filled in answers for the first row. Pleased with his progress, I left the children with Mary. But when I returned, Donnie was in tears. He'd missed the third problem. Mary looked at me in despair. Suddenly her face brightened. From the desk we shared, she got a canister   filled with pencils. \"Look, Donnie,\" she said, \"I've got something to show you.\" She removed the pencils and placed them on his desk. \"See these pencils, Donnie?\" she continued. \"They belong to Mrs. Lindstrom and me. See how the erasers are worn? That's because we make mistakes too. Lots of them. But we erase the mistakes and try again. That's what you must learn to do, too.\" She kissed him and continued: \"I'll leave one of these pencils on your desk so you'll remember that everybody makes mistakes, even teachers.\" Donnie looked up with love in his eyes and just a glimmer   of a smile. The pencil became Donnie's prized possession.

      "question": "When you tidy your messy bedroom, it gets a lot easier to find things. Dreams may work the same way for a messy brain, helping you learn by organizing memories and ideas. To test how much dreams can help learning, Robert Stickgold had some students play a shape-fitting game called Tetris   for a few hours and then go to sleep. Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes. Interestingly, the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most. Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream, many important tasks are getting done. The brain decides what to keep and what to forget. It is connecting new experiences to older learning. In fact, the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions . At night, emotions are in the driver's seat. People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward. Often the dream event changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset. So if your best friend moves away, you might dream that you're the one who's moving. In fact, dreams have a proven power to improve mood, and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't. Everybody dreams for a couple of hours every night--in the course of your life, you'll spend about 25 years asleep and 6 years dreaming.

While ocean warming has been the primary focus for scientists and ocean policy managers, cold events can also whiten corals. A new study by scientists compared damaged to corals exposed to heat as well as cold stress. The results show that cool temperatures can cause more damage in the short term, but heat is more destructive  in the long run. Climate change is widely known to produce warming conditions in the oceans, but extreme cold-water events have become more frequent and serious as well. In 2010, for example, coral reefs around the world faced on of the coldest winters and one of the hottest summers on record. During a unique experiment, corals under cold temperatures suffered greater damage in just days compared with heat treated corals. Yet the researchers found that corals were eventually able to adjust to the cold conditions, make their health stable and continue to grow. However, over the long term corals subjected to heat suffered more greatly than those in cold, with evidence of severe whitening and growth stoppage, which leads to death. The coral's ability to adjust to cool temperatures surprised the researchers, who say the study's results show the complexities  of monitoring coral health in response to different environmental factors . \"Global warming is associated with increases but also decreases of temperatures,\" said Deheyn, one of the researchers. \"Not much has been known about the comparative effects of temperature decrease on corals.

But a recent survey has showed that such ambitions lack the required support and remain just that -- dreams. The Shanghai Municipal Employment Promotion Center poll of 1,276 graduates in several universities and colleges in the city, released last Friday, showed 59.78 percent of respondents considered the possibility of setting up a company or at least a small store. \"But they just stop at the 'thinking' stage,\" it stated. Respondents put the top reasons for not going it alone down to a shortage of investment and a lack of business opportunity. They also listed lack of business experience and social networks, the need for advanced study and objections from family members as factors that stood in their way. More than 90 percent of the interviewees said they would rather take up a job after graduating and then consider starting their own business two or three years down the road. Guo Bing, a senior student in Shanghai International Studies University majoring in English, decided he wanted to be his own boss last year. But he is looking for a job first. \"If I fail to find a satisfying job, I would like to establish a company in exhibition services,\" Guo said.

He is also confident that his English language skills can help him do well in the industry. \"Social networking is an important factor leading to business success,\" Guo said. Guo said that the shortage of graduate jobs is the main reason driving more university students to set up a business right after their graduation. Jiang said the university sets up a business guide team made of government officials and professionals.

        "question": "George Gershwin was born in New York City in 1898. His parents were Russian Jews who had immigrated to the United States. George and his two brothers and sister had a close, happy family life. George liked playing games on the streets of New York. He liked exploring the city. He did not like school or studying. While exploring the city, George heard jazz and blues music in and out of public drinking places. However, he did not become seriously interested in music until he heard another boy playing the violin in a concert at his school. George began to take piano lessons. His teacher was a fine classical musician. He immediately recognized George's unusual ability. The teacher wrote about him to a friend: \"I have a student who will make his mark in music, if anybody will. The boy is a genius, without doubt. \" George studied classical piano. But his strongest interest continued to be jazz and popular music. At the age of fifteen, he left school and went to work in the music business.  At that time, the New York City street where most music publishers had their offices was called \"Tin Pan Alley.\" The piano players played the songs all day long to interested singers and other performers. George Gershwin was one of the youngest piano players in Tin Pan Alley. Soon, he was considered one of the finest there. He was already writing his own songs. He succeeded in getting one published when he was only eighteen years old. George Gershwin was now a real composer. The rest of his life was an unbroken record of success. He wrote song after song. His ideas were so endless that he was not even troubled when he once lost some music he had been writing. \"There is plenty more where that came from,\" he said. George Gershwin had his first big hit in 1919, when he was twenty-one years old. It was a song called \"Swanee.\" A popular entertainer, Al Jolson, sang the song. \"Swanee\" was made into one of the first musical recordings. George Gershwin was suddenly famous.

According to the study, teenagers who eat breakfast weigh around 5 pounds less than teenagers who do not. Although they take in more calories in the morning, they are more active during the day because they have more energy. This means they burn more calories than non-breakfast eaters. _  The study also showed that eating breakfast keeps teenagers feeling full for longer, so they will not eat too many snacks later in the day. This is good news as most popular snacks, like sweets and potato chips, are usually unhealthy and full of calories. Another big advantage of eating breakfast is that it helps teenagers do better at school. This is because it gives them more energy to keep their attention in class.

In the last forty years, business contacts between Japan and the West have become very important. Many foreign companies now have offices in Japan and Japanese businessmen do business around the world. Differences between Japanese and Western ways of doing business, however, often _ and make doing business in Japan difficult for foreigners. The American businessman, for example, wants to start talking business immediately. He does not want to wait. The Japanese businessman, on the other hand, likes to arrive at decisions after giving them serious thought. Another thing foreign businessmen have difficulty in understanding is when a Japanese means \"Yes\" or \"No\". This is because of cultural differences between Japanese and Western society , Which make it difficult for a Japanese to say \"No\" directly. In the USA, it is easy to say \"No\" to something one does not want to do. But in Japan, it is very difficult to say \"No\". To refuse an invitation or a request  with \"No\" is felt to be impolite. It is thought to be selfish and unfriendly. So instead of saying \"No\" directly, the Japanese have developed many ways to avoid  saying \"No\". These can help them avoid hurting other people's feelings. However, this often makes their ways of doing business rather difficult for foreigners to understand and follow.

Neither do they know a simple but important fact: Memory can be improved. If you'll just accept that, the following will show you how. First, relax. If you are over worried about something, you'll forget it. If you keep telling yourself that your memory is bad, your mind will come to believe it and you won't remember things. When you forget something, don't follow up with saying like \"Oh, my god! I always forget things!\" Such words will have a bad result on you and your memory. But relaxing isn't enough. To improve your memory, you'll need to take an active role. Like your body, your memory can be made strong through exercise. Look for _ to exercise your memory. For example, if you're learning a language, try to actively remember a lot of new words. If you don't take notice of things actively, you won't remember them.

I felt bad too because I regretted not spending more time with him while he was here. I wished I had visited him more, talked with him more, and listened to him more.

They make too much noise in shopping malls; they drive recklessly up and down America's main streets; they carry chips on their shoulders as big as the Sears Tower. And at least some of the time those things are true. But we shouldn't forget that there are hard moments in the life of a teenager too. I watched such a moment not long ago at a woman's funeral. I didn't expect the event to affect me. Through much of the ceremony, in fact, I remained unmoved. The teenage grandson stepped forward. With his very first deep breath, every heart in that church was achingly reminded of something we had all forgotten. Softly he began: \"I want to share a few values that Nana taught me. She never failed to see light in any situation. When our family dog would truly attack her, what would Nana say? 'oh, what beautiful barking that dog has!' That was Nana. \" \"She was a strong woman who often lived in the shadow of my grandpa, who was a successful businessman in this city. But she was the one behind the scenes who provided the strength and support for my grandpa's career,\" he said, with a voice now trembling, \"That was Nana's way.\" Through a low sob, he continued, \"Whenever she did anything worth recognition, you'd have to hear about it from a different source, because she was never one to show off.\" Finally, in a voice breaking free of sorrow, he looked up and said, \"Nana taught me courage. She put up an incredible fight to the end, when she died peacefully, which is how she lived her life. That was Nana's way, and I hope I can carry on in the same manner.\" There are no hearts as sensitive as those of teenagers, because everything is happening to them for the first time. The trouble with teenagers is that they haven't learned to be controlled. When that boy rose to speak about the woman who surely had been his truest and closest friend, his honest voice dragged each of us out into the open where we could no longer hide in the calm ceremony. He exposed us to the truth about this very real woman who believed in a boy who probably tried the patience of many adults. He reminded us that his grandmother was more than another dot on the chart of life and death. All over again we felt those powerful losses crossing our own hearts, and we knew that when you say good-bye to something happy, something young in yourself.

Here are some tried and true tips: Get the person responsible You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the \"person in charge\". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in. Get the name of the person If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her. Get past the receptionist In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out: * Call back Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence   to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say \"thank you\" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name. * Call when the secretary is out You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through. Ask three times for an interview Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe. Arrange a time If the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time. In the writer's opinion, who should you talk to if you want to get a job by making phone calls?",

This would be her first trip with her father on what he had always been famous for. Larry first began diving when he was his daughter's age. Similarly, his father had taken him along on one of his expeditions. Since then, he had never looked back. Larry started out by renting diving suits from the small diving shop just along the shore. He had hated them. They were either too big or too small. Then, there was the instructor. He gave him a short lesson before allowing him into the water with his father. He had made an exception. Larry would never have been able to go down without at least five hours of theory and another similar number of hours on practical lessons with a guide. Children his age were not even allowed to dive. After the first expedition, Larry's later diving adventures only got better and better. There was never a dull moment. In his black and blue suit and with an oxygen tank fastened on his back, Larry dived from boats into the middle of the ocean. Dangerous areas did not prevent him from continuing his search. Sometimes, he was limited to a cage underwater but that did not bother him. At least, he was still able to take photographs of the underwater creatures. Larry's first expedition without his father was in the Cayman Islands. There were numerous diving spots in the area and Larry was determined to visit all of them. Fortunately for him, a man offered to take him around the different Spots for free. _ The diving spots afforded such a wide array of fish and sea creatures that Larry saw more than thirty varieties of creatures. Larry looked at his daughter. She looked as excited as he had been when he was her age. He hoped she would be able to continue the family tradition.

It is also called the Doll's Festival because on that day,families get a set of dolls at home for their daughters. It is celebrated because the parents want their daughters to be strong and healthy. The 753 Festival is for children aged three, five and seven years old. Japanese people think that these three ages are the luckiest ones in one's life. On that day, these children get special candies wrapped in beautiful bags.The candy is a symbol of a long and healthy life for these children. The 753 Festival falls in November. According to the passage,why do the girls in Japan always receive dolls on Girl's Day?",

        "question": "Monkeys prefer heavy metal to classical music, according to researchers at the University of Wisconsin whose findings are published this week in Biology Letters. Scientists played a selection of music to a group of South American cotton-top monkeys but the only sound that got a reaction were from the heavy metal band Metallica. They were seemingly disinterested in Led Zeppelin, Miles Davis and Bach, but after the beautiful sound of Master of Puppets by Metallica was played the monkeys calmed down. \"Monkeys interpret rising and falling sounds differently than humans. Oddly, their only response to several samples of human music was a calming response to the heavy-metal band Metallica,\" said Professor Charles Snowdon, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Rather than making them excited or aggressive, the heavy metal tracks had a comforting effect. Dr Snowdon, who teamed up with National Symphony Orchestra musican David Teie, also played the monkeys music composed specifically for them. Although they enjoyed Metallica, they were much more interested in these pieces. A melody  based on the short calls of scared monkeys led to anxiety levels rapidly growing, researchers found, while one based on long calls the creatures make when they are happy had a calming effect. Frans B.M. de Waal, a professor of psychology at Emory University who studies animals, said the findings appear to say more about how monkeys respond to the sounds they make than they do about music or the evolution of music. Dr Snowdon no longer has a monkey colony to use in his research, but he said his co-author David Teie is exploring the concept of music for cats. \"If we understand how we can affect their emotional states through using musical sound and aspects of our speech, maybe those of us living with companion animals can have a better relationship with them, too,\" Snowdon said.

        "question": "While learning the science lessons, I used to get a doubt--why ear, nose, tongue and eyes should be called as special senses? The basic reason is that these are the channels through which we maintain contact with the surroundings. Though apparently it may feel like these are individual sensory organs, they do show some connectivity. Interestingly, our hearing is less sharp after we eat a heavy food. Isn't it good for a sound nap after a stomach-full meal? That does not mean we go deaf after a meal, but the hearing pitch does change after a heavy meal. We usually give credit of the taste to our tongue, but do you know that unless saliva dissolves something, our tongue cannot recognize the taste of the food eaten. Taste is nothing but the food chemicals dissolved in the saliva being sensed by the taste buds present on the tongue. Try to dry off your tongue and mouth with a tissue paper and then taste something. Women are much better smellers than men. They are born with this characteristic ability and can correctly recognize the exact fragrance of the sample. We all can store almost 50,000 different smells, which are strongly tied to the memories. Pupils do not respond to light alone, but to the slightest bit of noise around too. Thus surgeons, watchmakers and those professionals who have to perform a much delicate job do prefer to have a sound-free environment. Even a small noise can enlarge their pupils, change the focus and make their vision less clear. Each and every one of us has a particular or individualistic or characteristic smell, which is unique to us, except the twins. This smell is very subtle yet can be sensed even by a newborn. It may be due to this smell that the newborn recognizes the presence of his parents around. Which of the following may be the best title of this passage?",

        "question": "Sleeping for less than six hours a night greatly increases the risk of dying from a heart attack or stroke , a study has found. It is the stuff of nightmares for those whose busy work schedule or busy family life means getting up early and staying up late. Scientists claim that the modern tendency to delay going to bed in order to get through more of the items on the 'to do' list has serious health consequences. But take care. Those who have too much sleep are also more likely to suffer a heart attack. While the extra sleeping is unlikely to be the cause, long-term illnesses such as heart disease often make sufferers feel tired, so sleeping for longer than nine hours a night may be an early warning sign.    Researchers found that those who slept for less than six hours were almost 50 per cent more likely to suffer a heart attack and 15 per cent more at risk of strokes. They believe that not having enough sleep disrupts the balance of two key hormones , ghrelin and leptin , which control the appetite. Poor sleepers tend to eat more and are more likely to be fatter, so are at greater risk of high blood pressure and heart disease, which lead to heart attacks and strokes. Experts recommend adults get at least six or seven hours' shut-eye a night to stay healthy.     But as many as 60 per cent of us do not think we are sleeping enough, with a third suffering from sleeplessness. The researchers, from the University of Warwick, warned that trying to push too much into one day by going to bed late and getting up early could lead to serious illnesses later in life. They looked at the sleeping habits of almost 475,000 participants from 15 previous studies across eight countries, including the UK, the U.S., Japan, Sweden and Germany. Their findings, published in the European Heart Journal, show that those who slept for less than six hours were 48 per cent more likely to develop or die from heart disease and 15 per cent more likely to develop or die from a stroke. Not having enough sleep decreases the levels of leptin in our blood, which means we do not feel as satisfied after eating. At the same time, it raises the levels of ghrelin, responsible for triggering  our appetite, thus making us feel hungrier.     The scientists believe that our 'work hard, play hard' society encourages us to sacrifice sleep and ignore our health. The trend for late nights and early mornings is actually a ticking time bomb for our health so you need to act now to reduce your risk of developing these life-threatening conditions.

China became the world's second-largest auto market and third-largest car-maker in 2006. It has also become the second-largest greenhouse gas producer in the world, and is rapidly catching up with the United States. In this sense, China's participation will greatly promote the Car-Free Day movement. The number of cars on the road is going up rapidly in China. In Beijing, about 1,000 new cars are added to the streets on an average day. Cars certainly offer people plenty of freedom to move around. But in many Chinese cities, appearance of too many cars has turned into a major problem. Getting stuck in traffic jams is an everyday experience for drivers. Even worse is the environmental impact caused by cars. According to a national report, on a \"smog day\", 79 percent of the air pollution is caused by cars. The growing number of traffic accidents is another problem. Over 100,000 people die from traffic accidents every year in China, which is by far the highest number of road deaths in the world. 108 cities' participation in Car-Free Day shows growing public concern about the traffic and environmental problems caused by cars. On this day, all cars were banned from running in selected areas of the participating cities. People were encouraged to walk, cycle and use public transport. According to experts, the carbon monoxide in the atmosphere produced by cars was reduced by 3,000 tons on Car-Free Day. With cleaner air and smoother traffic flow on the day, more cities will hopefully want to join the event next year.

Her next ideas, however, did. She said that we should go around right then to our neighbors and collect all their change to send to the animal shelters  .

Facebook then attempts to make money by selling their data to advertisers that want to send targeted messages. Most Facebook users don't realize this is happening. Even if they know what the company is up to, they still have no idea what they're paying for Facebook because people don't really know what their personal data is worth. The biggest problem, however, is that the company keeps changing the rules. Early on, you keep everything private. That was the great thing about facebook--you could create your own little private network. Last year, the company changed its privacy rules so that many things-- your city, your photo, your friends' names--were set, by default  to be shared with everyone on the Internet. According to Facebook's vice-president Elliot Schrage, the company is simply making changes to improve its service, and if people don't share information, they have a \"less satisfying experience\". Some critics think this is more about Facebook looking to make more money. Its original business model, which involved selling ads and putting them at the side of the page, totally failed.  Who wants to look at ads when they're online connecting with their friends? The privacy issue has already landed Facebook in hot water in Washington. In April. Senator Charles Schumer called on Facebook to change its privacy policy. He also urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social-networking sites.\"I think the senator rightly communicated that we had not been clear about what the new products were and how people could choose to use them or not to use them,\" Schrage admits. I suspect that whatever Facebook has done so far to invade our privacy, it's only the beginning, which is why I'm considering deactivating my account.

According to the World Bank's education specialist, Harry Patrinos, this include: improving the quality of teachers and making sure that teachers are highly regarded; providing information to make schools accountable and giving autonomy to schools and head teachers. This matters not only for individual pupils but also for the well-being of countries, he says, because improving educational performance has a direct impact on improving economic performance. China's education performance-- at least in cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong-- seems to be as spectacular as the country's fast growing economy. Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities consider education to be important and are willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year. \"Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,\" says Prof Cheng. Under the banner \"First class city, first class education\", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classroom, upgrading schools and improving the curriculum in the last decade. It got rid of the \"key schools\" system which concentrated resources only on top students and top schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China. Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s.Its survival as a service and management hub depends on upgrading knowledge and skills. In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on closing the gap for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants.

Unlike marine   mammals,which have a layer of blubber  to keep them  warm,penguins depend on their waterproof feathers.Without them,Pierre was unwilling to jump into the swimming pool and ended up trembling on the side of the pool while his 19 peers played in the water. \"He was cold:he would shake,\"said Pam Schaller,a senior biologist.Schaller first tried a heat lamp to keep Pierre warm.Then she got another idea:if wetsuits keep humans warm in the cold Pacific,why not make one for Pierre? Schaller designed the suit,which covered Pierre's body and had small openings for his flippers. \"I would walk behind him and look at where there were any gaps.and cut and refit until it looked like it was extremely suitable.\"she said.

        "question": "Amusement parks make most of their money from admission fees paid by guests attending the park. Other sources include parking fees, food and drink sales and souvenirs. Practically all amusement parks operate using one of two admission principles:         Pay-as-you-go In this form, a guest enters the park at little or no charge. The guest must then buy rides one by one, either at the attraction's entrance or by buying ride tickets. The cost of the attraction is often based on its complexity   or popularity. The park may allow guests to buy unlimited admissions to all attractions within the park. A pass is then shown at the attraction entrance to gain admission.        Disneyland opened in 1955 using the pay-as-you-go form. Initially, guests paid the ride admission fees at the attractions. Soon, the problems of dealing with so many coins led to the development of a ticket system that, while now out of use, is still part of the amusement-park vocabulary. In this new form, guests bought ticket books that contained a number of tickets, with \"A,\" \"B\" and \"C.\" Rides and attractions using an \"A-ticket\" were generally simple, with \"B-tickets\" and \"C-tickets\" used for the larger, more popular rides. Later, the \"D-ticket\" was added, then finally the now-famous \"E-ticket,\" which was used for the biggest rides, like Space Mountain. Smaller tickets could be traded up for use on larger rides. Disneyland, as well as the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, gave up this practice in 1982.        The advantages include:        guests pay for only what they choose to experience         attraction costs can be changed easily         The disadvantages include:        guests may get tired of spending money almost continuously         guests may not spend as much on food or souvenirs According to the pay-as-you-go principle, guests   _  .",

He was reaching the high school age, but his hometown offered no high school for blacks. Fortunately he had a strong--willed caring mother. John remembered that his mother told him many times, \"Son, you can be anything you want really to be if you just believe.\" She told him not to depend on others, including his mother. \"You have to learn success\" she said. \"All the people who work hard don't succeed, but the only people who do succeed are those who work hard.\" These words, came from a woman with less than a third grade education. She also knew that believing and hard work don't mean everything. So she worked hard as a cook for two years to save enough to take her son, who was then 15, to Chicago. Chicago in 1933 was not the promised land that black southerners were looking for. John's mother and stepfather could not find work. But here John could go to school, and here he learned the power of words--as an editor of the newspaper and yearbook at Du Sable High School. His wish was to publish a magazine for blacks. While others discouraged him, John's mother offered him more words to live by \"Nothing beats a failure but a try.\" She also let him pawn  her furniture to get the $ 500 he needed to start the Negro magazine. It is natural that difficulties and failures followed john closely until he become very successful. He always keeps his mother's words in mind:\" Son, failure is not in your vocabulary!\" Now John H.

For this, there are many reasons but most of them stem from not being able to properly understand their teens. It is a dangerous gap because parents will have to communicate with their teens about a wide variety of issues during the most important years of their lives. Thus, parents must know how to communicate openly and honestly with their teens. Here are a few tips to make communication easier between parents and teenagers. 1. Try not to talk down to your teens. Make them feel as if their views really matter, which not only helps your discussions with your teen but bring you closer to him. 2. Imagine what it would be like to be a teen. Try to remember some of the negative feelings you experienced as a teenager and apply it to your teen's situation. 3. Never make negative remarks to your teen about what she has said or done. 4. Remember how much courage it would have taken for your teen to come and talk to you about his personal issues. So listen respectfully. 5. Don't ignore your teen's feelings because it is usually a cry for help. For instance, if your teen is unusually angry, it may be time to spend a bit of quality time with your teen to determine what is wrong and where he is coming from. It is, therefore, necessary for parents to strive to keep lines of communication open at all times with their teens. Try to remember what it was like to be a teenager and how vulnerable you felt. Then you will be well on your way to help your teen communicate more openly and honestly. When your son comes to you for help, you should NOT   _  .",

When it became lighter, I decided to get my car which was parked at my office three streets away. My friends argued that I shouldn't go, mainly because I was seven months pregnant   then. I promised that I'd be very careful. One of them wanted to come with me but I asked her to stay with another friend who needed help with her baby. I walked out of the hotel and started making my way to the car. At the crossing, a black car stopped and a man came out with an umbrella. Before I knew what was happening, he walked right through me and told me he'd escort   me. Although I refused, he insisted   that he would. During our walk, he kept telling me to walk slower, as the ground was wet. When we got to the car-park, I thanked him and he went away. I did not get his name and can hardly recognize   him now. Did he stop for me? I'll never know. So how did I pay it forward? I was at home when I noticed two Indian workers walking in the heavy rain. They were probably on their way to the working place near my home. _  They were surprised by my action. They were very grateful to me, probably wondered why a stranger was offering such kindness.

Now there is no forest left, though there are still some small areas covered with trees. We call these woods. Elephants, tigers and many other animals were living in the thick forest. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the animals began to die out. Early farmers grew rice and kept pigs and chickens in the valleys. They cut down the trees and burnt them. They needed fire to keep themselves warm in winter, to cook their food and to keep away the dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough food for them. Many other animals soon died in the same way. You might think that there are no longer any animals in Hong Kong except in 2005. But there are still about 36 different animals living there. One of the most interesting of Hong Kong's animals is the barking deer. These are beautiful little animals with a rich brown coat and a white patch under the tail. They look like deer but they are much smaller. They are less than two feet high. They make a noise rather like a dog barking. In Hong Kong the barking deer has only a real enemy---- men. People hunt these little animals though it is illegal, There are now not many barking deer left. So it is important for people to protect wild animals.

Every year, millions of people are murdered by these two killers. And to date, doctors have not found an effective way to cure them. But if the gene technology is applied, not only these two diseases can be cured completely, bringing happiness and more living days to the patients, but also the great amount of money people spend on curing their diseases can be saved, therefore it benefits the economy as well. In addition, human life span  can be prolonged. www.zxxk.com Gene technology can help people to give birth to healthy and clever children. Some families, with the English imperial family being a good example, have hereditary  diseases. This means their children will for sure have the family disease, which is a great trouble for these families. In the past, doctors could do nothing about hereditary diseases. But gene technology can solve this problem perfectly. The scientist just need to find the wrong gene and correct it, and a healthy child will be born. Some people are worrying that the gene research can be used to manufacture human beings in large quantities. In the past few years, scientists have succeeded in cloning a sheep, therefore these people predict that human babies would soon be cloned.

        "question": "LONDON--Archaeologists have discovered a smaller prehistoric  site near Britain's famous circle of standing stones at Stonehenge. Researchers have named the site \"Bluehenge\" after the color of the 27 Welsh stones that were laid to make up a path. The stones have disappeared, but the path of holes remains. The new circle, unearthed over the summer by researchers from Sheffield University, represents an important find, researchers said Saturday. The site is about a mile away from Stonehenge. Bluehenge, about 80 miles southwest of London, is believed to date back to about the time Stonehenge was built, about 5,000 years ago. Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University said he believed the path and stonehenge itself were linked to rituals  of life and death. Mike Parker suggested that the ancient funerary rituals began at a different circle site known as \"Wood-henge\", which represented the world of the living. The bodies of the dead were then brought down the River Avon to Bluehenge, which represented death, and were finally carried along a ceremonial route known as the Avenue to Stonehenge. Bournemouth University Professor Tim Darvill, an expert on Stonehenge, told Britain's Dail Mail that Bluehenge \"adds to the richness\" of the ancient site's story. \"This henge is very important because it forms part of the picture of ceremonial monuments in the area and puts Stonehenge into context,\" Darvill was quoted  as saying. \"It's no longer Stonehenge standing alone, but it has to be seen in context with the landscape.\" Who believed the Stonehenge is related to ancient ritual of death?",

I knew this would be a challenge but I didn't realize how difficult it was until my classes in the high school began. I got on well with other girls. After school, I often had ice cream with them first instead of finishing my homework before it was time to hand it in. I always finished it the next day between classes. I knew it wasn't very good and the grades that I get showed I was not hard-working enough. I realized that I needed to find some kind of balance. So I created a timetable that would divide my time between studying and relaxing. It was a good idea but I was only able to follow it for a few days because it made me under too much pressure. Later, I tried another plan. Each week I listed everything that I had to get done during the week and the time by which I had to get it done. Then under the things I had to do, I made another list of things that I could do if I had time. It worked really well. Ever since I have never missed any important things. At the same time, I enjoyed my spare time a lot. Planning my time has been challenging, but I continue to do it. I'm glad that I've learned to balance things and it has helped prepare for what is coming after graduation. Why did the writer follow the first timetable only for a few days?",

        "question": "Jiang Nan, a full-time mother in Beijing, keeps a dozen or so cloth bags at home, carefully selecting one or two before heading out to get groceries. \"Most of them were giveaways from advertising marketing campaigns, but others had been handed out in the street by various environmental protection organizations,\" she explained. Since June 2008 China has forbidden the production, sale and usage of plastic bags thinner than 0.025 millimeter  , and retailers   are not allowed to provide free plastic bags to their customers, no matter how thick they are. Many Chinese consumers like Jiang have learned to refuse plastic bags whenever possible in their shopping. \"A plastic bag may only cost a few jiao, but it's more about how bad they are for the environment,\" Jiang said. The plastic ban is for the most part well carried out in big cities, and has been obviously effective in reducing white waste. On the first anniversary of the plastic ban Global Village of Beijing, an NGO environmental organization, shows that during the year of the ban the consumption of plastic bags fell by about 40 billion pieces in chain supermarkets alone, saving more than 1.2 million tons of petrol. However, enforcement   shows rather less muscle in smaller cities, towns and countryside. In a remote town like Lichuan, the awareness of environmental protection is not as strong as that in big cities. Street vendors   worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them for plastic bags. Seeing no significance in the issue, local government often turn a blind eye to banned bag trade in the market. There are still those who don't have an interest in living green. Cui Lin, another Beijinger, often forgets to bring a cloth bag when shopping, and has to buy plastic bags. \"Anyway I think plastic bags are neater and cleaner, and I don't mind paying a couple more jiao,\" he shrugged. Mrs Yu, a vegetable vendor in Lichuan County, Jiangxi Province, recalled that before plastic bags became popular in the early 1990s, Chinese people always carried a bamboo basket when they visited the market. \"Plastic bags are more convenient,\" she comments, and her view might be that of the tens of millions of people in the nation who still _ plastic bags, paid or free. This is suggested by her trade where piles of plastic bags are still passed out every day. Which is NOT the reason why some people still use plastic bags when shopping?",

It will be a few months before we have good medicine for bird flu.But that doesn't mean you can't do anything to prevent it now. So far, all the people who have caught bird flu have been those who touched sick chickens or their droppings . So it is a good idea for people to stay away from live chickens. \"People used to go to the markets to buy live chickens to eat, but now they have to change that habit,\" said Peter, an expert from World Health Organization. But if you do touch a sick bird, remember to wash your hands carefully with soap right away. Experts also say having good habits and a healthy body will help keep you safe from bird flu. For example, don't buy or eat birds that have not been checked. Don't eat anything that has touched raw meat. Also don't forget to open your windows often and exercise regularly. Getting enough sleep is also very important for fighting illness .If you feel sick, see a doctor right away.At present, no one in Shanghai has bird flu.

Five hundred years ago,news of important happenings--battles lost and won,kings or rulers overthrown  or killed--took months and even years to travel from one country to another. The news passed by word of mouth and was never accurate. Today we can read in our newspapers of important events that occur in far away countries on the same day they happen.   Apart from supplying news from all over the world,newspapers give us a lot of other useful information. There are weather reports, radio, television and film guides, book reviews, stories, and of course, advertisements. The bigger ones are put in by large companies to bring attention to their products. They pay the newspapers thousands of dollars for the advertising space, but it is worth the money, for news of their products goes into almost every home in the country. For those who produce newspapers, advertisements are also very important. Money earned from advertisements makes it possible for them to sell their newspapers at a low price and still make a profit.

        "question": "Have you taken inventory of the stress in your life? Stress can come from work. It can come from family. It can come from the places we live and the lifestyles we choose. In a recent survey, 60 percent of respondents said the city in which they live is noisier now than five years ago. The other 40 percent? They didn't hear the question. How much stress do you feel? Though not all stress should be avoided, too much pressure can cause lasting harm in practically every area of your life. The solution is to take control. Robert Reich did just that. As Secretary of Labor in the Clinton cabinet ,Robert B. Reich, told of his decision to resign from the stressful job. He said,\"I have the best job I've ever had and probably ever will. No topping it.\"It was true. He seemed to love his job. But he added, \"I also have the best family I'll ever have, and I can't get enough of them.\"And there was the problem --too much of a good thing. He could not give himself to his family and to this particular career at the same time. So Reich said,\"I had to choose, I told the boss I'll be leaving, and explained why.\" His boss, of course, was the president of the United States. And the country took notice. Some people were surprised. Here was a high government official who made a decision to step out of an important and powerful position in order to spend more time at home. He took control. That is the first step to free ourselves from unnecessary stress: take control. Make the hard decision. It may be a decision for less money, a smaller home, a new location, a different job, less prestige ,or a simpler lifestyle. But one thing I believe: it will be a decision you will never regret.

Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again. Unfortunately, Ubayd' s experience is not unusual. Whether it's kids copying class -mates' answers during tests or friends sharing homework, cheating happens in schools every day. Experts say the behavior starts in the lower grades. Surveys show that one in three elementary students admits to cheating. Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts, has had classmates ask to copy his homework. \"I wouldn't want to just tell them the answers,\" he says. So instead, he explains the task and encourages his classmates to do it themselves. But many kids find it hard to say no. \"l hear from kids all the time, ' I can' t say no to a friend,'\" says Eric Anderman, a professor at The Ohio State University who studies cheating in school. He says it' s important to say no from the start. \"Then you _ , and the other kid gets the message,\" he says. Plus, he points out, \"a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework.\" The kids doing the copying may feel they need to cheat to be accepted by other kids. And some students may cheat simply because others do. \"If you' re in an atmosphere where cheating is common, you may think that if you don' t cheat, you' re at a disadvantage,\" says Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. But Josephson says students shouldn't think that way. \"There are a lot of things kids do,\" he says. \"You have to decide what kind of person you' re going to be.\" When school becomes too challenging, Anderman suggests going to the teacher rather than relying on the work of others. \"It' s good to ask for help,\" he says.

        "question": "Emotional eating is when people use food as a way to deal with feelings instead of to satisfy hunger. We've all been there, finishing a whole bag of chips out of boredom or eating cookie after cookie while  _ for a big test. But when done a lot -- especially without realizing it -- emotional eating can affect weight, health, and overall well-being. Not many of us make the connection between eating and our feelings. But understanding what drives emotional eating can help people take steps to change it. One of the biggest myths about emotional eating is that it's prompted by negative feelings. Yes, people often turn to food when they're stressed out, lonely, sad, anxious, or bored. But emotional eating can be linked to positive feelings too, like the romance of sharing dessert on Valentine's Day or the celebration of a holiday feast. Sometimes emotional eating is tied to major life events, like a death or a divorce. More often, though, it's the countless little daily stresses that cause someone to seek comfort or distraction in food. Emotional eating patterns can be learned: A child who is given candy after a big achievement may grow up using candy as a reward for a job well done. A kid who is given cookies as a way to stop crying may learn to link cookies with comfort. We're all emotional eaters to some extent. But for some people, emotional eating can be a real problem, causing serious weight gain or cycles of binging and purging. The trouble with emotional eating (apart from the health issues) is that once the pleasure of eating is gone, the feelings that cause it remain. And you often may feel worse about eating the amount or type of food you did. That's why it helps to know the differences between physical hunger and emotional hunger. Next time you reach for a snack, check in and see which type of hunger is driving it. Which of the following is NOT true about emotional eating?",

The water leaked through directly above Johnson, dropping steadily onto his bald head. Angry, he called Wright.\"Frank,\"he said,\"you built this beautiful house for me and we enjoy it very much. But ... the roof leaks, and right now I'm with some distinguished guests and it's leaking right on top of my head.\"There was a pause on the line, and Frank replied,\"Well, why don't you move your chair?\" Just when we'd like to have everything perfect in our lives, the roof springs a leak into even the best constructed and waterproof lives. Leaks happen. We have a choice, we can sit under the leak and complain, or we can regain our joy by moving our chair -- changing our perspective. Now, some will point out that the reason they have no joy in their lives is that they don't have a reason to be joyful. They have a lot of leaks in their roof. Life seems like it's fallen apart. They aren't satisfied with their job, if they even have one. Their family has problems. Their health isn't good. Their car is under repair. They just can't see a\"reason\"for being joyful. It's hard to be joyful when life is going against you. It's hard to be joyful when you're struggling with troubles, or defeated by pain, or unsure of your future. But there's a problem with that approach to life. If we wait till everything turns out the way we want them to in our lives or we're not going to be joyful until all the leaks are repaired in the roof of our lives...THEN we're never going to experience joy. There's an alternative. You don't have to wait until you're happy with your life. Deep spiritual joy in your life will always bring you happiness. But the pursuit of happiness won't always bring you joy. People have a hard time understanding the difference. Worldly   happiness almost always relies on some situation or event to make us feel good. If something good happens, we'll feel good, but if something bad happens, we won't. By contrast, spiritual joy doesn't depend on present situation. In fact, spiritual joy can often exist despite our circumstances. Don't let other people steal your joy. If the roof is leaking and you can't get someone to fix it right away, move your chair. Change your perspective. Lay hold of joy and take control of your circumstances, rather than swinging with your emotions and continuing to look for happiness. When we are faced with\"leaks\", we should try to    .",

The World Health Organization (WHO) is worried that 1.1 billion children and young people are damaging their hearing by listening to loud music. Nearly half the young people in developed countries may lose their hearing because of the \"unsafe use\" of music players, including smartphones. Loud music in nightclubs, parties and at sports also make it worse. The WHO advises young people to listen to music for just one hour a day. Dr. Etienne Krug told BBC: \"What we're trying to do is to draw people's attention to a problem that is not talked about enough.\" He said it's easy to solve this problem. Dr. Krug said keeping the music down and limiting   the listening time to less than one hour a day would save a lot of people's hearing. However, he also said, \"Even an hour can be too much if the music is too loud.\" Ralph Holme, a researcher, explained how loud noise can damage ears. He said: \"Loud sounds damage your hearing by killing off thousands of little hair cells  in the inner ear. The cells can tell different sounds through vibration . But they are very _ --they get damaged easily and even die if they vibrate too much because of loud sounds for too long.\" He warned: \"The bigger problem is they don't grow back and the ear can no longer get sound.\" No one wants to lose their hearing!

Without the disturbance of judgment or the desire to comfort her,I stayed totally quiet while she talked. Eventually Lydia's depression eased and we said our goodbyes.

But after I had my own venting    experience with another friend later that evening,I realized that my focused silence had some value. In fact,most relationship experts agree that talk is cheap;it's listening that's rare and valuable It allows you not only to hear what the other person is saying,but also to have a clear understanding of her thoughts and feelings. And for the speaker,that level of understanding translates into concern and respect. Unfortunately,listening isn't as easy as it sounds. Thanks  to  schedules  filled  with  family and work,multitasking has become a barrier   to listening. My tiredness may have been the only thing stopping me from folding  laundry or checking my email while Lydia talked that afternoon. Another barrier to listening is our listening system:Most of us take in only about half of what's being said during a conversation,according to the International Listening Association. Research shows that we speak at 125 to 150 words per minute,yet think at 500 words a minute. Therefore,because we think much more quickly than we  speak,it is easy for us to lose our concentration when  listening to speakers. While it can be hard to focus at times,it's a skill worth developing. With a little practice  (employing some techniques),you can become a better listener. Why didn't the author give any advice to Lydia that afternoon?",

        "question": "Your teenage daughter is supposed to be doing homework, but you catch her chatting online. She tells you that she's talking about the math test tomorrow. Before your eyes start rolling, listen up: teens are using social networking sites for more than just gossip, according to a new study by the National School Boards Association. The students who took part in the online survey, aged 9 to 17, said they spent almost as much time on social networking online as they did watching television. And it is what these kids are talking about online that is causing such a cheer: education. Of the students who took part in the study 60 percent reported that some of the most popular social networking topics were college planning, learning outside of school, careers, and schoolwork. They also reported posting writing and art projects that might have nothing to do with schoolwork. Ann Flynn, director of education technology for the National School Boards Association, says   social networking tools into educational   is the way forward. Flynn says a school in Cleveland, Ohio is posting students' book reports on a blog for students of their own ages, parents and other teachers to read and comment on. \"If someone reacts other than the teacher, a child is much more likely to take an assignment seriously,\" Flynn says. Not only students but also parents can benefit. Now parents can go online and know what the class is doing. So, next time your child says her blog is educational, get curious, sit down and check out the blog with her. You might just learn something new yourself.

I knew at once that I had to be strong. \"Class,\" I said as loudly as I could. \"I may be blind. But I am not foolish. Take those naughty smiles off your faces, and stop talking, please!\" Of course, I could not see their faces; I just guessed that some of them were smiling. The class were quiet. They were very surprised. I knew that I had done the right thing. As the days went by, the students had more surprises. I could smell when the children were eating sweets. I could easily hear combs going through hair, students passing messages, and so on. Once I found a girl passing a message to a friend. I took the message to the teachers' room. A teacher read it to me. On one side it said, \"Do you think she can see?\" on the other it said, \"I think so. She always knows what we're doing.\" Soon the students stopped being naughty, and started to work hard.

        "question": "If you want to avoid making impulse   and unnecessary purchases,then just keep your hands away from tempting products. According to new research,individuals who touch possible items in stores are more likely to have an increased desire to purchase them than those who keep their hands off the products. Suzanne Shu and Joann Peck,marketing professors at the University of Wisconsin's business school conducted studies on the connection between touch and feelings of ownership and the effect of perceived ownership on the value placed on an object. For one of the experiments,the experts placed two products,a Slinky toy and a coffee mug in front of the volunteers who were undergraduate students.  About half of the participants were allowed to touch the products,while the other half were asked not to touch them. The volunteers then were asked to express their sense of ownership of the products and to report how much money they were willing to pay for each. The results showed that those students who were allowed to touch the objects,reported significant increased levels of perceived ownership. They also expressed a desire to pay more money to obtain the products.   The investigators also discovered that a sense of very pleasant feelings when touching products,determined how much money consumers were willing to pay.  However,if the object did not feel pleasant to the touch,it significantly decreased the amount the buyers were willing to pay.   Researchers said that many stores have already followed the right path. But what can be done while shopping online,when touching of an item is not possible? In this case,the experts say,just picturing in mind that they are touching it and then owning it,will cause greater feelings of ownership,and thus the consumers will be more likely to make a purchase.   When you touch an object,you immediately feel some kind of a connection to it,according to the researchers.  That connection stirs up an emotional reaction.  And that emotion can make people buy something they would never even consider buying if they had not touched it. The author develops the text mainly by  _  .",

The announcement came as a result of long lasting heavy smog in Beijing and the neighboring Tianjin and  Hebei province for the better part of a week. The next step is to further optimize  the country's industry, and energy structure and cut back one missions  of air pollutants, Chen said. Authorities will go on cutting back on outdated factories this year, shut down l,000 small coal mines, improve the quality of coal on the market, guarantee stable supply of natural gas, and promote the use of clean energy and energy-saving buildings. Chen said efforts will also be made to improve the evaluation of governments' carrying out of air pollution control measures, deepen regional  cooperation, step up technological research and sharpen laws and regulations in the field, to make polluters nay the \"unaffordable price\". Chen said environmental authorities would \"bring new tools introduced in the law into full play, conduct more secret inspections and seek heavier punishment for companies guilty of illegal emissions and those which deliberately change pollution data. \" Government officials who overlook their duties or abuse their power will be examined in line with law, he said.

Don't suppose that drivers will jam on their brakes when you hit the crosswalk signals. Some provinces, such as Alberta, issue  a ticket if you don't give drivers enough time to brake. Cross quickly.

        "question": "She's not afraid of anything. Snakes? No problem. Walking alone in the dark? Easy. We're not talking about a superhero here -- SM is a 44-year-old mother.  And she's fearless because she happens to be missing part of her brain: the amygdala . Shaped like a pair of almonds sitting in the middle of your brain, the amygdala helps control fear and anxiety. A rare condition called Urbach-Wiethe disease left SM without her amygdala, and seems to have completely erased her sense of fear. To try to understand how the amygdala works, a team of researchers made their efforts to scare SM. They showed her horror movies and took her to the Waverly Hills Sanatorium Haunted House in Kentucky. She pushed out one of the monsters  and laughed. SM said she didn't like snakes, but at a pet store full of poisonous creatures, she kept asking to touch them. When asked to rate her feelings, SM reported feeling surprised or disgusted, but never fearful. \"She tends to approach everything she should be avoiding,\" says Justin Feinstein of the  University of Iowa. This means the amygdala could control deeper urges to approach or avoid danger. Other scientists have a different opinion, though.  \"I don't believe you can make a general statement about what the amygdala does by a single case study,\" Elizabeth Phelps said. In 2002, Phelps published a study on a similar patient with amygdala damage who still showed fear. It may sound like fun to be totally fearless, but we get scared for a good reason. \"The nature of fear is survival and the amygdala helps us stay alive by avoiding situations, people, or objects that put our life in danger,\" Feinstein said. SM was once followed in a park after dark by a man with a knife, and she simply walked away. \"It is quite remarkable that she is still alive,\" said Feinstein.

        "question": "For millions of years, sharks have been the kings of the oceans, the top of the food chain. But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins  to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back.     Shark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. The competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season.     \"I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing   them, and very rarely killing them and eating them,\" he said. \"If I thought killing one shark was endangering   the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow.\"   That is exactly what marine biologists like Luke Tipple want to happen. \"I believe that they should just stop it. In fact, we don't need to be targeting, in any way, any of these threatened populations,\" he said. Up to 73 million sharks are killed annually, and many species are at risk of extinction  .

For example, when I lecture  , I often use my hands to emphasize   points or point to something on the blackboard. Some people use them more than others. The victory   sign, the OK sign, the goodbye wave and the blowing of a kiss are all popular gestures in America. It is important to recognize, however, that most gestures are not universally recognized. For example, although the OK gesture means acceptance in prefix = st1 /America, it has other meanings in other cultures. InFranceit means worthlessness. And in Greece, it is considered obscene  .      There are some sex differences in nonverbal behavior. In American culture, men tend to sit or stand with legs apart and hands outward, while women tend to keep legs together and hands at their sides. Women are also better than men at understanding nonverbal gestures.      A nonverbal behaviour is to have the tongue just slightly protruding   from the mouth. A study showed that people were less willing to approach others who had their tongues showing. Perhaps this is why people often tend to avoid individuals with bad nonverbal behaviours.

Posting too much personal information for those millions of cyber eyes to see can cause some big problems and can even invite a threat to your life.

        "question": "We all know that eating junk food can make us fat. However, a new study suggests that it can do more than that - it can also make us lazy, reported CBS News. In the study, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, US divided 32 female rats into two groups. The first group was fed a diet of healthy food such as corn and fish, while the second was given a diet of highly processed   food rich in sugar, namely \"junk food\". Within three months, the rats in the second group were already much fatter than those on the healthy diet. And when researchers trained the rats to do simple tasks, they found even more differences between the two groups rather than weight. During the task - pushing a lever   to receive a reward of sugar water - the rats on the junk food diet were found to be less willing to move, and they took longer breaks between each push than the lean rats did. \"It is as if the rat is thinking 'This is too much work',\" Aaron Blaisdell, leader of the study, told the Los Angeles Times. But what about the possibility that the fat rats were less passionate about getting sugar water because they were already eating lots of sugar in their daily diet? That's why researchers repeated the tests by rewarding fat rats with plain water when they were extremely thirsty. However, the results came out just the same. According to researchers, these differences suggest that junk food changed the chemistry in the rats' brains. The experiment didn't end _ . After six months, the rats' diets were switched, and the overweight rats were given a healthy diet for nine days. However, this change didn't help reduce their weight or improve their ability to perform tasks, which means the effects of their junk food diet persisted  . \"There's no quick fix,\" said Blaisdell. For a long time, we've believed that people become fat because they are lazy. But this study has proven the opposite to be true as well, which indicates that laziness and obesity are a \"vicious cycle  \".

Therefore, this development needs to be different from past development, which polluted the environment and wasted natural resources. One possible solution to this problem now being discussed is sustainable development. It focuses on preserving the environment and natural resources. It is all about creating better health care, education, housing and improved standard of living for everyone. This is a simple idea, but one that is hard to put into practice. However, it is something that we must do, because without sustainable development our future and the lives of our children and our grandchildren will be in danger. Nearly everything we do in our modern lives requires the use of the Earth's natural resources. These natural resources provide the energy for many important things. The list is almost endless. For all these things, we mostly depend on fuels such as coal, gas and oil to produce energy. We are now consuming these fuels at a much higher rate than they are being produced. On top of this, burning these fuels produces carbon dioxide, which is harmful to the environment. This is why many people are pushing for the use of alternative energy sources. Alternative energy sources can be used without running out. Some examples of the alternatives are solar energy, wind energy and hydroelectricity. As people are becoming more aware of the need to protect the environment, these types of energy are becoming more and more popular. In many parts of the world, tentative  steps are being taken to introduce these forms of alternative energy. For example, some people in Nigeria are training to use solar power, and in Costa Rica, people are now using hydroelectricity to provide power for their small villages. The introduction of programmes like these will hopefully help end the systematic destruction of the environment and see alternative energy promoted around the world.

In 1930, Neumann visited Princeton University for a year and then became a professor there.His first book was published in 1932.In 1933, the Institute for Advanced Study was formed, and he became one of the 6 full-time people in the School of Mathematics (Einstein was one of the others).

        "question": "The next time you look up at the sky and see a cloud that looks like Mickey Mouse or your favorite fruit, look again. It may not be a cloud, but a Flogo -- a logo that flies. It's a new form of advertising in the sky that's never been used before. It's a different way to market your products, logos, and events. These funny logos are made with soap bubbles   mixed with a little helium gas   ,which makes them lighter than air and float in the sky. Special machines are used to make these new funny Flogos. The machine, which can be rented for $ 2,500 a day, can make a Flogo every 15-25 seconds. Flogos can fly much higher or lower if needed. They can last from a few minutes to an hour anywhere in the sky, depending on the weather conditions. Though they can fly up to 20, 000 feet, they usually float around at 300- 500 feet. Flogos are only white now, but people hope to have more colorful Flogos in the near future. Flogos are Green, 100% environmentally safe, because the soap used to make the Flogo comes from plants and leaves. So this fun way of advertising is healthy and good for the environment.

        "question": "The H1Nl virus has been spreading world-wide,it is important for us to know how to control it.Please pay attention to the following points: 1.Don't touch your face.Above all,keep your hands away from your eyes,mouth and nose,all of which serve pathways  for the viruses  to enter your body. 2.Wash your hands.If you have to touch your face,wash your hands,getting under the fingernails for 20 to 30 seconds with hot soap and water before.Soaps with surfactants  can deal with flu viruses. 3.Cover your nose and mouth.When someone sneezes or coughs,liquid  drops with flu viruses as far as three feet through the air and land on your nose and mouth,so it's best to keep at least an arm's length distance when talking to someone who shows signs of infection .In order to protect others,cover your mouth and nose with a tissue  when you cough or sneeze,and clean your hands afterward.Viruses can live for hours,or even longer when on the skin or other surfaces such as keyboards. 4.Consider buying a mask in case you need it in the future.Some research suggests that masks reduce the risk of getting the flu viruses by as much as 80%.But it also suggests that if you don't wash hands,the mask doesn't work well.So wash your hands and use the mask,especially wearing face masks in crowded places is also useful. ,.

Adam Kerr, 12, from Armagh, Northern Ireland, also helps his mother care for his younger brother Brian, 9, who suffers from the genetic disease Fanconi's anaemia  . But it is not the first hardship that has affected young Adam. When he was just six, he donated his own bone marrow to his younger sister Helen who suffered from a rare blood disorder. Sadly she developed complications and died a few months after the operation in 2005. Adam found it very difficult to be happy after Helen's death. So he decided to start raising money in memory of Helen to help local poor children and families with bereavement  . Overall he has raised PS10,000 and he has no intentions of giving up. He organised a Fun Day to provide the money for a brother and sister from Northern Ireland to visit their sick brother having a bone marrow transplant in a London hospital. He received his award and a cheque forPS2,000 at an \"Oscar's style\" ceremony in London. Ms Phillips said: \"Adam is an incredible young man. In his relatively short life he has faced real sadness and bad luck and yet he works tirelessly to make life better for others.\" The Awards were sponsored by the charity 4Children and Take a Break Magazine. Anne Longfield OBE, Chief Executive of 4Children said:\"It's an honour to recognise Adam's devotion and self-sacrifice, and his bravery shows there is always reason for hope and optimism. There is so much unrecognized goodwill out there of people who do so much for others, and the inspiring winners of the Family Heroes Awards remind us how important it is for us all to do our best to make a difference in the lives of others.\" Why does Adam raise money for charity?",

        "question": "In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \"gentleman in white\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel.     When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization.     Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross. Why did Henry Dunant go to the battlefield?",

        "question": "When Nick Pasqua hits his bedroom after school, he's tired. The 14-year-old high school freshman from New Rochele, New York, plays computer video games online for a couple of hours, pausing only to instant-message his friends, check his blog or download a new song to his IPOD. When his cell phone vibrates , he scans the text message and fires back a reply. \"We're leagues behind,\" sighs Nick's mom, Kimberly Pasqua, 45. And many parents like her are feeling increasingly out of step with their children. The technology gap between parents and kids is widening, says Amenda Lenhart, senior research specialist for Internet & American Life Project, a research group that explores the impact of the Internet on children and families. In a series of reports released last year, researchers found that 87 percent of the prefix = st1 /United States' kids aged 12 to 17 use the Internet, compared to only 66 percent of adults. Half of those teens go online daily. Eighty-one percent play games online and 75 percent use instant-messaging. Nearly half(45 percent) have a cell phone. One out of five has a blog. Why are children increasing past their parents? Because today's kids learn to use computers by playing and think technology is fun, says Lenhart. But adults generally view computers as mere tools for work , not toys. Despite this difference, most parents realize that computers, cell phones and the like are fixtures  in their children's lives. With that acceptance comes worry about what makes appropriate usage and more important, what's safe. Experts say the best way to keep up is to learn the technology for yourself. Visit blogs. Send some instant and text messages. Download music. \"This stuff may never be as necessary to your life as it is to your kids,\" says Susannah Stern, assistant professor in the Communications Department at UniversityofSan Diego, \"but you won't get their respect about online issues if you don't know what they're talking about.\" Children can be great teachers, so let them show you the ropes. \"It's empowering for them to share their knowledge,\" says Stern.

But have you ever thought about how to take care of four to twelve old people when you grow up and get married? This could be a problem for most Chinese youths as China is entering a new stage of an aging society. An aging society refers to one where 10 percent or more of its population is over 60. By the end of 2007, Chinese over 60 years old have made up 11.7 percent of the nation's total population. \"China is getting old before becoming rich,\"said Cai Chuang, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The population increase that has powered Chinese growth for three decades will give way over the next ten years to a rapid aging of the society. This will lead to weaker economic growth, because of a lack of labor resources. As a result of the family planning policy, it is expected that the country's total working population will decrease after 2015. China is not the only country getting old. More that 60 countries have become aging societies and one in three people in the European Union is a senior citizen. However, experts said that China doesn't have a highly developed social security network to support the old. Social security is an insurance program protecting those in need, including the old, the disabled and others. What does Cai Chuang mean by saying\"China is getting old before becoming rich.\"?",

However, the findings should not stop us from keeping fit. Experts believe that willpower  is like a muscle, and needs to be exercised to help one avoid the temptation  spending a night on the couch instead. Kathleen Martin-Ginis, a professor of kinesiology-the science of movement--who led the study, says everyone has a limited amount of willpower, and that it will be reduced by stress. Miss Martin-Ginis, of Canada's McMaster University, explains,\" Cognitive  tasks, as well as tasks such as regulating one's emotions, can reduce one's capacity to force oneself to exercise. \" Her team of scientists performed a so-called \"Stroop\" test on volunteers to reach their conclusions. The experiment involved showing participants words associated with color1s but printed in different color1s-for example, the word \"blue\" written in red ink Participants were divided into two groups. One group was asked to name the color1 of the ink, instead to say the printed word, while the other wasn't Martin-Girus says, \"After we used this cognitive task to use up their self-regulatory capacity, the participants didn't exercise as hard as those who had not performed the task \" The more people concentrated on the cognitive task, the more likely they were to skip exercise sessions  over the next eight week You only have so much willpower. However, there are ways to strengthen willpower. The study found the listening to music before going to the gym can help, as well as making a commitment to work out with friends. It also concluded that willpower can be stretched by constant cake, or forcing oneself to study an extra hour each night Martin- Ginis adds,\" There are strategies people can use to help revitalize  themselves after they've used up their self-regulation Willpower is like a muscle: it needs to be used to stay strong. \" According to the experts, human willpower  _  .",

One day Johnny heard a mother saying to her son \"Come on, my boy, get up and stop crying. You are behaving like Johnny Jones.\" That made Johnny feel very ashamed. But he was sure that he would prefer to be known as a good boy rather than a fool. Worried, he spoke to his father about all this, though he was afraid that maybe he would be laughed at for having such worries. His father, far from laughing at Johnny, told him that a teacher had taught him a secret trick to turn him into the toughest boy off all. \"Eat a candy less, study a minute more, and count to five before crying.\" Johnny asked, \"Just that? \" \"Yes, just that,\" said his father, \"It's very simple, but I warn you that it won't be easy.\" Johnny was happy like a bird, ready to follow the advice. He went to see his mother, and she noticed how happy he was when she offered him candies. \"One candy less\", thought Johnny, so he only took one. That afternoon he had another chance to put it into practice by studying one minute more. The result was that he missed the first minute of his favorite program! But having achieved this gave him a great feeling of satisfaction. The same happened when he ran up against the corner of the kitchen table.

        "question": "A good modern newspaper is an extraordinary piece of reading. It is unusual for what it contains: the news from local crime to international politics, from sports to business to fashion to science, and the comments and special features as well, from editorial page to feature articles, from interviews to criticism of books, art, theatre, and music. A newspaper is even more unusual for the way one reads it never completely, never straight through, but always by jumping from here to there, in and out, glancing at one piece, reading another article all the way through, reading just a few paragraphs of the next. A good modern newspaper offers a variety to attract many different readers, but far more than any one reader is interested in. What brings this variety together in one place is its _ , that is, its immediate relation to what is happening in your world and your locality now. But this immediacy and the speed of production that goes with it also mean that much of what appears in a newspaper has no more than temporary value. For all these reasons, no two people really read the same paper: what each person does is to put together, out of the pages of that day's paper, his own selection and order, his own newspaper. For all these reasons, reading newspapers efficiently which means getting what you want from them without missing things you need but without wasting time, demands skill and self-awareness  as you change and apply the techniques of reading.

Fine art treasures from many countries are kept in an art museum called the Louvre   in Paris, France. The works of art have been collected by the people of France over many centuries. It is the biggest art museum in the world. The Louvre has not always been a museum. The first building was a fort. In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew. By 1350, the castle no longer needed a fort. The Louvre became a palace home for French kings and queens. During times of peace, new treasures were brought in. During the days of war, many treasures were stolen, and the buildings were damaged. When Francis I became king of France in 1515, he brought in many artists from other countries. One of the artists was Lenardo da Vinci from Italy. Da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" is the best known painting in the museum today. In 1793, the Louvre became a public museum. It is a place where art treasures are kept for everyone to enjoy. Every year millions of people from all over the world come to the Louvre to see the masterpieces.

Here are some of the ways in which we work to prevent hunger in the future: School Meals As well as directly addressing hunger, School Meals projects encourage families to keep their children in school and help them build better futures. If children aren't hungry they will concentrate on their lessons. With a solid education growing children have a better chance of finding their own way out of hunger. These projects benefit girls especially. For more information: www.wfp.org/schools meals. Food for Assets  WFP's Food for Assets projects provide the hungry with food to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. When poor farmers no longer have to worry about the next meal, they have the time and energy to build irrigation  systems that can increase production. Similarly, Food for Training projects allow the poor to devote time to learning skills that will sustain  them economically in the future. For more information: www.wfp.org/food-assets. HIV/AIDS WFP uses its food rations  to reduce the blow of HIV and AIDS. The agency distributes its rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, so they can keep providing for their families for longer and have time to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children--the next generation of food providers in developing countries. For more information: www.wfp.org/hiv-aids. Purchase for Progress WFP buys large amounts of food in developing countries. It has this purchasing power and uses it to help poor farmers contact reliable markets where they can get competitive prices for their produce. With secure markets, farmers will be encouraged to produce more and innovate .The knock-on effect is producing more food for everyone. For more information: www.wfp.ofp/purchase-progress.

However, a group of senior Chinese ladies dancing in New York's Sunset Park were recently faced with noise complaints from nearby residents. The local court even served a summons   related to a certain Ms. Wang. The news soon caused heated discussion across China, with many believing the incident to involve a cultural conflict between the East and West,while others view it as a form of discrimination against Chinese in the United States. The United States is a diverse society, and in many cases, Chinese dancers are tolerated and even appreciated. Meanwhile, the United States is a society based on the rule of law, and due to cultural differences, local regulations seem to be very different from those in China. As a result, some old Chinese ladies dancing in New York's Sunset Park found themselves caught in an embarrassing situation. Locals and immigrants from other nations view such noise as a violation of their right to enjoy _ . Calling the police is regarded as the most efficient way to solve such a problem. Before, these ladies probably did not understand local customs and rules. However, since the incident took place, they should perhaps know a little better next time and keep the noise to a minimum. People from different nations are often supposed to reach compromises, respecting and tolerating each other. Whatever your choice of entertainment, it is important not to affect other people's lives. Square dancing is only one of many activities during which people should mind their behavior. As for U.S. police practice, there might still be some room for improvement. Some were said to be rather rude, leading to the so-called \"racial discrimination,\" which is a sensitive topic in U.S. society.

That's not very different from the way our parents saw themselves. But with more two-career families and busy schedules, one thing parents today recognize more than ever is the need to set aside special time for their children. These 'nurturing moments' are changed into memories that they will treasure all their lives. Nurturing moments might be the time between our work and life,bringing your child to work with you to see what you do during the day,visiting your child's make-believe world,discussing his other school day and exploring the natural world outside your door. These times are not merely a luxury  , they're a necessity. It's during these moments that parents pass values and attitudes to their children. Over time, children pick up good habits and positive self-image. Here are a few tips for making the most of your family time together: Regularly sit down as a family to share a meal. Allow each person to describe something interesting about his or her day. Make one night a week family night. Family members take turns choosing a special activity for the evening everyone partakes in the fun. Show your children you care about their interests by having them teach you about their activity or hobby. Nurturing healthy children involves body, mind and spirit. The little things you do to your care are the building blocks for confidence, self-esteem and a healthy outlook. By giving your children these tools, you prepare them for life.

It was such a success that people decided to do more. There are some interesting and special rules of the event. For example, players(male or female at least 16 years old) must have been homeless at some time after the previous year's World Cup or make their main living income by selling newspapers in the street or be asylum  seekers . Anyone can take part, regardless of his or her abilities. There are at most 4 players per team to compete in the field. Games are 14 minutes long.

        "question": "Have you wondered why you have two eyes and why they are set close together on the front of your face? The reasons are simple and important to the way you see the rest of your world. Your eyes are like two small cameras. A camera catches an image of an object and records it on film.Similarly,when you look at something,each eye takes in what it sees and sends this image to the back of the eyeball.Because your eyes are set close together,they view the world from about the same height but from slightly different angles. Working as a team, the eyes send the images to your brain, which puts them together into a single, centered image. Seeing in stereo means seeing with two eyes working together,which is called stereoscopic sight.This allows you to view the world in three dimensions,or 3-D.Seeing depth helps you to judge the distance between you and the objects you see and to adjust to the changing angle at which you see something as you move closer to or farther away from it.If images are coming from only one eye, however,only two of these dimensions-height and width-can be perceived.A world seen with one eye is thus two-dimensional,as in a photograph. Now consider why your two eyes are on the front of your face.Think of other animals with this same arrangement.They are all animals that hunt,like lions and wolves.Their eyes face directly in front of them.This provides a field of sight about 180 degrees wide,which is called binocular sight.On the other hand,animals that are hunted have eyes on the sides of the head,which provides nearly 360-degree field of sight.In order to stay alive,they need to see things coming from the sides and from behind.However,without stereoscopic sight,they have difficulty determining how far a danger is. With sight both stereoscopic and binocular,humans share with animal hunters the ability to  see from side to side and to accurately determine the distance.If you think it would be great to  have another type of sight,perhaps with hundreds of tiny eyes like many insects do,think again! Each tiny insect eye sees only a tiny part.Besides,what if you needed glasses? Be glad for the  eyesight that you have. According to the passage,an eye is like a camera because both",

        "question": "In 2003, Bethany Hamilton,13, lost her left arm to a shark attack while surfing off Kauai, Hawaii. A new film ,Soul Surfer, is based on the story of how she overcame that to achieve her dream of becoming a professional athlete. Growing up on the \"garden isle\" of Kauai, Hamilton spent every minute she could riding the waves. She was on the verge of   becoming a top competitor in professional surfing. But while she was practicing at an isolated cove  ,a four-meter-long tiger shark ripped off her left arm. Though her life was saved, nobody could imagine she would ever get back on a surfboard again. In a true test of her faith and by _ will power, Bethany did get back up on a surfboard only a month after the attack. Six months later, she was competing again. Bethany Hamilton won her first amateur surfing championship just two years after she lost her arm. She also established the \"Friends of Bethany,\" a non---profit foundation dedicated to supporting sharks attack victims. It's a story told in her autobiography, which is the basis for the film that stars teenager Anna Sophia Robb. \"I knew Bethany's story, of course, but I thought 'What an incredible role' ,\"explains Robb. \"I was so fascinated by all of the challenges. What would it be like to have your arm taken and what would go through your head and how would your faith be challenged?\" The filmmakers used special effects to digitally remove Robb' s arm .However ,no tricks were necessary for the surfing scenes because Hamilton herself did the breathtaking wave riding. Now 21, Hamilton says she hopes audiences find inspiration in the description of the sport she loves. \"Not a lot of people know that much about surfing, so I hope they're educated about it,\" Hamilton says. \"And most of all if people are going through a hard time, they could be encouraged and find inspiration to push through those hard times and see that, in my case ,so much good has come out of it.\" How does Hamilton hope people will be affected by her story?",

These tales so excited the farmer that he could hardly wait to sell his farm and go prospecting for diamonds himself. So he sold the farm and spent the rest of his life wandering the African continent, searching unsuccessfully for the shining stone that brought such high prices on the markets of the world. Finally, broke and worn out, he threw himself into a river and drowned. Meanwhile, back at the farm, the man who had bought his farm happened to be crossing a small river on the property one day when he saw something shining at the bottom of the river. He picked it up. It was a sparkling stone - a good size stone - and, admiring it, he later put it on his fireplace mantel  as an interesting curiosity. Several weeks later, a visitor admired the stone, looked closely at it, lifted it in his hand and nearly fainted. He asked the farmer if he knew what he'd found. When the farmer said no, that he thought it was just a piece of crystal, the visitor told him he had found one of the largest diamonds ever discovered. The farmer was astonished. He told the man that his small river was full of these brilliant stones, and his farmland was covered with them. Not all were as large, perhaps, as the one on his mantel, but they were sprinkled generously throughout his property. Needless to say, the farm the first farmer had sold, so that he could search for a diamond mine, turned out to be the most productive diamond mine on the entire African continent.

Homework is a major part of going to class, and it helps students grasp important concepts. Luckily, you can do a few things to make homework less painful. First, be sure you understand the assignment. Write it down in your notebook or day planner if you need to, and don't be afraid to ask questions about what is expected. It is much easier to take a minute to ask the teacher during or after class than to struggle to remember later at night! Second, use any extra time you have in school to work on your homework. Many schools have study halls that are specifically designed to allow students to study or get homework done. It is attractive to hang out with friends during study periods or unscheduled time, but the more work you can get done in school, the less you will have to do at night. Third, pace yourself. If you don't finish your homework during school, think about how much you have left and what else is going on that day, and then budget your time. Most high school students have between 1 and 3 hours of homework a night. If it is a heavy-homework day and it seems like you have got an assignment on every subject but gym and lunch, you will need to devote more time to homework schedule, especially if you are involved in sports or activities or have an after-school job.

        "question": "Are you a compulsive spender,or do you hold on to your money as long as possible? Are you a bargain hunter? Would you rather use charge accounts than pay in cash? Your answers to these questions will reflect your personality.According to psychologists,our individual money habits not only show our beliefs and values,but can also stem from past problems. Experts in psychology believe that for many people,money is an important symbol of strength and influence.Husbands who complain about their wives' spending habits may be afraid that they are losing power in their marriage.Wives,on the other hand,may waste huge amounts of money because they are angry at their husbands.In addition,many people consider money a symbol of love.They spend it on their family and friends to express love,or they buy themselves expensive presents because they need love. People can be addicted to different things --for example,alcohol,drugs,certain foods,or even television.They are compulsive in their addictions,i.e.they must satisfy these needs to feel comfortable.In the same way,according to psychologists,compulsive spenders must spend money. For people who buy on credit,furthermore,charge accounts are even more exciting than money:in other words,they feel that with credit,they can do anything.Their pleasures in spending enormous amounts are actually greater than _ they get from the things they buy. There is even a special psychology of bargain hunting.To save money,of course,most people look for sales,low prices,and discounts.Compulsive bargain hunters,however,often buy things that they don't need just because they are cheap.They want to believe that they are helping their budgets,but they are really playing an exciting game:when they can buy something for less than other people,they feel that they are winning.Most people,experts claim,have two reasons for their behavior:a good reason for the things that they do and the real reason. It is not only scientists,of course,who understand the psychology of spending habits,but also business people.Stores,companies,and advertisers use psychology to increase business:they consider people's needs for love,power,or influence,their basic values,their beliefs and opinions, etc.in their advertising and sales methods. Psychologists often use a method called \"behavior therapy \"to help individuals solve their personality problems.In the same way,they can help people who feel that they have problems with money:they give them \"assignments\" If a person buys something in every store that he enters, for instance,a therapist might teach him self discipline in this way:on the first day of his therapy, he must go into a store,stay five minutes,and then leave.On the second day,he should stay for ten minutes and try something on.On the third day,he stays for fifteen minutes,asks the salesclerk a question,but does not buy anything.Soon he will learn that nothing bad will happen to him if he doesn't buy anything,and he can solve the problem of his compulsive buying.

Rao's,the East Harlem restaurant with a history of more than l00 years,is simply the toughest restaurant to get a reservation in the US, if not the world.Michelin three-star restaurants like elBulli in Spain,often ranked the world's top restaurant,would sell out the second phone lines opened.But in the case of Rao's,the phone lines never open. There are about a dozen tables in the tiny restaurant, and each is spoken for, semi-permanently, as regulars have had their reservations for years, and when they can't use them,they often gift them to friends. The place is so small that the owners rarely have the flexibility to do favors even for people they know. Since it is always busy,there has never been a need for publicity.The last remarkable national review of the restaurant came from The New York Times more than 35 years ago.It was already tough to get a table at Rao's but reservations have been non-existent ever sincce the magic review. According to a critic who is \"very, very lucky to have dined at Rao's a few times,\"the experience rivals the tasty food.There are no menus at Rao's, and one of the owners will pull up a chair and run through the massive list of options, allowing people to have diner by mixing and matching nearly any ingredient with any classical Italian style of cooking. The place doesn't take credit cards, isn't open on weekends or for 1unch, and \"at some point during your meal the one-room restaurant will almost unavoidably break out in song.\" It is truly one of a kind,\"the critic wrote.

        "question": "Six years ago, a Miami woman walking through the hall of an office building casually noticed two men standing together. Several minutes after her leaving, the men murdered a person working in the building. Police investigators determined that the woman was the only witness who had seen the two suspects, and could possibly describe them. In an interview with police, her memory of the men proved disappointingly unclear. Several days later, psychologist Ronald P. Fisher was brought in to get a more complete description from the woman. Fisher's interview produced a breakthrough--the woman reported a clear picture of one of the suspects. She then recalled several details about his appearances. This information gave police important leads that enabled them to arrest the suspects and close the case.  Police investigators found the help from Fisher because of his rich knowledge in conducting the so-called cognitive   interview, a kind of memory-rebuilding process. In its original form, the cognitive interview focuses on guiding witnesses through four general recalling techniques: thinking about physical surroundings and personal feelings that existed at the time of past events, reporting everything that comes to mind about those events no matter how broken or unconnected, retelling events in kinds of time orders, beginning to end, end to beginning, forward or backward, and accepting different views while recalling events. Usually, an interviewer begins the cognitive approach by encouraging the witness to take an active role in recalling information rather than giving answers only to someone else's questions. The witness first describes what happened in his or her own words, with no interviewer interruptions. The interviewer then goes further with specific techniques, such as having the witness tell the details of what happened from different aspects. Experiments with police detectives trained in this demanding interview method find that they get nearly 50% more information from witnesses than before training, while error rates remain about the same. It can be inferred from the passage that in a cognitive interview, the interviewer mainly plays a   _   role.",

The group's position was approved by some experts. \"There is very little one can do in order to increase the chance of having a healthy brain when you get old,\" said Dr. Hans Forstl, who has studied boxing injuries. \" One of the best things you can do is avoid boxing.\" He said. According to the new statement, published in the journal Pediatrics, information from Canada shows a rise in boxing injuries over the past decade. Pat Russo, a retired police officer who runs a boxing gym in Brooklyn, New York, said injuries are rare in amateur boxing. After 26 years and training thousands of kids, he has seen just one split lip among his students. \" If the gym is run properly, injuries are at an absolute minimum,\" Russo said. \"Football is ten times more dangerous. While tennis or football might also help kids gain confidence, boxing holds a special attraction for children in poor neighborhoods, because it allows them to act tough while in trouble.\" Dr. Robert Cantu, a surgeon   at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts, said AAP's attitude makes sense for upper-class and middle-class kids. \" Clearly boxing is safer today than it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still a very risky activity,\" he said. \"For kids in poor areas, however, the situation is different,\" said Cantu. \" The most dangerous thing for the majority of people in boxing is just where they live.

Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula . Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole,  _  Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn. Most of the new coinages are restricted to special discussions and seldom get into general literature or conversation. Yet no profession is nowadays, as all profession once were, a closed guild  . The lawyer, the physician, the man of science, and the cleric   associate freely with his fellow creatures, and do not meet them in a merely professional way. Furthermore, what is called popular science makes everybody acquainted with modern views and recent discoveries. Any important experiment, though made in a remote laboratory, is at once reported in the newspapers, and everybody is soon talking about it--as in the case of the Roentgen rays and wireless telegraphy. Thus, our common speech is always taking up new technical terms and making them commonplace . ks5u What is the passage mainly about?",

        "question": "Dear Volunteers, The service you will provide to elderly individuals in Abilene as a Meals on Wheels volunteer is deeply appreciated. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for the many miles you will travel and all of the hours you will contribute to help make this one of the best programs in the entire state. We have our staff members make a home visit before adding each person to the program and try to visit everyone at least once every year. That is hardly enough, and we depend on your contact a great deal! It is important that you report back when you do not get an answer to your knock on the door. The person inside may be hurt or ill. They may be in hospital or out of town and fail to inform us. If they are frequently absent, we may need to determine if they still need meals. If you find someone with a medical emergency, please call 911 to request medical assistance, and then call the Meals on Wheels office. If you find someone who needs assistance other than for a medical emergency, please call the Meals on Wheels office at 6725050, and we will try to find the appropriate agency or individual to call. Let us know when a certain person needs extra food. We have a food preparation room of shelf stable items to share with them. Please feel free to take a few magazines when you deliver meals. Many of those we serve cannot afford magazines and enjoy reading. If someone is interested in getting books from the Abilene Public Library, let us know. We can sign them up for the Books on Wheels program. Call if you smell gas strongly when you deliver meals, or if someone needs a space heater, a blanket, or an electric fan. Please convey all needs to us, and we will try to see that they are met. Some of the elderly people who we offer our service may have cancers, liver diseases, AIDS, etc. If you do not want to deliver meals to the people with certain types of health problems, such as these, please let us know. Sincerely, Betty L. Bradley, LBSW, Executive Director What can we learn about the volunteers from the passage?",

        "question": "Most of us seem to reach our peak of alertness   around noon. Soon after that, alertness declines, and sleepiness may set in by mid-afternoon. Your short-term memory is best during the morning--in fact, about 15 percent more efficient than at any other time of day. So, students, take notice: when you are faced with a morning exam, _ to review your notes right before the test is given. However, long-term memory is different. Afternoon is the best time for learning materials that you want to recall days, weeks or months later. Politicians, business executives or others who must learn speeches would be smart to do their memorizing during that time of day. You should try to do most of your studying in the afternoon, rather than late at night. Many students believe they memorize better while burning the midnight oil because their short-term recall is better during the early hours of the morning than in the afternoon. But short-term memory won't help them much several days later, when they face the exam. By contrast, we tend to do best on tasks related to the process of knowing, understanding, and learning numbers during the morning hours. What about sports? During afternoon and early evening, you're able to react the quickest to an outside stimulus--like a baseball speeding toward you. Studies have also shown that late in the day, when your body temperature is peaking, you will consider PE easier and less tiring--whether it actually is or not. That means you are more likely to work harder during a late afternoon or early evening workout, and therefore benefit more from it. In fact, all of your senses--taste, sight, hearing, touch and smell--may be at their keenest during late afternoon and early evening. That could be why dinner usually tastes better to us than breakfast. While all of us follow the same general pattern of ups and downs, the exact timing varies from person to person. It all depends on how your \"biological\" day is structured. Each of us can increase our knowledge about our individual rhythms. Learn how to listen to the inner beats of your body; let them set the pace of your day. You will live a healthier and happier life. Which would be the best title for the passage?",

And next year,Rowena will be attending Harvard University.Billy,her younger brother,hopes to go to Cornell.What makes Rowena and Billy different from most students is that they don't go to school.In fact,they've never been to school.Since kindergarten,they've studied at home.Like many of more than one million people who receive home schooling in the United States, they feel as if they've gotten a good education. The home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job? The answer in many cases is yes.In many studies,students taught at home ranked average or above average when compared to students who went to public schools.More importantly,these students were often more self-directed and have a greater depth of knowledge.They were well prepared for academic challenges. One such student,Robert Conrad, now a sophomore at university, claims he really learned how to study and schedule his time during his eight years of home schooling.Still, not every student is as successful as Robert. \"For every home-schooling success story,there are an equal number of failures.\"states Henry Lipscomb,an educational researcher.\"There are just so many disadvantages that students taught at home have to overcome.\" For example,they have fewer chances to get in touch with others of their own age.Consequently,they sometimes lack the usual social skills.\"No matter what,though,\"states Lipscomb,\"home-schooling is a growing trend.I think we'll be seeing more and more of this.\" The best title of this text might be   _   .",

        "question": "In Sonoma County, California, growers are planting grapevines in a new way. As they plant the vines, they add a package of water called DRiWATER. This method of planting grapevines along with the water supply saves time and work. It gives the plant enough water to keep growing. The workers can go on to other chores. DRiWATER is a package of jelled   water. It melts slowly, watering the plant for two or three months. DRiWATER is a 100% natural, non-poisonous product used for the long-term watering of plants. It was invented by a well-known food chemist who recognized the potential of a filler product he was using to thicken peanut butter. He tested and applied his theory that water could be released over time as naturally occurring microbes   in the soil fed on the filler and released the water into the soil. The inventor, Harold Jensen, tried for a long time to get the right recipe. He and his family worked nights and weekends testing different formulas. Jensen finally found the right formula and patented it. What are the ingredients in DRiWATER? It is made up of 97.85% water, 2% vegetable gum, and 0.15% aluminum sulfate. When the DRiWATER is planted in the soil, the water is released as bacteria eat the jell. Buchanan Vineyard Services has bought ten thousand packages of DRiWATER. They will plant the jelled water with their new grapevines. What about countries like Egypt that have large deserts? Maybe DRiWATER will help grow trees in the desert. Two million trees have been planted near a town in the Sahara Desert. Two quarts were planted with each tree. The tree must live on the water for months until its roots touch ground water. Harold Jensen hopes to see forests spring up in the deserts. This is the reason that he invented DRiWATER. Seedlings, DRiWATER, and desert may be the perfect fit.

        "question": "A wallet that looks like a piece of newspaper, an atlas, or an express parcel receipt? Or a business card that looks like a notepad? No kidding. Bai Minghui, a Beijing-based designer, creates his artwork using Tyvek, a synthetic  paper material which is difficult to tear, waterproof and, more importantly, totally recyclable. Born to a worker family in 1983 in Tangshan, Hebei Province, Bai worked as a graphic designer at a financial magazine in Beijing after graduating from Minzu University of China. In the spring of 2008, Bai visited an exhibition about Tyvek in Beijing's 798 art zone, and then worked with the material, trying to bring his designs to life. The first thing that came into his mind was the paper wallet, a must-try handicraft assignment that most Chinese students do in elementary school. \"A paper wallet is definitely more useful than a paper crane or frog,\" Bai told Beijing Review, smiling. \"At first, many people have no idea what it is, because it looks like a piece of newspaper or an express parcel receipt, and feels like real paper. But it's hard to tear.\" \"The completed, folded wallet is seamless , which creates so much fun for a designer. To be honest, I didn't think about profits at all,\" he said. After months of research and development on printing and designing, the first generation of his paper wallet made a stunning debut in May 2008. The second generation, which offers a greater range of pattern options, was put on the market at the beginning of 2009. \"You can have graffiti or write down phone numbers on it, or paint whatever you like. I would like people to be able to use it easily,\" he said. \"I don't want to do things without creative ideas. Now my focus is on how to create better design rather than the wallet itself.\" What can people do with this kind of wallet?",

From the changing expressions on speakers' faces and the tones of their voices, they can tell lies from truths. Doctors studying the human brain have given a number of examples of this amazing power of aphasics. Some have even compared this power to that of a dog with an ability to find out the drugs hidden in the baggage. Recently, scientists carried out tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasics. It was proved that the aphasics were far ahead of the normal people in recognizing false speeches -- in most cases, the normal people were fooled by words, but the aphasics were not. Some years ago, Dr. Oliver Sacks wrote in his book about his experiences with aphasics. He mentioned a particular case in a hospital. Some aphasics were watching the president giving a speech on TV. Since the president had been an actor earlier, making a good speech was no problem for him. He was trying to put his feelings into every word of his speech. But his way of speaking had the opposite effect on the patients. They didn't seem to believe him. Instead, they burst into laughter. The aphasics knew that the president did not mean a word of what he was saying. He was lying! Many doctors see aphasics as people who are not completely normal because they lack the ability to understand words. However, according to Dr. Sacks, they are more gifted than normal people. Normal people may get carried away by words. Aphasics seem to understand human expressions better, though they cannot understand words. What do we learn from this text?",

        "question": "Smoking is the single worst thing you can do for your health. Fortunately, it's never too late to get the benefits of quitting. If you've tried to quit before and failed, it's time to make up your mind and try again. Smoking is responsible for one of every five deaths. That includes 29% of all cancer deaths, 87% of all lung cancer deaths, and nearly 20% of all deaths from cardiovascular disease. But long before smoking kills you, it ages you. You can see for yourself that smoking accelerates the drying and wrinkling of the skin. But there are less obvious effects as well. Indeed, smoking takes years away from your life. Nearly half of all chronic smokers die an average of 20 to 25 years before their time. Besides an early death from cancer or heart disease, smoking can cause lung disorders. People who smoke over a pack a day have almost three times the risk of contracting pneumonia  than that of nonsmokers. By lowering levels of estrogen in men and women, smoking speeds bone less. If a woman smokes a pack of cigarettes every day, she will enter menopause with 5 to 10% less bone mass than a nonsmoker. The good news is that no matter what your age is or how long you've smoked, you'll live longer if you quit today. The Coronary Artery Surgery Study examined nearly 2,000 long-term smokers over age 54. Those who quit had significantly lower death rates six years later than those who didn't. Even the oldest ex-smokers had a higher survival rate. Not only will live longer if you quit, you'll feel better, breathe easier, and find that you have more energy. You'll have fewer respiratory infections,headaches, and stomachaches. What's more, you'll save money. Your clothes and breath won't smell unpleasant any longer. And your habit won't annoy--or threaten the health of --the people who live and work with you. According to the passage, the percentage of deaths due to smoking is   _  .",

        "question": "The world shares him and London claims him, but Stratford-on-Avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating Shakespeare as their man: the bard of Avon, who was born there in 1564, and died there 400 years ago. Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeare's life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. \"People have seen Shakespeare as a Dick Whittington figure, who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die,\" he said. \"But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of Shakespeare, the man of Stratford.\" The anniversary of the death of the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world will be marked across Britain and the globe. Macbeth is about to open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeare's Globe is completing the first world tour, in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country. North Korea is still holding out, though. The Globe director recently jokily claimed Shakespeare as a true Londoner. Stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare. \"His old school room in Stratford-on-Avon where Shakespeare learned 'small Latin and less Greek' --as kindly laughed at by his friend Ben Johnson--will open its doors, scarred by centuries of naughty schoolboys, to mark 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death,\" said Paul Edmondson. Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the town, when he had made his fortune on the London stage. \"You don't buy a house like New Place and not live there,\" Paul said. He believes that after Shakespeare bought it, all his thinking time was spent there, and that the late plays, including The Tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there.

The statement has been released by the United Nations to mark UN Disaster Reduction Day. More people are made homeless by environmental disasters than by war,according to the research by the Red Cross. That reality is proved by the earthquake in Pakistan. The widely publicized disaster has brought aid from the global community,according to Janos Bogardi,director of the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security. \"If we can move swiftly in and give them a new start where they are,then they may stay in the area.

Janos Bogardi says these refugees suffer from the impact of gradual environmental change--global warming,sea level rise,air and water pollution and more intense storms,floods and droughts that degrade the land.

        "question": "It's rare that you see the words \"shyness\" and \"leader\" in the same sentence. After all, the common viewpoint is that those outgoing and sociable guys make great public speakers and excellent networkers and that those shy people are not. A survey conducted by USA Today referred to 65 percent of executives who believed shyness to be a barrier to leadership. Interestingly, the same article stresses that roughly 40 percent of leaders actually are quite shy--they're just better at adapting themselves to situational demands. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Charles Schwab are just a few \"innies\". Unlike their outgoing counterparts who are more sensitive to rewards and risk-taking, shy people take a cautious approach to chance. Rather than the flashy chit-chat that defines social gathering, shy people listen attentively to what others say and absorb it before they speak. They're not thinking about what to say while the other person is still talking, but rather listening so they can learn what to say. Along the same lines, shy people share a common love of learning. They are intrinsically  motivated and therefore seek content regardless of achieving an outside standard. Being shy can also bring other benefits. Remember being in school and hearing the same kids contribute, until shy little Johnny, who almost never said a word, cut in? Then what happened? Everyone turned around to look with great respect at little Johnny actually talking. This is how shy people made good use of their power of presence:they \"own\" the moment by speaking calmly and purposefully, which translate to a positive image. Shyness is often related to modesty. Not to say that limelight-seekers aren't modest, but shy people tend to have an accurate sense of their abilities and achievements. As a result, they are able to acknowledge mistakes, imperfections, knowledge gaps and limitations. Since shy people have a lower sensitivity to outside rewards than outgoing ones, they're more comfortable working with little information and sticking to their inner desires. Shy people are also more likely to insist on finding solutions that aren't primarily apparent. Don't believe me? Maybe you'll believe Albert Einstein, who once said, \" _ \" Obviously, finding certainty where uncertainty is typically popular is a huge plus for any successful person. The myth that shy people are less effective leaders than their outgoing fellows is just a misunderstanding.

The addition of the sun bear to the authoritative \"Red List\" after a major review means the American black bear and the brown bear, found from Europe to Alaska, are the only two of eight species still considered robust  .  The sun bear, found in Asia from Bangladesh to Borneo and weighing up to about 70kg, was rated \"vulnerable  \" by experts at the Union,which consists of more than 80 governments, conservation groups and scientists. The union said there were several thousand sun bears in the wild. \"We estimate that sun bears have declined by at least 30 percent over the past 30 years, and continue to decline at this speed,\" said Ron Steinmetz, head of the Swiss- based Union's sun bear expert team. Scientists did not change the level of threat to any bear species (except sun bears). Deforestation, loss of habitat to roads and cities and poaching are among risks. The Asian black bear, the sloth bear and the Andean bear were all proved again as vulnerable after reassessment of land-living bears.

        "question": "For many of us, a little time with our smartphones or iPads before sleep is the highlight of the night. But would you still think it is relaxing if you knew that it damages or destroys your sleep? Scientists say that's exactly what it does. In ancient times, when there were no lamps, telephones or smartphones, the sun was the main source of light. When the sun went down, our brains took that as a signal to start producing melatonin , a chemical that helps us sleep. However, a healthy amount of melatonin can only be produced in complete darkness.Any light in your bedroom--even the one on the alarm clock or the charging indicator on your cellphone--could disturb the process, not to mention something as bright as smartphone and iPad screens. We tend to hold these much closer than a television or laptop, which allows them to shoot far more light straight into our eyes. \"This is particularly worrisome in populations such as young adults and adolescents, who already tend to be _ ,\" said researcher Brittany Wood at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\"Lack of sleep among teens is leading to depression, selfharm, low concentration and poor performance at school,\" she added. While all lights are the enemy of sleep, not all colors of light have the same effect. Our eyes are particularly sensitive to blue light, which is common during the day. Most of the light coming from electronic screens is blue light and it fools our brain into thinking it's still daytime. By contrast, orange or red light has less influence on melatonin production, because our brains recognize it as a signal that the day is ending, according to The Telegraph. Asking yourself to keep your hands off your smartphone before bedtime might seem unreasonable, but you should at least remember to dim the screen or hold it farther away from your eyes.

After its first man in space, China plans a space laboratory, a lunar orbiter to look for valuable elements and minerals, robot landings on the moon and then the human touchdown. The price of space exploration is enormous. Russia and the US, the only two countries to have achieved manned flight, are struggling to keep their new investment, the international space station. But China, which has a long tradition in physics, mathematics and engineering, finds its doctoral graduates welcomed in the US and Europe for decades. And it has been able to learn from 40 years of pioneering successes and mistakes by the USSR and the USA. Space flight is a gamble and the stakes   are high. If successful, China could become a member of the world's most exclusive club, set up a second home on the moon and get a powerful hand at the strategic bargaining table. Two designers from the Shenzhou III project said that 12 astronauts now are undergoing intensive training. One more unmanned space flight is planned before the first manned launch. Experts say that the Shenzhou spacecraft already provides China with a space vehicle capable of mounting a lunar program.

French fries were introduced to the US when Thomas Jefferson served them in the White House during his presidency from 1801 t0 1809. Potato chips are popular with consumers as well. The humble potato is more than just a kind of food. In many ways it's part of the American pop culture. Let's take a look at some pop culture potatoes. Mashed Potato dance The Mashed Potato dance is a craze that began in 1962. The name of the dance came from the song it accompanies, Mashed Potato Time, performed by American R&B singer Dee Dee Sharp. The move vaguely resembles that of the Twist dance style, by Sharp's fellow Philadelphian, Chubby Checker. Hot Potato! Hot Potato!  is an action puzzle video game released in 2001. In the game the player must drive a bus and clear the road of alien potato beings. The potato beings are either red or blue; when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, they disappear. .Over the years, Hot Potato! has received mostly positive reception from critics. Mr. Potato Head Mr. Potato Head is an American toy invented by George Lerner in 1949. The toy consists of a plastic potato model and a variety of plastic parts like hands, feet, ears and mouths. In 1952, Mr. Potato Head became the first toy advertised on television. This commercial revolutionized marketing and caused a boom that solidified this toy's place in American pop culture.

And unfortunately, our picture of the people and the way of life of other countries is often a distorted  one. Here is a great argument in favor of foreign travel and learning foreign languages. It is only by traveling in a country and getting to know its inhabitants and their language that one can find out what a country and its people are really like. And how different the knowledge one gains this way frequently turns out to be from the second-hand information gathered from other sources! How often we find that the foreigners whom we thought to be such different people from ourselves are not very different at all! Differences between peoples do, of course, exist and, one hopes, will always continue to do so. The world will be a dull place indeed when all the different nationalities behave exactly alike, and some people might say that we are rapidly approaching this state of affairs. With the much greater rapidity and ease of travel, there might seem to be some truth in this at least as far as Europe is concerned.

        "question": "The term \"multitasking\" originally referred to a computer's ability to carry out several tasks at one time. For many people, multitasking has become a way of life and even a key to success. In fact, some excellent mental aerobic exercises involve engaging the brain in two or more challenging activities at a time. Although checking e-mail while talking on a phone and reading the newspaper may be second nature for some people, many times multitasking can make us less productive, rather than more. And studies show that too much multitasking can lead to increased stress, anxiety and memory loss. In order to multitask, the brain uses an area known as the prefrontal cortex  . Brain scans of volunteers performing multiple tasks together show that as they shift from task to task, this front part of the brain actually takes a moment of rest between tasks. You may have experienced a prefrontal cortex \"moment of rest\" yourself if you've ever dialed a phone number and suddenly forgotten who you dialed when the line is answered. What probably occurred is that between the dialing and the answering, your mind shifted to anther thought or task, and then took that \"moment\" to come back. Research has also shown that for many volunteers, job efficiency declines while multitasking, as compared to when they perform only one task at a time. Multitasking is easiest when at least one of the tasks is habitual, or requires little thought. Most people don't find it difficult to eat and read the newspaper at the same time. However, when two or more attention-requiring tasks are attempted at one time, people sometimes make mistakes. We often don't remember things as well when we're trying to manage several details at the same time. Without mental focus, we may not pay enough attention to new information coming in, so it never makes it into our memory stores. That is one of the main reasons we forget people's names--even sometimes right after they have introduced themselves. Multitasking can also affect our relationships. If someone checks their e-mail while on the phone with a friend, they may come off as absent-minded or disinterested. It can also cause that person to miss or overlook key information being passed on to them. People tend to make mistakes when   _  .",

A bully might say mean things about someone, take a kid's possessions or make fun of someone on purpose. Some bullies force people to do things they don't want to do. Why do bullies act so badly? Just to look for attention. They might think bullying is a way to be popular or a way to get what they want. Most bullies are trying to make themselves felt more important-when they pick on someone else, it makes them fell big and powerful. Some bullies come from families where everyone around has a normal way to act. Some bullies are copying what they've seen someone else do. Some have been bullied themselves. Bullying can be a big pain, but you don't have to let bullying you. Sometimes just acting bravely is enough to stop a bully. If you walk by and hold your head high as though you're not afraid, a bully may be less likely to give you trouble. Bullies want a big reaction to their meanness. Acting as if you don't notice and don't care is like giving no reaction at all, and this just might stop a bully's behavior. If you are being bullied, it's very important to tell an adult. Teachers, principals, parents, and lunchroom helpers at school can all help to stop bullying. Don't hit, kick, or push back to deal with someone bullying you or your friends.

Things were similar last year in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them? People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution. Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from \"birth\" to \"death\".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant. The secret behind the colorchanging material is a type of molecule  .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red. The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. If the bright light keeps the red color from appearing,the material's warning system will be useless. Scientists still have a lot of work to do before the colorchanging molecules can be used outside the lab. What does the passage mainly introduce?",

This new sport needs two-legged humans running on all fours! The funny idea is the brainchild of Shaun McCarthy. The 34-year-old is convinced that it will revolutionize fitness as we know it. According to the sports enthusiast, \"The only thing that crunning's changed about fitness is that it's changed everything about fitness.\" Mccarthy has no scientific evidence to prove that crunning is more efficient than traditional two-legged running. However, he believes it is a more effective way to exercise because it puts an emphasis on the shoulders and arms, providing a complete body workout. Mccarthy also says crunning seems to tire him out more. He therefore concludes that the unconventional exercise is a bigger calorie burner than normal running. While experts generally agree that crunning may provide a better workout, many are not sure if it is the right exercise for humans. Fitness coach Kevin Dean says we are not built to be on all fours and our wrists are therefore not as strong as our ankles. He believes crunning, which he calls a fad , could result in bad wrist and shoulder injuries, not to mention broken noses. But McCarthy is not worried. Since the release of his crunning video a few weeks ago, many Melbourne residents have been seen scampering around on all fours. As it turns out they are not the only ones. In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, crawling, a much slower version of crunning, has been a favorite activity for many years. According to some enthusiasts, the light exercise that is believed to date back two thousand years to the Han Dynasty, is good for curing back and spine ailments. Ready to give crunning try?

I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered. And then I tried hard to get out of the dust, the angry bees made a new attack on me. I was tired out and ran weakly about in circles. Soon I lost my consciousness  . Later I learned that two quick-minded villagers ran to a pile of dry grass and quickly surrounded   me with a thick wall of fire and smoke until the bees were driven away. They stayed with me, taking stings out of my body for the next three hours until a doctor came and gave me further treatment. Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?",

Many people have heard stories like this. But the situation is more worrying still and it involves parents. Every child, regardless of the circumstances into which they are born, has the right to achieve their potential, regardless of their parents' wealth and class. And we recognize that, as a nation, it is a long way to achieve this goal. But with rights come responsibilities and what worries people is that we are in danger of ignoring the latter. Far too many children are behaving badly at school, even to the point of being violent to staff. This is terrible enough, but it is hard to be surprised since many children are just mirroring the behaviour of their parents. My members tell me that parents also come into school often and threaten staff and some staff have been attacked by a pupil's parents. One father encouraged his child to start a fight on the playground before school started. A primary teacher reported that a parent shouted at him. We need to have a serious and sensible debate about the roles and responsibilities of parents and the support that they can reasonably expect of schools and teachers. Children will not learn how to behave as social beings if they are stuck in front of the TV for hours every day. They need their parents to show an interest in them and to spend time with them, helping them to play with their peers  and to learn the rules of social behavior. Children are now arriving at school socially undeveloped, increasingly unable to dress themselves, unable to use the toilet properly, unable to hold a knife and fork and unused to eating at a table, Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, writes in today's Observer. Instead of taking responsibility themselves, too many parents expect teachers to control their children's behaviour and wellbeing, she adds. Bousted says one mother blamed staff when she discovered that her 16-year-old son was smoking. We are in danger of becoming a nation of _ . The bedroom, once a place to sleep, has become the living space for the young. Spending hours in front of computer screens, on social networking sites or being immersed  in computer games, children and young people spend little time with their parents. Parents are unable to monitor just what their children are watching. Schools cannot right the wrongs of society and teachers cannot become substitute parents. Both parties need to work together. Parents must be helped and given confidence to take back control. They are responsible for setting boundaries for their children's behaviour and sticking to those boundaries. They are responsible for setting a good example to their children and for devoting that most precious of resources -- time -- so that children come to school ready and willing to learn.

        "question": "In the next five years, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) jobs are projected to grow twice as quickly as jobs in all other fields according to the U.S. Bureau of Statistics. While all jobs are expected to grow by 10.4 percent, STEM jobs are expected to increase by 21.4 percent. By this measure, future STEM jobs represent a huge opportunity to today's students. But, in fact, of the 3.8 million ninth graders in the U.S., only 233,000 end up choosing a STEM degree in college, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. This means only 6 percent of ninth graders will become STEM graduates. And of these graduates, women will be even more underrepresented in most STEM fields. These are alarming statistics. How do we get more young boys and girls to be interested in STEM-related fields? It isn't an easy task. Schools do not always adequately prepare students for these severe subjects, and college programs are designed to get rid of those who are less persistent. Nationally, only 41 percent of initial STEM majors who begin a degree in STEM-related fields complete their degree in less than six years. In addition, social pressures continue to cast a shadow over girls who might otherwise consider the STEM fields. A couple of years ago, I met amazing parents, both of whom had a background in engineering and hoped their 10-year-old daughter would follow in their footsteps. They encouraged her to take an after-school science / robotics program. When she got there, she found she was outnumbered 6:1 by boys in the class. As the only girl, she came home crying much of the time because she was teased and told that geeky girls are not welcome in the boys' club. Ironically, by the time young boys are entering college programs in STEM fields, many complain about the lack of girls. Starting at an early age, even as young as kindergarten, we need to encourage and help the next generation leaders to consider taking up science, computing, math and technology. We also need to realize that for young girls to be inspired to take and stick with this educational path and later career field, they will benefit from the support of the people that surround them: parents, teachers, friends and family members.

        "question": "Florence Nightingale was born in 1820. Growing up, she was a quiet and serious girl. She spent a lot of time playing with her dolls. She would pretend that the dolls were sick and she was their nurse. People would bring sick or hurt animals to her to look after. She even managed to mend a dog's broken leg when she was a young girl. She often went with her mother to visit the poor people. They took food and medicine to the sick. It was these visits that gave her the idea of becoming a nurse.      Florence really wanted to be a doctor but she couldn't because in those days only men were allowed to become doctors. She decided that she wanted to become a nurse. Her parents were very angry;the daughters of rich people did not work at all and certainly they did not become nurses. But Florence had made up her mind to specialize in nursing.      Her chance came in 1854 when Britain went to war with Russia in a place called the Crimea. Florence was asked to take a group of nurses to look after the sick and wounded soldiers. The hospitals were dirty, and there was not enough medicine. There were not enough beds, so some people were just lying on rags in the mud. There was so much sickness that the doctors could not treat all the soldiers. Florence and her team cleaned the hospital rooms and beds. They made sure that the soldiers got enough medicine. The army was unhappy because there were women so close to the fighting. They gave the nurses a lot of trouble. Florence and her team worked hard and got over all the difficulties they had to face.      Florence became famous as \"The Lady of the Lamp\". At night she would go from room to room checking on the patients. There was no electricity so she would carry an oil lamp with her to see where she was going. She often stayed to talk to the patients.      After the war, Florence returned to London as a national hero. A great welcome was prepared for her, but she slipped into the country unnoticed. She opened a school to teach nurses how to look after their patients properly. She never really got better from the illness that she had in the Crimea and she died in 1910.      Now Florence Nightingale is known as the mother of modem nursing. She had devoted her whole life to patients. It is because of her work that we receive the proper care in hospitals today.

        "question": "At 2 p.m. on December 5, 1945, five Navy aircraft took off in perfect flying weather from a naval air installation in southeastern Florida, on a routine training mission over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the flight commander radioed that he was \"completely lost\". Then there was silence. A rescue plane was sent to search for the missing aircraft, and it, too, disappeared. Despite one of history's most extensive search efforts, involving more than 300 planes and dozens of ships, the Navy found nothing, not even an oil stain floating on the water. This is just one of the many frightening stories told of \"the Bermuda Triangle\", a mysterious area of the Atlantic Ocean roughly stretching southwest from Bermuda to the Florida coast and down to Puerto Rico. During the past 30 years, the triangle has claimed the lives of some 1,000 sailors and pilots. Stranger yet are the numerous \"ghost\" ships that have been found floating crewless within the triangle. On one strange occasion in 1881, the cargo shipEllen Austindiscovered a small sailing ship, sails waving uselessly in the wind. The boat was full of wood with no one on deck. The captain of theEllen Austininstalled a new crew to sail it, but two days later, during a rough storm, the two ships temporarily lost sight of each other. When the captain again boarded the boat, he found his crew had disappeared. After a second crew was assigned, the ship was again lost in a fog bank. This time, no trace of the boat -- or the crew -- was ever found. Charles Berlitz, a man with an interest in Atlantis, the legendary lost island, puts forward his theory that a giant solar crystal, which once was the power generator for Atlantis, lies on the ocean floor. From time to time, according to his theory, passing ships and planes set off the crystal, which confuses their instruments and _ them into the ocean. Officially, the U.S. Navy does not recognize the triangle as a danger zone and is convinced that \"the majority of disappearances in the triangle can be due to the unique features of the area's environment.\" These include the swift Gulf Stream current and the unexplored valleys under water of the Atlantic. Also, the triangle is one of only two places on earth where a compass needle points to true north rather than magnetic north, causing problems in navigation. However, other scientists argue that beings from outer space have established a highly advanced civilization in the unexplored depths of the Atlantic inside the triangle. There, they believe, most of the missing vessels - and their crews - may still be on display for study by these higher intelligences.

        "question": "Television is a relatively stable advertising medium. In many ways, the television ads today are almost the same to those two decades ago. Most television ads still feature actors, still run 30 or 60 seconds, and still show a product. However, the different medium of the Internet causes unique challenges to advertisers, forcing them to adapt their practices and techniques. In the early days of Internet marketing, online advertisers used banner   and pop-up ads   to attract customers. These techniques reached large audiences, led to many sales leads, and came at a low cost. However, a small number of Internet users began to consider these advertising techniques annoying. Yet because marketing strategies relying heavily on banners and pop-ups produced results, companies invested growing amounts of money into purchasing these ad types. As consumers became more complicated, frustration with these online advertising techniques grew. Independent programmers began to develop tools that blocked banner and pop-up ads. A major development in online marketing came with the introduction of pay-per-click ads. Unlike banner or pop-up ads, which originally required companies to pay every time a website visitor saw an ad, pay-per-click ads allowed companies to pay only when an interested potential customer clicked on an ad. More importantly, however, these ads are not affected by the pop-up and banner blockers. As a result of these advantages and the incredible growth in the use of search engines, which provide excellent places for pay-per-click advertising, a great number of companies began turning to pay-per-click marketing. However, as with the banner and pop-up ads, pay-per-click ads came with their shortcomings. When companies began pouring billions of dollars into this emerging medium, online advertising specialists started to notice the presence of what would later be called click fraud  : representatives of a company with no interest in the product advertised by a competitor click on the competitor's ads simply to increase the marketing cost of the competitor. Click fraud grew so rapidly that marketers sought to diversify   their online positions away from pay-per-click marketing through new mediums. Although pay-per-click advertising remains a common and effective advertising tool, marketers adapted yet again to the changing elements of the Internet by adopting new techniques such as pay-per-performance advertising. As the pace of the Internet's evolution increases, it seems all the more likely that advertising successfully on the Internet will require a strategy that avoids constancy   and welcomes change.

Folding Steamer The simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel version. Advantages:This is a good,basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of  pans with the water under it;a ring in the centre allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean. Disadvantages:It only holds small dishes.Also,if you put too much water in the pan,it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery.If you put too little water in and let it get dry,you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables. Steaming Pan This is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled  steamers,which sits on the oven ring.The brand I bought is calledNutritious Living. Advantages:This is an excellent steamer, lightweight,easy to clean,and of all the steamers I've tried,this cooks the fastest.Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top.It's easier to store. Disadvantages:Water can boil away until the pan is dry,but if you make sure you fill the  pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food,this should not happen.You cannot  see the food cooking from the top.It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice.

Keep them, and you'll become thin. *Wake-up  When you wake up in the morning, sit up slowly without using your hands. With legs straight out, lean forward  until you feel sore  in your back. It will use up 10 calories. *Start with soup  Order a clear soup, and have it before the main food. In this way, you'll feel fuller, so you'll eat less when the main food comes. *An apple or more a day  Apples are full of fiber  and water, so your stomach will want less. Studies show that people who eat at least three apples or pears a day may lose weight. *Talk it up  Every time you use the cell phone, stand up and walk around. Heavy people sit on average two and a half hours more each day than thin people. This skill is very important and standing up and walking around will burn up 50 or more calories. Use these skills, and you will have a big weight loss. How many skills are there in the text for people to lose weight?",

With growing confidence, I decided to take the subway to the hotel, not realizing that the network didn't go that far. Impressed with the cleanliness of the station, I bought a ticket and boarded the first train that came along. After a few minutes I asked in English of course a young man seated next to me where I should get off closest to the Friendship Hotel. Wearing a smart business suit and tie, he would surely speak English, wouldn't he? Unfortunately, he couldn't understand me but seemed very friendly. I showed him the room card with all the information of the Friendship Hotel in Chinese characters. He looked at it, and then his eyes moved quickly to the carriage   subway map. Next, he raised three fingers of his right hand. In Australia, raising fingers at someone is not usually nice, but this man wasn't smiling. At the next station he showed me two fingers. Now in   Australia, that's really rude, but I got the message. When we stopped at the third station, he didn't just point to the door, but got up, took me out of the train, and led me to the top of the stairs, and out onto the street. Then he stopped a taxi and told the driver where to take me. All this came from a man who couldn't speak my language, and I couldn't speak his. I was now speechless, especially when he refused my offer of money. I felt a little embarrassed having even thought he would accept a tip.

Perhaps it's not quite as sublimely  beautiful as the opening, but a fitting end to what has been a memorable 12 days in the Chinese capital. The Paralympics were inspiring. Not only the Paralympians themselves, but also the warmth of people in Beijing and the sense of self-respect among the disabled in China that these Games seem to have inspired, as well as a new attitude in general from the government and form Chinese society as a whole. -- Jeff Z. prefix = st1 /Klein,New YorkTimes It doesn't get any better for disabled persons living in Beijingthan September 2008, with increased access for them in public areas. But there are still problems. Some taxi drivers are not willing to pick up wheelchair users.

Senior officials from Malaysia, Australia and China met in the Australian capital to  _ the details of the next steps in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which will center around an expanded patch of seafloor in a remote area of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia.The area became the focus of the hunt after a team of analysts calculated the plane's most likely flight path based on satellite and radar data.Starting Wednesday, that data will be re-analyzed and combined with all information gathered thus far in the search, which hasn't turned up a single piece of debris   despite crews searching more than 4.6 million square kilometers of ocean. \"We've got to this stage of the process where it's very sensible to go back and have a look at all of the data that has been gathered, all of the analysis that has been done and make sure there's no flaws in it, the assumptions are right, the analysis is right and conclusions are right,\" Angus Houston, head of the search operation, told reporters in Canberra.

I remember that my teacher allowed each student to take turns playing various educational games on the computer. One day, I found the source code   for one of these games. Without knowing or being taught any programming language, I was able to figure out some _ of the BASIC code. Anyone who knows a bit of programming can tell you that I just give myself an infinite   number of lives in the game, so I can continue playing forever. This was also my first introduction to algebra  , and I didn't even know it at the time. This was a decisive   moment in my life. For the first time that I can remember, I was quite happy because of what I was learning and what I was able to do. As a result, I became enthusiastic for the rest of my life about self-learning and computers, and I was quite happy doing them, too. I've noticed that people who are truly content with life are enthusiastic in what they do. This enthusiasm, along with good health, is the key to being happy. It also leads to self-confidence and fulfillment in life, too. It may also lead to success, wealth, and achievements. Yes, success, wealth, or achievements seem to bring some people happiness, too. Yet, I don't think they can indeed make people happy. I know plenty of people who are successful and wealthy. However, I also know several of the people with successful businesses are not happy with what they are doing. I know people who continuously buy themselves new toys, cars, computers, and televisions, yet they never seem content for too long.

        "question": "Are you a forgetful person? You might be able to blame your genes, a new study in the journal Neuroscience Letters suggests. Researchers from the University of Bonn have identified a variant  on the DRD2 gene that seems to be associated with increased forgetfulness. Everyone has one of two variants of the DRD2 gene, the difference is just one letter in the genetic code: Some people have the cytosine (C) variant, while others have the thymine (T) variant. The researchers wanted to see how having one variant over another was associated with forgetfulness. To test this, they analyzed the DRD2 gene of 500 study participants, and also had the participants answer surveys about their forgetfulness (such as how often they misplaced their keys, or forgot names). Most of the study participants--three quarters of them--had the thymine gene variant, while the other quarter had the cytosine gene variant. Researchers found an association between more forgetfulness problems and having the thymine gene variant of DRD2. Meanwhile, the cytosine gene variant seemed to have a protective effect against forgetfulness. However, \"there are things you can do to compensate for forgetfulness; writing yourself notes or making more of an effort to put your keys down in a specific location--and not just anywhere,\" study researcher Dr. Sebastian Markett, of the University of Bonn, said in a statement. Research has also suggested that some age groups are more forgetful than others. A recent national poll showed that millenials, who were born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, are actually more likely than seniors to be absent-minded with things like what day of the week it is, where they put their keys and remembering to bring their lunch.

        "question": "Three years ago, five parrots were set free in a wild place of Arizona, thousands of miles from the Channel Islands in Jersey where they had been looked after by zookeepers. No evolutionary strategies informed them how to behave in this new landscape of mountainous pine forest unoccupied by their kind for 50 years. To the researchers' surprise, they failed to make contact with a group of wild parrots imported from Mexico and set free at the same time. Within 24 hours the reintroducing ended in failure, and the poor birds were back in cages, on their way to the safety of the Arizona reintroduction programme. Ever since then, the programme has enjoyed great success, mainly because the birds now being set free are Mexican birds illegally caught in the wild, confiscated   on arrival north of the border, and raised by their parents in the safety of the programme. The experience shows how little we know about the behaviour and psychology   of parrots, as Peter Bennett, a bird researcher, points out: \"Reintroducing species of high intelligence like parrots is a lot more difficult. People like parrots, always treating them as nothing more than pets or valuable 'collectables'.\" Now that many species of parrot are in immediate danger of dying out, biologists are working together to study the natural history and the behaviour of this family of birds. Last year was an important turning point: conservationists founded the World Parrot Trust, based at Hayle in Cornwall, to support research into both wild and caged birds. Research on parrots is vital for two reasons. First, as the Arizona programme showed, when reintroducing parrots to the wild, we need to be aware of what the birds must know if they are to survive in their natural home. We also need to learn more about the needs of parrots kept as pets, particularly as the Trust's campaign does not attempt to discourage the practice, but rather urges people who buy parrots as pets to choose birds raised by humans.

This important role involves greeting fans from all over the world, welcoming them to the fantastic capital city of London and providing a friendly face as well as help, advice and a good old traditional warm British welcome. The view of London most visitors take away with them after the 2012 Olympics will mostly _ the volunteers and ambassadors, so these roles play a very important part in the process of making the UK a great place to travel to. Becoming a London Ambassador is a brilliant way to be involved with the London 2012 volunteers scheme and become a part of what should be an historic summer. Why are London 2012 volunteers called \"Game Makers\"?",

Looking at this, the lawyer suggested a dinner together, just three of them, wife thought, why not, since they are still going to be friends. At the dining table, there was a silence of awkwardness . The first dish was roasted chicken, immediately, the old man took the drumstick  for the old lady. \"Take this, it's your favorite.\" Looking at this, the lawyer thought maybe there's still a chance, but the wife was frowning when she answered. \"This is always the problem, you always think so highly of yourself, never thought about how I feel, don't you know that I hate drumsticks?\" Little did she know that, over the years, the husband had been trying all ways to please her, little did she know that drumsticks were the husband's favorite. Little did he know that she never thought he understood her at all, little did he know that she hated drumsticks even though all he wanted was the best for her.

I did not pay much attention to it at first. It felt that I had water in my ear. However, I began to hear less and less out of that ear. I even had to ask people to talk into my other ear so that I could hear them. I didn't realize how serious it was until late in the day  . One evening, when I was sitting on my bed doing chemistry homework, I fell off my bed. When trying to get up, I was incredibly dizzy  . I went to see a doctor and he told me that hearing loss was common. However, hearing loss is usually bilatera _ or occurs in both ears. He said that my hearing should come back within a week. After about a week the dizziness eventually went away, but the hearing loss did not. The medicine helped and I gained some of my hearing back. After many hearing tests, the doctor diagnosed   that I had permanent hearing loss in that ear. School became harder for me because I couldn't hear my teachers. I was very depressed. Finally, I bought a hearing aid. With the hearing aid, my hearing is almost back to normal. It makes school and group conversations easier. My friends, teachers and even complete strangers always ask me questions about hearing loss. I answer them patiently. I never get offended because I know this is new to them. I am delighted that I can teach them something new. What I have learned from this particular situation is that when things are desperate(;), there is always something good that can come out of it. My experiences have given me an opportunity to teach people about hearing loss and also taught me about the value of hearing. At present, the author is  _  .",

The following steps can help you find cheaper alternatives for transport for your London trip. l Familiarize yourself with the city's boroughs and specifically the area where you will be staying. You can use a street map, or an online map search engine, to establish where in the city you will be staying and the distance you are from the major tourist attractions you want to visit. l Find a local provider of Transport for London tickets or travel cards, since your first bargain purchase will be an Oyster Card. Traveling around London with an Oyster Card will give you access to the cheapest option of transportation methods and the Oyster Card is accepted citywide on buses, boats and the London Underground, known by the locals as \"the tube\". l Seek out your nearest Tube Station. The Tube is the cheapest and most reliable form of transportation and runs from around 6 a.m. until around 1 a.m. ..., depending on the line or the station. There are 287 tube stations in London that accept the Oyster Card, with a high concentration in central London. If you are staying anywhere in central London, there will be a tube station less than 10 minutes away. The Transport for London website offers a tube station search facility to find the nearest subway station to any location in the city. When you find a tube station, you can easily locate the closest bus stop by using the comparison bus-tube maps at the station's entrance. l Follow the Transport for London Tube Guide to your destinations and always plan ahead.

        "question": "Most parents of kids under age 8 don't worry about how much time they spend watching TV or using other media, from computers to smart phones to tablets PCs, according to a new survey that found a child's use of media often reflects how much time parents spend in the similar way.  We generally found that media use is not a source of conflict in the home\" for families with young children, Ellen Wartella, a researcher from Northwestem University, told USA Today. She led a survey of 2,326 parents who have children 8 and younger.It found that in 80 percent of families, children's media use was not a problem, with 55 percent \"not too\" or\" not at all\"  concerned about it. It also showed parents have more positive than negative feelings about how media consumption affects a child's learning and the development of creativity.The exception is video games, which are viewed more negatively than TV, computers or mobile devices.\"Parents rated video games as more likely to have a negative effect on children's school performance, attention time, creativity, social skills, behavior and sleep than any other medium,\" the researchers said in a news conference about the survey.  The findings exposes a generational shift   in parental attitudes about technology's role in young children's lives,\" said Wartella.\"Today's parents grew up with technology as a central pact of their lives, so they think about it differently than earlier generations of parents, instead of a battle with kids on one side and parents on the other, the use of media and technology has become a family affair. \" The researchers identified three media environments created by parents: media-centric (39 percent of families) , media-moderate (45%)and media-light (16%). Children  in media-centric families spend at least three hours more each day watching TV or using computers, video games and tablet PCs don't make parenting easier.And 88 percent of parents say they are most likely to turn to toys or activities to keep their children occupied.Slightly fewer turn to books (79%) and TV(78%). The survey didn't look at how media affects children. That's a topic that the American Academy of Pediatrics has handled a number of times. The AAP says studies have found too much media use can lead to attention- problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders and being fat. In addition, the Internet and cell phones can provide platforms for illegal and risky behaviors. By limiting screen time and offering educational media and non-electronic formats  such as books, newspapers and board games, and watching television with their children, parents can help guide their children's media experience. Putting questionable content into context and teaching kids a700ut advertising contributes to their media literacy   ,\" it says. The pediatricians' group says parents should have \"screen-free zones\"  and TV should be turned off during dinner. At most, it recommends children and teens engage with entertainment media for no more than two hours a day and that should be high-quality content. It is important for kids to spend time on outdoor play, reading, hobbies  and  using their imaginations  in free  play.\" Kids  under 2 should not use television and other entertainment media because their brains are developing quickly and they learn best from direct human interaction,\" the group says. An article on screen time by t.he Mayo Clinic also notes problems linked t.o over screen time, including  being  fat, irregular  sleep , behavioral  problems , weak  school  performance , violence  and  less time for active and creative play.

Wind and energy from the sun are generally considered clean, unlike energy from coal-burning power stations. However, environmentalists now worry that too much solar power development could harm the local environment. A California company -- BrightSource Energy is building a huge solar power plant in the Mojave desert, about 60 kilometers southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. The plant is known as the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System. Joe Desmond works for the company. \"This is actually one of the highest concentrations of sunlight in the world, out here in Ivanpah.\" explained Desmond. BrightSource Energy will deploy 170,000 specially designed mirrors to direct solar energy towards boilers on top of three power towers. The steam produced in the boilers will drive turbine   to make electricity. Joe Desmond says the steam can reach temperatures of more than 260 degrees Celsius. \"We can store the sun's thermal energy in the form of molten salt, so we can produce electricity even when the sun goes down. There is a lot of interest in concentrating solar power around the globe in environmnents where you have lots of sun, such as China, South Africa, the Middle East, North Africa, explained Desmond. Environmentalists generally support the idea of solar power, however, many are concerned about the effect of power plants on sensitive environment. Lisa Belenky is a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, a private group. She says environmentalists are specifically worried about the effect of the Ivanpah Solar Project on the sensitive plant and animal life in that part of Mojave desert. \"Even though the desert seems big, when you start cutting it up, it can really affect how the species and the animals and the plants are able to survive in the long run,\"said Lisa Belenky. BrightSource Energy has already spent more than $ 50 million to move endangered desert tortoises away from the power plant. but Lisa Belenky says this is not the answer. \"We should be reusing areas that have a1ready been disturbed, like old mining sites, for example...either on homes, on businesses, parking lots.\" said Belenky. There have also been reports of birds dying at the Ivanpah Plant and others like it. Some birds die after colliding with solar equipment which the animals mistake for water. Other birds were killed or suffered burns after flying through the intense heat at the solar thermal plant. As solar projects increase, environmentalists and developers are considering what to do to reduce bird death. The author's attitude towards the solar projects is   _  .",

Colouring, for example, varies according to what the producers are trying to sell. Health foods are packaged  in greens, yellows or browns because we think of these as healthy colours. Ice cream packets are often blue and expensive goods, like chocolates, are gold or silver.

Eventually, it came on the market in a dark blue and white package--blue because we think of it as safe, and white as calm. The size of a product can attract a shopper. But quite often a bottle doesn't contain as much as it appears to. It is believed that the better-known companies spend, on average, 70 percent of the total cost of the product itself on packaging!

        "question": "Like most parents, I worry that my child isn't getting enough sleep. Now it turns out that doctors have been warning kids don't get enough sleep for over a century--long before iPads, and texting robbed children of peaceful sleep. What's more, there's no solid scientific basis for pediatricians'   recommendations on the amount of time children need to sleep. That's the word from researchers in Australia. It turns out that children are sleeping less than those in days of old. The researchers, at the University of South Australia's Health and Use of Time Group, found that kids' nightly sleep time declined   by about three-quarters of a minute each year for the period they studied. My daughter was more likely to beg for a few more minutes of Angry Birds before bedtime.That means nowadays my daughter is sleeping about 50 minutes a night less than her grandfather who had to get up to milk the cows at 5:30 am. What hasn't changed is the predictions from health professionals on the consequences of lack of sleep. \"This is a sleepless age and more and more... we are turning night into day,\" one expert said in 1905. Back then, sleep was seen as a way to restore \"wearied brain tissue\". Children and \"clever\" children were thought to be most at risk, and most in need of energy-restoring sleep. The words may be different today, but the threats are pretty much the same. Parents are told that children risk mental and physical problems, and even obesity, if they don't get enough sleep. So the Australians looked to see how much sleep kids do need. The answer is the biggest surprise of this study--no one really knows. \"There is almost no exact evidence for proper sleep for children,\" the authors write.

The gas is produced at a sewage treatment works plant in Didcot. The entire process takes only less than three weeks, with the sewage being collected and sent first to settlement tanks. The solid waste material is then fed into digesters, where anaerobic bacteria digest the sewage, with the aid of enzymes to speed up the process. The digestion process produces methane, which can be burned to drive machines to produce electricity, or can be purified and fed into the gas network and piped to homes and businesses. British Gas says supplying the gas rather than electricity is far more efficient since around two-thirds of the energy is lost in producing electricity. Partners in the Didcot project, British Gas, Scotia Gas Networks, and Thames Water, all hope to expand the process to other towns, and other companies such as Ecotricity and United Utilities have also announced biomethane projects being planned. One of these projects, in Manchester, could be supplying 500 homes with biomethane by mid next year. Another British Gas project in Suffolk will provide gas from digestion of brewery wastes to around 235 families. The Didcot project cost PS2.5m and was influenced by promises of government aids aimed at encouraging companies to develop renewable technologies. An EU directive means the UK must ensure at least 15 percent of its energy is from renewable sources by 2020. The UK produces about 1.73 million tons of sewage annually. If all sewage treatment works in the UK were fitted with the technology, they could supply gas for up to 350,000 families. What should the text belong to?",

        "question": "To save yourself from embarrassment  , it's good to read a few books or research online about the culture and customs of the country you plan to visit. Clothing: Wearing shorts in public is generally not acceptable in most parts of the world, including some European countries. Greetings: Handshake is a usually accepted form of greeting, although in some countries, like Japan, a traditional bow  is preferred. Be careful how you talk with someone; don't use first names unless you are invited to do something. Language/Gestures: learn some polite expressions (hello-goodbye-thank you) and relax. English is pretty common worldwide, especially in tourist areas and you can always use body language to get your message across. However, some Americans gestures have different meanings in other countries. For example, in Bulgaria, shaking your head usually means  \"yes\"; shaking it \"vertically\" means \" no\". Food/Drink: you may find yourself looking down at a local delicious snake soup in china, sheep's eyes in Saudi Arabia... and wonder what to do; especially you are guests in someone's home. Be brave, take small bites, and pretend it tastes like something you like. Remember that some Buddhists don't eat beef, and Muslims don't eat pork. If you are eating with Muslims, never touch food with left hand (the left hand is for bathroom use). Conversations: if you know the history and culture of the country, you will be confident. The French are angry at the classic American question: \"What do you do for a living?\" and so on. Which of the following isn't right?",

If you're unlucky enough to be stuck with classmates who don't really \"get\" you, you've just got to try to make the best of it. But that doesn't mean you need to \"fit in\", or at least in the way that people think. If you try to transform yourself into a clone of everyone else, it won't help you make friends. It'll just make you feel like a fake. You also shouldn't shut down or refuse to be friends with everyone who doesn't like you. If you do that, you'll just make yourself miserable. Instead, you've got to work on being comfortable and confident with whom you are while ignoring all the haters. Keep on speaking up, asking questions and getting to know people better. If you send out positive energy, then people will generally send some back to you. A couple of them will stay the same, and you're allowed to forget about them. If you feel like you're doing all that but still not getting anywhere, then don't give up. Just expand your circle. Get a part-time job at a cool-looking place, join an after-school art class or youth group--do whatever it takes to find a couple of like-minded people to connect with. Even if you don't find anyone right away, you'll still be getting some more social experiences under your belt, and that's always a good thing. A fun book called Uncool, by Erin Elisabeth Conley, has some tips for folks like you who want to stay positive at school while being true to your personality: *Throw caution to the wind. *Don't tolerate others' mistakes. *Have patience with people who are different from you. *Don't change just because someone else thinks you should. *Know that even though you may be a misfit, there's always some place where you will be welcomed in the world.

        "question": "Aggressive pedestrians are in fact as dangerous as careless drivers. They cause traffic accidents, injury and death. These dangerous walkers can be seen in any big city over the world. About 69% of last year's pedestrian deaths in the US occurred in urban areas. They cross streets ignoring \"DON'T WALK\" signals, suddenly appear without warning from behind parked vehicles, walk slowly at crossroads with cell phones attached to heads, blocking traffic. These pedestrians and drivers share a common disregard for the rules of the road, both for selfish reasons. The drivers believe in the power of their machines. If their machines can go faster, they believe they have the right to go faster. If their machines are bigger, they believe they have the right to push smaller vehicles aside. Aggressive pedestrians, on the other hand, believe in the primacy  of the individual, the idea that they are first in any environment, under any circumstances, even when they are on foot in a roaring tide of steel and rubber. Last year, an estimated 5,220 pedestrians died in traffic accidents. Some 69,000 pedestrians were injured. On average, that worked out to one pedestrian killed in a traffic crash every 101 minutes, and one injured every eight minutes. The good news is that the accident rate is dropping. For example, the number of pedestrians killed last year was 24 percent less than the number killed in traffic accidents a decade earlier. The bad news is that the basic causes of pedestrian deaths remain pretty much the same----disregard for traffic signals, inattention and crossing roads under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Alcohol, in fact, was involved in 46 percent of the traffic accidents that resulted in pedestrian deaths. Of those, 31 percent of the pedestrians were found to be drunk. The bottom line is that the pedestrians must do more to protect their lives as well as the lives of other road users. They can start by obeying traffic signals, using marked cross-walks and calling a cab when they've had too much to drink. What is the pedestrians' selfish reason for traffic jams?",

        "question": "My grandmother was a master gardener. She could make anything bloom  . Even me.  For most of her life, she lived on a farm in the mountains of North Carolina, where she raised four children, buried a husband, and watched the changing of the seasons. After my parents divorced , my dad moved back to the farm. I visited on weekends or holidays. While my dad ate my grandmother's vegetables, I breathed in her flowers. I was a skinny kid, but her flowers filled a thousand hungry places in my soul. When my regular farm tasks were done, I was free to climb the mountain, singing songs and gathering flowers. Sometimes the plants scratched   me. My grandmother would say: \"Beauty has a price. I hope it was worth it.\" \"Yes, ma'am,\" I'd say. \"It was.\" Then I'd scratch some more. I loved gathering flowers on my own. But what I loved best was gathering them with her. I walked behind her like a sponge   with legs, trying to soak   it all up. At the end of the day, we'd sort the flowers and make bouquets  : One for the living room, one for the kitchen, and three for the bedrooms. Even then, as a child, I knew what I needed most from my grandmother was not her flowers, but her time. She's been gone for years, but sometimes, when I reach down to pick a flower or pull a weed, I see her hand, not mine. I thought I'd grow up to be a gardener too. I told myself, someday, when my children had children, I'd be a gardening grandma. Then the grandbabies started showing up, and I discovered I'd much rather chase after them than go digging. The truth is, I'm no gardener. I'm a picker, not a planter. I differ from my grandmother in lots of ways, but this: I will always carry within me a heart she made from her own. They don't need to plant a garden. My children are my flowers. Delight and complete me with a beauty that is worth any price. All I need to do is care for them with time, water them with love, and hope that someday, when they hold their first grandchild, they might see my hand.

        "question": "For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted a personal motto. I wanted a saying that I could really try to live my life by. I mean all the humorous book and storybook heroes always have a personal principle they follow. Good manners! Courage! Keenness! But a part of me could never get myself to create my own motto because I never knew where to start and I never thought I could give one. \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" is a quote by the great writer and philosopher, Voltaire. More familiar, it makes an appearance in the modern day movie performance of the superhero Spider-Man. This saying provides a sense of responsibility for those with actually limitless power. \"Be good to others and others will be good to you.\" is another well-known proverb that has roots in almost all of the major religions. Although it is less practiced today than it is lectured, it is a powerful and good motto to live by. Kindness, in this sense, is the final power in judging every action. My personal motto today has an idea - being efficient. Through my limited knowledge, I have come to find that this is simply the best way for me to give insight about who I am and what I believe in. Efficiency is a quality that everyone desires for, right? Who doesn't want to be able to not only work fast but to achieve great results? To some, it may appear to be a frightening journey. But to me, it means that I have a lifelong journey to improve the methods and ideas with which I come near my tasks. Regardless of what motto you want to live by, I believe that everyone should have one, or two or more. These are all symbols of a perfect story of us, in our own view. And it immediately provides insight to the type of person we were, we are and what we strive to be. We are never meant to be perfect, but it is important to try and live by a belief that will help us reach our potential. All you have to do is know what your excitement is and live by it.

Surprisingly the study, by Cambridge University, found children as well as adults preferred to communicate face to face.More than half of all families said a \"technology-free\" time is important and a third of parents said technology had disrupted family life.The findings led family groups to warn that if parents end up spending more time checking emails and social networks than with their children, it could have a detrimental effect on the home. Amongst children aged 10 to 18, who have grown up with new technology, 38% admitted feeling overwhelmed by the volume of messages.Similar numbers of adults felt the same way, with 34 per cent of 25 to 34 year olds agreeing. Justine Roberts, founder of parenting website Mums net, warned: \"Social media is something we have to keep a watch on because it can eat into your life.\" \"We encourage our members to switch off because otherwise you can't give your kids and husband the time they need.\" She added: \"Websites like Face book and Twitter can be enjoyable and addictive but, like with everything, it needs to be taken in moderation.\" The survey also discovered that 43 percent of children and 33 percent of adults are taking steps to reduce their reliance on messaging, text and networking.But only one in five said they would be reducing the number of text messages they are sending and even less said they will be writing fewer emails.Nearly 43 percent said they have had a cull of their Face book \"friends\" and followers on Twitter in an attempt to cut down on the amount of time spent on the websites.

Looking back, I can see that, when I was only a little girl, he created an English environment by providing me with flashcards,fun English- language toys and even dolls which can sing English songs! My interest in English had certainly been awakened   when I began to learn English at school. Just imagine, he went a step further and asked me to learn New Concept English by myself! I was puzzled and even angry. I could not understand why a father could be so strict with his little girl. All the same, he never gave up and he gently insisted that I follow through with his idea. At first, I read stories with tears and I actually hated them because they were too difficult for me. In the end, I came to love the funny stories and, to be honest, my father was always there with a helping hand. I am sure that my English would never have got so far without his support. And that's why my father is not only my first English teacher but also my lifelong teacher. He is one who awoke my interest, and who gave me much confidence .

But recently, some people have been much more concerned with how the grizzly bear and mountain lion can cross the road.    Millions of animals die each year on US roads, the Federal Highway Administration reports. In fact, only about 80 ocelots , an endangered wild cat exist in the US today. The main reason? Road kill.    \"Ecopassages\" may help animals cross the road without being hit by cars. They are paths both over and under roads. \"These ecopassages can be extremely useful, so that wildlife can avoid human conflicts,\" said Jodi Hilty of the Wildlife Conservation Society. But do animals actually use the ecopassages? The answer is yes. Paul Beier of Northern Arizona University found foot marks left by mountain lions on an ecopassage that went under a highway. This showed that the lion used the passage.    Builders of some ecopassages try to make them look like a natural part of an area by planting trees on and around them. Animals seem  _ . Animals as different as salamanders  and grizzly bears are using the bridges and underpasses.    The next time you visit a park or drive through an area with a lot of wildlife, look around.

        "question": "Sensing phantom phone vibrations  is a strangely common experience. Around 80% of us have imagined a phone vibrating in our pockets when it's actually completely still. Almost 30% of us have also heard non-existent ringing. Are these signs of madness caused by digital culture? Not at all. In fact, phantom vibrations and ringing indicate a fundamental principle in psychology. Psychologists use a concept called Signal Detection Theory to guide their thinking about the problem of perceptual  judgments. Working through the example of phone vibrations, we can see how this theory explains why they are a common and unavoidable part of healthy mental function. When your phone is in your pocket, the world is in one of two possible states: the phone is either ringing or not. You also have two possible states of mind: the judgment that the phone is ringing, or the judgment that it isn't. Obviously you'd like to match these states in the correct way. True vibrations should go with \"it's ringing\", and no vibrations should go with \"it's not ringing\". Signal detection theory calls these faithful matches a \"hit\" and a \"correct rejection\" But there are two other possible combinations: you could mismatch true vibrations with \"it's not ringing\" (a \"miss\"); or mismatch the absence of vibrations with \"it's ringing\" (a \"false alarm\"). This second kind of mismatch is what's going on when you imagine a phantom phone vibration. What does that mean in terms of your phone? We can assume that people like to notice when their phone is ringing, and that most people hate missing a call. This means their perceptual systems have adjusted their bias  to a level that makes misses unlikely. The unavoidable cost is a raised likelihood of false alarms of phantom phone vibrations. The trade-off between false alarms and misses also explains why we all have to put up with fire alarms going off when there isn't a fire. It isn't that the alarms are badly designed, but rather that they are very sensible to smoke and heat and biased to avoid missing a real fire at all costs. The outcome is a rise in the number of false alarms. These are inconvenient, but nowhere near as inconvenient as burning to death in your bed or office. The alarms are designed to err on the side of caution. According to the writer, the sense of phantom phone vibration is_.",

They were more interested in my story of success, such as how I was able to create the nation's largest firm for millions of dollars. That's the story everyone wanted me to write, but it's not the story I wanted to tell. Looking back, I see so clearly how often, throughout my boyhood, I was touched by random acts of kindness that helped shape me into the man I am today. And random acts of violence and ignorance played just a powerful lawyer involves hard work, bur escaping generational poverty is the hardest thing I ever done. I chose to write the story of my childhood years in poverty, with the hope that a child somewhere in the world will read my story and be inspired to break the cycle of poverty.

Less than four months later, the first print run of 5,000 copies were sold out. Today, the memoir is being used by universities, high schools and middle schools, as a case study of the behavior patterns of the culture of poverty as well as valuable lessons on how to succeed in life.

According to the World Federation for Mental Health and the WHO, depression has moved beyond the medical domain  to become a social problem. Statistics from the Beijing Suicide Research and Prevention Center show that of the 287,000 people who commit suicide in China every year, 70 percent are victims of depression. \"This equates to one depression victim taking their life every three minutes,\" cited CCTV recently. According to the Beijing-based Capital Medical University, the number of depression patients has been on the rise in the past years and now accounts for 5 to 10 percent of the population, more than the global average of 5 percent. Wang Shaoli, vice-president of Beijing Huilongguan Hospital, a medical center specializing in mental health, said that what makes depression so widespread is that everybody can get it. \"No one is immune to depression,\" said Wang. \"It has become a social problem because depression kills one's social capabilities, such as communication, and leads to a negative social mentality.\" According to Wang, depression can be treated with medicine and early psychological consultation. The real problem is the lack of awareness surrounding the issue. \"People with mental health illnesses are discriminated against,\" said Wang. \"So they are reluctant to go to hospital and often keep the pain to themselves, which only makes matters worse.\" Only one in 10 depression victims are properly treated in China, according to the Beijing Suicide Research and Prevention Center. \"When people get depressed, it becomes part of their thoughts, making them negative, even desperate,\" said Wang. \"And the ideas are difficult to change.\" That's why Wang suggests early intervention. \"Normally it takes about nine months to treat depression,\" said Wang. \"But in most cases, patients drop treatment half way when they feel some progress.\" According to the passage, which of the following are true EXCEPT  _   ?",

They provide news, information and ideas to the people who read them.They contain links to other websites.And they provide a place for people to write their ideas and react to the ideas of others. A research company called Perseus has studied more than 3,000 web logs. It says that blogs are most popular with teenage girls. They use them to let their friends know what is happening in their lives. The study also says that more than 100,000 bloggers stopped taking part in the activity after a year. However, some people develop serious blogs to present political and other ideas. For example, the Republican and Democratic parties in the southern state of Kentucky recently started their own blogs. And American companies are beginning to use blogs to advertise their products. At thesame time, some long-standing blogs have ended. Last week, blogging leader Dave Winer closed his free blog service \"weblogs.com\". He said the site became too costly to continue.

        "question": "Do you have an emotional brain or a rational   one? Researchers at Australia's Monash University have found actual difference in the brains of people who respond emotionally to others' feelings compared with those who respond more rationally. A study published in the journal NeuroImage has looked at whether people who have more brain cells in certain areas of the brain are better at certain types of empathy, according to Science Daily. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person, and the two types investigated were cognitive   empathy and affective   empathy. \"Every day people use empathy with, and without, their knowledge to get around in the social world,\" said Robert Eres from Monash University's School of Psychological Sciences. \"We use it for communication, to build relationships, and to increase our understanding of others.\" \"People who are high on affective empathy are often those who get quite fearful when watching a scary movie, or start crying during a sad scene. Those who have high cognitive empathy are those who are more rational, for example a psychologist helping someone,\" explained Eres. The results of the study showed that people with high scores for affective empathy had more gray matter in a part of the brain called the insula, found right in the \"middle\" of the brain. Those who scored higher for cognitive empathy had more in a part called the midcingulate cortex--an area above the corpus callosum, which connects the two halves of the brain. The discovery \"raises new questions--like whether people could train themselves to have more empathy, and whether those areas of the brain would become larger if they did, or whether we can lose our ability to empathize if we don't use it enough\", according to Science Daily. \"In the future we want to investigate further by testing whether training people in empathy-related tasks can lead to changes in these brain areas. We also want to investigate if damage to these brain areas, as a result of a stroke   for example, can lead to empathy problems.\" said Eres. Perhaps in the future we will all be able to empathize more with other people. Maybe you will cry at that sad movie after all!

I brought them in and asked them why they came to my house. They told me, \"We need you for something. We would like you to join the band; we want you to be our background dancer. You will also be a dancer for Miley Cyrus.\" Hearing their words, my jaw dropped in amazement. We kept talking for a while.

It is not important how many fish we catch.It is about enjoying the relationship that we have not had for years.I'm 62 and he is 84.When we are on the lake fishing,it is like two kids enjoying life.It is far better to find a way to put the unhappy past behind.I am so lucky to spend the happy time with my father in his last years.Now my heart is filled with love.A smile always graces my lips.

I was in my room thinking of ways to make them sorry when my father came in. \"Want to go for a ride, today, Beck? It's a beautiful day.\" \"No! Leave me alone!\" Those were the last words I said to him that morning. My friends called and invited me to go to the mall with them a few hours later. I forgot to be mad at them and went with them. I came home to find a note on the table. My mother put it where I would be sure to see it. \"Dad has had an accident. Please meet us at Highland Park Hospital\". When I reached the hospital, my mother came out and told me my father's injuries were extensive. \"Your father told the driver to leave him alone and just call 911, thank God! If he had moved Daddy, there's no telling what might have happened. A broken rib  might have pierced  a lung....\" My mother may have said more, but I didn't hear. I didn't hear anything except those terrible words: Leave me alone. My dad said them to save himself from being hurt more. How much had I hurt him when I hurled those words at him earlier in the day? It was several days later that he was finally able to have a conversation. I held his hand gently, afraid of hurting him. \"Daddy... I am so sorry....\" \"It's okay, sweetheart. I'll be okay.\" \"No,\" I said, \"I mean about what I said to you that day. You know, that morning?\" My father could no more tell a lie than he could fly. He looked at me and said, \"Sweetheart, I don't remember anything about that day, not before, during or after the accident. I remember kissing you goodnight the night before, though.\" He managed a weak smile. My English teacher once told me that words have immeasurable power. They can hurt or they can heal. And we all have the power to choose our words. I intend to do that very carefully from now on. The reason why the author's father said he forgot everything about that day is that   _  .",

        "question": "The Internet is full of headlines that grab your attention with buzzwords  . But often when we click through, we find the content hardly delivers and it wastes our time. We close the page, feeling we've been cheated. These types of headlines are called \"click bait\". A headline on Busin,esslnsider.com reads:  \"This phrase will make you seem more polite\". First, when you click through, you find another headline: \"Four words to seem more polite.\" Then, on reading the article, you find it's actually an essay about sympathy. And what are the four words? They're  \"Wow, that sounds hard.\" On some video websites, you might encounter headlines such as  \"Here's what happens when six puppies visited a campus\". Turns out it's just some uneventful dog footage  . Nowadays, with the popularity of social media, many news outlets tweet   click bait links to their stories. These tweets take advantage of the curiosity gap or attempt to draw the reader into a story using a question in the headline. These click bait headlines are so annoying that someone is attempting to save people time by exposing news outlet click bait through social media. The Twitter account @SavedYouAClick, run by Jake Beckman, is one such example. Beckman's method is to grab tweets linking to a story and retweet them with a click-saving comment. For example, CNET tweeted \"So iOS 8 appears to be jailbreakable but...\", with a link to its coverage of Apple's product announcements. Beckman retweeted it with this comment attached: \"... it hasn't been jailbroken yet.\" Since founding the account, Beckman's Twitter experiment has brought him more than 131,000 followers. Beckman said that @SavedYouAClick is  \"just my way of trying to help the Internet be less temble.\" Asked about his goal, he said, \"I'd love to see publishers think about the experience of their readers first.

Just like the Internet was 10 years ago, blogging is popular with an underground culture, that is doing it for love and passion . Blogging is a way of collecting links  to webpages and sharing thoughts and ideas with people online. Blogs are basically online diaries which are created for sharing information and ideas. Dominic, a fifth-grade student, writes: \"The blogs give us a chance to communicate between ourselves and encourage us to write more. When we publish on our blog, people across the whole world can reply by using the 'comments' link. In this way, they can ask questions or simply tell us what they like. We can then know if people like what we write and this will tell us where we can improve. By reading these comments, we can discover our weaknesses and our strengths. Blogging is a chance to exchange our opinions with the rest of the world rather than just people in our immediate environment.\" Blogging is sweeping the Internet. A recent report states that at least three million Americans have created blogs, with similar numbers being seen worldwide. Two years ago, Andrew Sullivan decided to set up a Web page himself and used \"Blogger. com\" to publish some daily thoughts to a few hundred readers. He worked hard at the blog for months for no reward. But the result is that he is now reaching almost a quarter of a million readers a month and making a lot of money. This, at least, is the idea: a publishing revolution  is coming. \"Blogger.com\"  could be  to words what Napster was to music--except this time, it'll really work.

I also love my laptop computer ,as it holds all of my writing and thought .Despite this love of technology ,I know that there are times when I need to move away from these device and truly communication with others.On occasion ,I teach a course called History Matters for a group of higher education managers. My goals for the class include a full discussion of historical themes and ideas .Because I want students to thoroughly study the material and exchange their ideas with each other in the classroom ,I have a rule --no laptop ,ipads ,phones ,etc .When students were told my rule in advance of the class, some of them were not happy . Most students assume that year reasons for this rule include unpleasant experiences in the past with students misusing technology . There's a bit of truth to that.Some students assume that I am anti-technology . There's no truth in that at all . I love technology and try to keep up with it so I relate to my students. The real reason why I ask students to leave technology at the door is that I think there are very few places in which we can have deep conversions and truly complex ideas. Interruptions by technology often break concentration and allow for too much dependence on outside information for ideas . I want students to think differently and make connections between the course the material and the class discussion . I've been teaching my history class in this way for many years and the educations reflect student satisfaction with the environment that I create .Students realize that with deep conversation and challenge , they learn at a level that helps them keep the course material beyond the classroom . I'm not saying that I won't ever change my mind about technology use in my history class, but until I hear a really good reason for the change ,I'm sticking to my plan. a few hours of technology-free dialogue is just too give up. some of the students in the history class were unhappy with   _",

I'm a bit nervous as I've never made a speech before to so many people, so please forgive me if it shows! www.xkb1.com As we all know, this is the school leavers' party, and it's time to say goodbye to everyone. We're sorry to leave you at the end of our junior high school education, and we promise that we'll never forget the happy times we have spent in these buildings with you all. I'd like to thank three groups of people for the three things I've learnt while I've been a pupil at our school. The three things are friendship, love and knowledge. The first group is my friends, and what I've learnt is the importance of friendship. We've worked hard together, we've even shared some difficult times together, but we've also had a lot of fun. Many of us will go to new schools and we may not see each other so often in the future. Others will go on to senior high school and continue their close friendships. But friends don't have to see each other all the time. Sometimes the friends you treasure most are the friends you see less often. A life without old friends is like a day without sunshine. We'll always stay in touch. The second group is our parents and grandparents. We thank you for the love you have shown us during our years at junior high school, for making a home where we feel both safe and relaxed, and where we can prepare ourselves for our school days. We also thank you for your help with our homework. How many of us owe our good grades to the suggestions you have made during those long evenings? And finally, the third group is our teachers. We can never pay you back for your kindness, your patience, and gift of knowledge which you have offered us; sometimes you've made us work very hard. But you have always been fair and you'll always be our role models. There's a saying from Ireland which is a favourite of mine: Strangers are only friends you haven't met yet. I couldn't say it better myself. So from the bottom of my heart, I thank you all and wish you success for the future. Which words can you use to describe the tone?",

With the number of people visiting this place increasing each year, the chances are great that any of us may damage the natural environment along the Trail and affect the experience for others. So please do your part by following these hiking and camping practices, and encourage others to learn about and adopt these techniques. 1 Plan ahead and prepare. Evaluate the risks associated with your outing, identify campsites and destinations in advance, and use maps and guides. Prepare for extreme weather, dangers, and emergencies - especially the cold - to avoid impacts   from searches, rescues, and campfires. Learn when areas are most crowded and try to avoid those times. 2 Dispose of waste properly. Pack out all trash and food waste, including that left behind by others. Don't bury trash or food, and don't try to burn packaging materials in campfires. Use the privy   for human waste only. Do not add trash. If there is no privy, dispose of human waste by burying it in a hole, a hole at least 200 feet (80 steps) from campsites, water sources and shelters, and well away from trails. 3 Leave what you find. Leave plants, cultural artifacts   and other natural objects where you found them for others to enjoy. Do not damage live trees or plants; green wood burns poorly. Collect only firewood that is dead, down, and no larger than your wrist. Leave dead standing trees and dead limbs on standing trees for the wildlife. 4 Minimize campfire impacts. Use stoves for cooking - if you need a fire, build one only where it's legal and in an existing fire ring. Keep fires small. Never leave your campfire unattended, and drown it when you leave. Do not try to burn trash, including plastic, glass, cans, tea bags, food, or anything with food on it. These items do not burn thoroughly. They create harmful fumes  , and attract wildlife like skunks and bears. If you need a fire on the Appalachian Trail, you should   _  .",

Artificial Intelligence Before Minsky, computers were more like calculators, performing math operations at speeds much faster than humans. Minsky was the first to say that computers can one day be as intelligent as human beings. He was so convinced about this, that in 1959, he and his friend John McCarthy invented the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Minsky wrote a book called Perceptrons, describing a particular type of \"artificial neural  network\". Neural networks have made a comeback in a new field of Computer Science called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is used to recognize things and people in pictures (as seen in Facebook and Google Photos), language translation( try Google Translate sometimes), and so on. Robotics, Microscopes and Virtual Reality How many of you have done Robotics at school and loved it? You have Minsky to thank again, for his work on Robotics. One of his biggest inventions was the confocal scanning microscope, an instrument that is still widely used today in medical and scientific research. Minsky was really futuristic. He created one of the first head-mounted graphics displays , which gave rise to the exciting area of Virtual Reality. This year, Facebook is releasing Oculus, a virtual reality headset, which you can use to play games with your friends in a 3-D environment.

'Yes, of course,' the old man answers, 'I will show you the way. Please let me sit in your car. I can go with you and tell you where to turn.' He gets in Mr. Green's car. They drive about twelve miles . When they come to a small house, the old man says, 'Stop here.' Mr. Green stops his car and says, 'But this isn't a hotel.' 'No,' the old man answers. 'This is my house. Thank you very much for driving me home. And I'll show you the way to the Sun Hotel. Turn around and go back nine miles. Then you will get to the hotel.'

        "question": "Humor is a most effective, yet frequently neglected, means of handling the difficult situations in our lives. It can be used for patching up differences, apologizing, saying \"no,\" criticizing, getting the other fellow to do what you want without his losing face. For some jobs, it's the only tool that can succeed. It is a way to discuss subjects so sensitive that serious dialogue may start a quarrel. For example, many believe that comedians on television are doing more today for racial and religious tolerance than people in any other forum. Humor is often the best way to keep a small misunderstanding from escalating into a big deal. Recently a neighbor of mine had a squabble with his wife as she drove him to the airport. Airborne, he felt miserable, and he knew she did, too. Two hours after she returned home, she received a long-distance phone call. \"Person-to-person for Mrs. I. A. Pologize,\" intoned the operator. \"That's spelled 'P' as in...\" In a twinkling, the whole day changed from grim to lovely at both ends of the wire. An English hostess with a quick wit was giving a formal dinner for eight distinguished guests whom she hoped to enlist in a major charity drive. Austerity was a fashion in England at the time, and she had asked her children to serve the meal. She knew that anything could happen--and it did, just as her son, with the studied concentration of a tightrope walker, brought in a large roast turkey. He successfully elbowed the swinging dining-room door, but the backswing threw the bird onto the dining-room floor. The boy stood rooted: guests stared at their plates. Moving only her head the hostess smiled at her son,\" No harm, Daniel,\" she said. \"Just pick him up and take him back to the kitchen\"... she enunciated clearly so he would think about what she was saying... \"and bring in the other one.\" A wink and a one-liner instantly changed the dinner from a red-faced embarrassment to a conspiracy of fun.

        "question": "When next year's crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they'll be joined by a new face: Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost  of Yale, who'll become Oxford's vice-chancellor----a position equal to university president in America. Hamilton isn't the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc. have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it's gone global. Yet the talent flow isn't universal. High-level personnel  tend to head in only one direction: outward from America. The chief reason is that American schools don't tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university's budget. \"We didn't do any global consideration,\" says Patricia Hayes, the board's chair. The board finally picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist  who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a particularlly American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity. Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student numbers. The decline in government support has made fund-raising an increasingly necessary ability among administrators  , and has hiring committees hungry for Americans. In the past few years, well-known schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen \"a major strengthening of Yale's financial position.\" Of course, fund-raising isn't the only skill outsiders offer. The globalization of education means more universities will be seeking heads with international experience of some kind to promote international programs and attract a global student body. Foreigners can offer a fresh perspective  on established practices. What is the current trend in higher education discussed in the passage?",

Challenge Alaska has worked out a national program to give those disabled kids a chance to enjoy the sports they otherwise may not be able to.     Alex thought a simple game of bocce ball   was out of reach before. Alex was hit by a car when he was 5 years old, an accident that left him with a broken body and a mind full of dreams. \"Those dreams are harder to do because you can't move your hands, and you can't move your legs,\" he said.

Henry Loomis was born in 1919 Tuxedo Park , New York. His father was Alfred Lee Loomis , a rich New York City businessman .In 1940, Henry Loomis dropped out of Harvard University to join the United States Navy .He was able to put to good use his knowledge of radar technology that he had learned about because of his father's work .After graduating at the top in his naval  training class, Henry Loomis became a teacher at the Navy's radar training school in Hawaii. By the end of World War Two, Henry Loomis had received many honors for his service, including a Bronze Star and an Air Medal. He left the Navy in 1946 to begin graduate studies. Henry Loomis later moved to Washington, D.C. to begin another part of his career in public service. He held positions in the Department of Defense and other agencies: In 1958, he became director of the Voice of America. During his travels around the world, Mr. Loomis saw that English was becoming an important international language. He believed that it was important to make English easier to understand by listeners of VOA broadcasts whose native language was not English. So Mr. Loomis asked VOA program manager Barry Zorthian to develop a way to broadcast to listeners with a limited knowledge of English: The result of this effort was Special English: The first Voice of America broadcast in Special English took place on October 19th, 1959. Those against his ideas at the time said the Special English method of broadcasting at a slower rate with a limited vocabulary would never work, it was not practical. American embassies  demanded that the program be called off. But Mr. Loomis supported the program. Soon, VOA began to receive hundreds of letters from listeners praising the program. Special English programs became some of the most popular on VOA. We are pleased to say that our programs still are. We can know from the passage that Henry Loomis  _  .",

In the wild, about 9 out of 10 cheetah cubs die before they are three months old. They are food for lions. But these cubs were so lucky that they were saved by their \"heroes\", who brought them to Jane and Ian Craig. The Craigs help save endangered animals at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The Craigs nursed the cheetah cubs back to health -- feeding them with bottles, sleeping with them, and comforting them. They named the cubs Sambu and Toki. But what would become of these cubs? How would they survive on their own? In the wild, cubs stay with their mothers until they are almost 2 years old. During that time, cheetah mothers teach their young how to hunt and how to protect themselves. The Craigs wouldn't be able to find a cheetah mother to teach the cubs. So they turned to a man named Simon King. King has spent more than twenty years studying cheetahs. He gave them a nod of approval when hearing about this, though taking care of two baby cubs would take a huge amount of time. For two years, he would need to have them at his side most of the time. But he felt there was no other choice. And so, when the brothers were one month old, King became their father. The brothers followed King everywhere. If they saw large dangerous and fierce mammals, King would growl at the cubs the way a mother cheetah would have, which was a signal for the cubs to stay away. They learned quickly. King taught the cheetahs to hunt using a toy rabbit as King pulled it around on a rope. With more lessons and training, the brothers began to hunt on their own. King is one proud father now.

Here you may select the one which is most to your taste, and you are even allowed to sample them before coming to a decision. I have often wondered whether some people, who had no intention of making a purchase, would take advantage of this privilege. One day I asked this question of the shop girl, and I learned it was indeed the case. \"Now there's one old gentleman, for instance,\" she told me, \"he comes here almost every week and samples each one of the puddings, though he never buys anything, and I suspect he never will. I remember him from last year and the year before that, too. Well, let him come if he wants it, and welcome to it. And what's more, I hope there are a lot more stores where he can go and get his share. He looks as if he needed it all right, and I suppose they can afford it.\" She was still speaking when an elderly gentleman limped up to the counter and began looking closely at the row of puddings with great interest. \"Why, that's the very gentleman I've been telling you about,\" whispered the shop girl. \"Just watch him now.\" And then turning to him: \"Would you like to sample them, sir? Here's a spoon for you to use. \"The elderly gentleman, who was poorly but neatly dressed, accepted the spoon and began eagerly to sample one after another of the puddings, only breaking off occasionally to wipe his red eyes with a large torn handkerchief. \"This is quite good\". \"This is not bad either, but a little too heavy\". All the time it was quite evident that he sincerely believed that he might eventually buy one of these puddings, and I am positive that he did not for a moment feel that he was in any way cheating the store. Poor old chap! Probably he had come down in the world and this sampling was all that was left him from the time when he could afford to come and select his favorite pudding. Amidst the crowd of happy, prosperous looking Christmas shoppers, the little black figure of the old man seemed pitiful and out of place, and in a burst of benevolence, I went up to him and said: \"Pardon me, sir, will you do me a favor? Let me purchase you one of these puddings. It would give me such pleasure.\" He jumped back as if he had been stung, and the blood rushed into his wrinkled face. \"Excuse me,\" he said, with more dignity than I would have thought possible considering his appearance, \"I do not believe I have the pleasure of knowing you. Undoubtedly you have mistaken me for someone else.\" And with a quick decision he turned to the shop girl and said in a loud voice, \"Kindly pack me up this one here. I will take it with me.\" He pointed at one of the largest and most expensive of the puddings. The girl took down the pudding from its stand and started to make a parcel of it, While he pulled out a worn little black pocketbook and began counting out shillings and pennies on to the counter. To save his \"honor\", he had been forced into a purchase which he could not possibly afford. How I longed for the power to unsay my tactless words! It was too late though, and I felt that the kindest thing I could do now would be walk away. \"You pay at the desk,\" the shop girl was telling him, but he did not seem to understand and kept trying to put the coins into her hand.

The presidents of the two universities delivered excellent speeches at the ceremonies as they used words, phrases or ways of expression that are very popular on the Internet currently. At the same time, graduation speeches by other university presidents were also under the spotlight for the same reason. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by students as they contained many fashionable words today, such as \"floating clouds\" ( meaning \"too small and of little importance to mention\") and \"gelivable\" (meaning \" very helpful\") . In the speeches , these university presidents recalled campus life together with students and finally moved all the audiences. They were very different from the usual run of lectures. Many university presidents have changed their regular manner of addressing graduation ceremonies from an advising and preaching   mode to a more fashionable and funny approach. They try to use those words popular among young people in their speeches. In the past, university presidents' speeches were criticized for being too standard and lacking sentiment. Now , they quote fashionable words in their addresses, reflecting they are starting to adopt more everyday attitudes to students. The use of these new expressions has _ a heated discussion. It focuses on the question of whether university presidents should speak in an informal way at graduation ceremonies. Supporters agree with the new approach.

For example, many believe that comedians on television are doing more today for racial and religious tolerance than people in any other forum. Humor is often the best way to keep a small misunderstanding from escalating into a big deal. Recently a neighbor of mine had a squabble with his wife as she drove him to the airport. Airborne, he felt miserable, and he knew she did, too. Two hours after she returned home, she received a long-distance phone call. \"Person-to-person for Mrs. I. A. Pologize,\" intoned the operator. \"That's spelled 'P' as in...\" In a twinkling, the whole day changed from grim to lovely at both ends of the wire. An English hostess with a quick wit was giving a formal dinner for eight distinguished guests whom she hoped to enlist in a major charity drive. Austerity was a fashion in England at the time, and she had asked her children to serve the meal. She knew that anything could happen--and it did, just as her son, with the studied concentration of a tightrope walker, brought in a large roast turkey. He successfully elbowed the swinging dining-room door, but the backswing threw the bird onto the dining-room floor. The boy stood rooted: guests stared at their plates. Moving only her head the hostess smiled at her son,\" No harm, Daniel,\" she said. \"Just pick him up and take him back to the kitchen\"... she enunciated clearly so he would think about what she was saying... \"and bring in the other one.\" A wink and a one-liner instantly changed the dinner from a red-faced embarrassment to a conspiracy of fun.

Nicola MacFarlane, 41, and daughter Lucy, four, from Portobello, near Edinburgh, were looking for driftwood  on Portobello Beach when they came across an old glass bottle containing a note inside written in _ . Now the family are trying to work out if the letter has managed the extraordinary journey across the Philippine Sea, into the Indian Ocean and through both the South Atlantic and the North Atlantic Ocean's before washing up on the shores of Great Britain. It was written on Chinese Valentine's Day or Qixi Festival as it is more traditionally known, lunar July 7, 2012, so it sent off as recently as six days ago because it followed the modern calendar, which celebrated the occasion on August 23. Nicola was still excited to read about the Chinese love story after having it translated. \"I really do hope that it is from China but even it is from nearer to home, it's still a lovely gesture and an inspiring find. It's a love story regardless of where it came from. Nicola, who runs a beach art business in Portobello, added: \"I'm always at the beach looking for bits of driftwood but I've never come across anything like this before. We knew it was Chinese, but we had no idea what it said.' Unable to read the Mandarin text, Nicola turned to the internet and her Australian friend, Julie Gould, whose daughter attended a Chinese school in Sydney. Several hours later Julie returned with the news that it was in fact a love letter. The translated letter reads: \"Da Hai(Ocean), I hope no-one will get this bottle, as we just wish you can hear our voice, and get your blessing. Today is the Chinese Valentine's Day, we pray that our relationship will last forever and we will have a long happy life together...\" Nicola said: \"It sounds to me like the couple are in love but cannot be together so they have sent the message to tell the world of their love.\" When did Nicola and her daughter come across the message-in-bottle?",

Meanwhile,some safety tips should be followed,enjoying the happiness and excitement the beach offers. The number l safety tip concerns ocean safety:pay attention to Flag conditions posted on the lifeguard stands.Lifeguards post a red flag to warn when the ocean water is dangerous.Take them seriously! Tourists from land-locked regions are particularly easily attracted by the magic of the waves.However,a calm ocean can become risky without warning.Make sure you swim near a lifeguard.Swimming without lifeguard protection is almost five times as great as drowning at a beach with lifeguards. Never swim alone.Many drownings involve single swimmers.When you swim with someone else,if one of you has a problem,the other may be able to get help,including signaling for assistance from others. Don't fight the current.The facts show that some 80% of rescues by lifeguards at ocean beaches are caused by currents.These currents are formed by surf and gravity,because once surf pushes water up the slope of a beach,gravity pulls it back.This can create concentrated rivers of water moving offshore.If you are caught in a rip current,don't fight it by trying to swim directly to shore.Instead,swim parallel to shore until you feel the current relax,then swim to shore.Most rip currents are narrow and a short swim parallel to shore will help bring you to safety.

The pop superstar was taken to the University of California at Los Angeles medical centre last night, and doctors tried resuscitation (,) in the ambulance. He did not regain consciousness and was reported dead about three hours later.     \"My brother, the legendary King of Pop, passed away on Thursday 25 June at 2:26pm,\" his brother Jermaine said, \"We believe he suffered a cardiac arrest at his home, however the cause of his death is unknown until the results of the autopsy   are known.

Jackson's death brought a tragic end to a long decline from his peak in the 1980s when he was music's greatest all-around performer, a uniter of black and white music who shattered the race barrier on MTV. His 1982 album Thriller, which included the blockbuster hits Beat It, Billie Jean and Thriller is still the best-selling album of all time, with over 50m copies sold worldwide. The world famous entertainer had planned a series of 50 concerts in London from 12 July.

Chief Joseph did not want to leave the land. It was holy ground. It contained the bones of his father and mother. But,like his father in earlier times,Chief Joseph knew it would be hopeless to stay and defend the land. There were too few Indians to win a war against the white men. And so in June of eighteen seventy-seven,the Nez Perce left their home in the Wallowa Valley. They left quickly. They were able to take only a small part of what they owned,and just a few cattle and Appaloosa horses. When the Indians reached the Snake River,the water was very deep and ran very fast with melted snow from the mountains. Chief Joseph and his people made boats from sticks and dried animal skins to cross the river. While the Indians were busy,a group of white men came and stole some of the cattle waiting at the edge of the river. The other chiefs demanded that Joseph call a meeting. Two of the chiefs,White Bird and Toohoolhoolzote,spoke for War,but Joseph held different opinion. Some of the young men in White Bird's group were very angry. That night,they rode into the countryside and killed eleven white persons. During all his years as chief,Joseph had tried to keep the peace. Now he saw there was no hope. Although he and his young men had taken no part in the killings,he knew that the white men would blame all of the Indians. Chief Joseph said,\"I would have given my own life if I could have undone the killing of the white men.\" Many Nez Perce fled. Chief Joseph remained,because his wife was about to have a baby. After she gave birth,he and his family joined the others in White Bird Canyon to the south. Joseph wanted to lead the people to safety in the flat lands of Montana. But the United States army quickly sent horse soldiers to follow them. They were extremely tired when they reached White Bird Canyon. An Indian--carrying a white flag--walked forward to meet them.

        "question": "Twenty years ago, Oliver's back injury ruined her childhood dream of becoming a ballet dancer. But the injury led her to t'ai chi when Oliver saw a poster for a t'ai chi class and decided to try the mysterious Chinese sport.\"I was active and could not bear resting in bed and I thought I had to find some way to recover,\"she recalls. She was struck by the beautiful movements and the\"nice, patient instructor--Nelson\", who later became her husband. The couple opened a t'ai chi school in the UK. But they soon found themselves in a bottleneck. So the couple decided to move to China. They taught English in universities and learned t'ai chi under various masters. After years of practice, Oliver found her occasional backaches had disappeared. But three years after moving to China to pursue their dream, Nelson died, bringing her much pain. She thought of quitting, but considering the career in which her husband took pride, she stuck to it. She says her t'ai chi\"family\"-- the masters and students -- also provided great support, including her then tutor Dong Bing. She speaks of their first meeting:\"I had been told that his skill was of a very high level and for some reason I had a mental image of a powerful, big man. But my fellow pointed to a small, thin old gentleman, sitting on the ground. Then a sudden feeling of pleasure hit me. Of course this was exactly the kind of person who would be a t'ai chi master -- the last person you could imagine. His idea is that one should not pursue wealth and fame but should endeavor to be happy and share one's knowledge and wisdom with others.\" Following the master, Oliver now learns to live a simple life -- one perhaps more traditional than many Chinese. She does t'ai chi in the morning , makes kung fu tea for guests and draws ink-wash bamboo paintings. She spends her time outside t'ai chi attending cultural exchange events. Why did Oliver decide to try t'ai chi?",

But he had no idea at the time that 12 - year - old Ray had the ability to become his partner in cancer research. Ray's parents remembered that at age four, Ray surprised them by fixing a broken vacuum cleaner . When he was ten, he speedily constructed the family color television from a kit. Later, he succeeded in assembling  a complex stereo system after two experts had failed to do the job. When Ray was ten, he convinced his parents to buy him a computer. In a short time, Ray was able to do amazing things with the computer. Ray shared his enthusiasm for computers with Dr. Tisman, who used a computer for his research. The two discussed computers and medicine frequently. Amazingly, Ray understood the biology and chemistry related to Dr. Tisman's medical research without any previous instruction. Ray then worked with Dr. Tisman after school. He helped conduct research with the equipment and kept it in working order. The purpose of the research was to test the effectiveness of mixing an old cancer drug with certain vitamins. Ray analyzed patient test results by computer, while Dr. Tisman handled all patient contact. Together, they came up with solid research that helped advance cancer treatment. In 1988, 14 - year - old Ray went with Dr. Tisman to a meeting of the American Federation for Clinical Research(AFCR), where Ray presented their initial research findings. Using terminology  beyond the grasp of most kids his age, Ray told the scientists how the new drug mixture caused fewer and milder side effects for cancer patients. A year later, Ray returned to the meeting to update the findings of his and Dr. Tisman's research. By then, he had become well - known for his devotion to finding cures for sick patients. Stories about him appeared in hundred of newspapers around the world. He appeared on television newscasts and talk shows. Ray continued to spend most free hours working with Dr. Tisman. The two began studying the effects of vitamins on babies inside the womb . However, Ray's main interest remained cancer treatment, and he continues his research today.

        "question": "As more people use smart phones to pay bills and store personal information, strict password security has become more important than ever. A new study shows that free - form gestures - sweeping fingers in shapes across the screen of a smart phone--can be used to unlock phones. These gestures are less likely to be observed and reproduced by others than traditional typed passwords. \"All that it takes to steal a password is a quick eye,\" said one of the researchers of the study. \"With all the personal information we have on our phones today, improving their security is becoming increasingly necessary.\" In developing a secure solution to this problem, the researchers studied the practicality of using free - form gestures. With the ability to create any shape in any size and location on the screen, the gestures were popular as passwords. Since users create them without following a template, the researchers predicted these gestures would allow for greater complexity. The researchers carried out a create - test - retest experiment where 63 people were asked to create a gesture, recall it, and recall it again 10 days later. The gestures were captured on a recognizer system designed by the team. Using this data, they tested the complexity and accuracy of each gesture using information theory. The result of their analysis is that people are favorable to use free - form gestures as passwords. To put their analysis into practice, the researchers then had seven students in computer science and engineering, each with considerable experience with touchscreens , attempt to steal a free - form gesture password by observing a phone user secretly. None of them were able to copy the gestures with enough accuracy. The gestures appear to be extremely powerful against attacks. Though the testing is in its early stage and widespread adaptation of this technology is not yet clear, the research team plans to continue to analyze the security and management of free - form passwords in the future. They believe this is the first study to explore free - form gestures as passwords. They will soon publish their findings. The main purpose of the text is to   _  .",

The following are ideas to help parents understand the sometimes confusing world of the teens. SocialNetworking  Sites: Sites like MySpace and Facebook _ all generations and are a good way for a parent to understand what social standards your teen is living with. There are many ways to help you take part in your child's online activities. You also can be from an onlooker   who keeps a bird' s-eye view of his cyber world to an active member of his social group. MMORPG: Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game comes in the form of games. A child can easily become addicted to   them if no limits are set. To fully understand the attraction behind MMORPG, you can make your own account and character to explore the digital   world. Playing the online games may seem strange at first to your teen, but experience has led me to only positive feedback   from young people who can communicate with adults about their gaming experiences. Text and Instant Messenger: The ways of teenage communication have produced a whole new language, such as \"LOLZ\" (laughing out loud) and \"PSOS\" (parent standing over shoulder). Learning the basic shorthand   of teens can open up a whole new world of communication, not only talking to your teens, but being able to listen on their terms as well. You may just find yourself texting faster and ending your correspondence   with TTYL (talk to you later). To teens, texting anyone looks cool, even Mom and Dad. Email: Emailing your child is easy. This, of course, cannot take the place of face-to-face communication, but it provides another way for your child to reach you. Another benefit is that your child cannot act like he didn't hear you.

Others also provide information on accommodation agencies and other housing organizations. The advantage of using your university accommodation office is that you can get some support if you have a problem. The disadvantage is that they are unlikely to have enough registered landlords to houses all their students. Property papers: Loot and Renting Loot is an important source   of information about private housing for co-renters. The offers are from private landlords, agencies and individuals looking for other co-renters. They also have a website: www.loot.com. The advantage of using Loot is that there are some excellent bargains. The disadvantage is that there is no quality control over the offers. Renting is another useful paper. The offers in this paper are mainly from accommodation agencies. Their website is at www.renting.co.uk. Accommodation agencies The majority of rented accommodation in London is probably advertised through accommodation agencies. The advantage of using accommodation agencies is that: you will have access to a large number of accommodations. A good agent will listen to your requirements and can save you time in looking for the right accommodation. The disadvantage is that they will make a range of charges to potential renters. Noticeboards Around the universities you will find a number of noticeboards where offers of accommodation will be posted. These will either be from landlords or from students. Some universities will also have online noticeboards where students can advertise to other students. Advertisements from students can be an excellent way to find accommodation. However, advertisements from landlords can be problematic. Word of mouth Some of the best housing in London is never advertised but is passed on from one group of students to another by word of mouth. It might be that you can find out about good offers from final year students. However, don't suppose that just because you have found out about housing from a friend it is necessarily going to be better than that found through any other source.

It is always polite to let guests or elderly people at the table taste every dish first. But in the West, everyone has his or her own plate of food. Although there are no strict rules on how to set chopsticks and spoons, there are some things you should never do during a Chinese banquet  . Firstly and most importantly, don't put your chopsticks upright in the rice bowl. Instead, lay them on your dish. The reason for this is that when people die, family members give them a bowl full of rice with a pair of chopsticks sticking out upright in it. So if you stick your chopsticks in the rice bowl, it appears that you want someone at the table to die. Make sure the spout  of the teapot is not facing anyone, as this is impolite. The spout should always be directed to where nobody is sitting, usually just outward from the table. Don't tap on your bowl with your chopsticks. Beggars tap on their bowls, so this is not polite. Also, when the food is coming too slow in a restaurant, you should not tap on your bowl. If you are in someone's home, it is like the cook.

For her drive and creativity in overcoming those challenges, she's been named national teacher of the year.  Principal Waynes Kettler said he's worked with many outstanding teachers in his 22 years as an educator, but Peterson is \"just that one step above anybody I've ever worked with before.\"   Kettler and others at Monte Cristo Elementary School talk about the ways she has introduced the learning from other classrooms into her music program and her creativity in working around things such as the lack of money for new music.  When students were reading S.E. Hinton's novel The Outsiders in their regular classroom, Peterson helped them write a 30-minute play with scenes from the book. Then they chose three Broadway tunes that focused on race, equality and social justice, the themes of the book. Peterson composed two other songs herself after classroom discussions about the play and the book. The honor means a lot to residents of Granite Foils. It's inspiring to know that people from small towns even win national honors. As national teacher of the year, Peterson will spend the more years outside the classroom, as a national and international spokeswoman for education. She said it's essential for schools to offer classes such as art or music and physical education because for some kids one of those subjects is the only thing that attracts them to come back to school day after day.

Each student was given 36 cards, and each card listed a topic that teens sometimes lie about to their parents, The researchers worked through the cards with the teens, learning what things the kid was lying to his parents about, and why. By the end of the interviews, the kids saw for the first time how much they were lying and how many of family's rules they had broken. It was reported that 98% of the teens had lied to their parents. Out of the 36 topics, the average  teen was lying to his parents about 12 of them. The teens lied about what movie they went to, and whom they went with .They lied about how they spent their afternoons while their parents were at work, and something like that. Most parents hear their child lie and think he's too young to understand what lies are or that lying is wrong. They believe their child will stop when he gets older. Many books also advise parents to just let lies go -- they'll grow out of it. But the truth is that kids grow into it.

When children make mud pies and observe ants, it may seem like just fun and games, but the truth is the outdoor play is an important part of growing up healthily. The National Association for the Education of Young Children reports that outdoor play reduces (make...less) stress and restlessness in children and improves their attention. Outdoor play is the perfect way to fight against the childhood's obesity(being fat).Research shows that children who play outdoors are more fit and thin, according to the National Center for Physical Development and Outdoor Play. Children who spend time outside on a regular basis  also have healthier immune   systems. And playing outdoors is a good way to get enough vitamin D. Playing outside enables children to relax , reduces tension and helps them solve problems. When children play outdoors, they learn to share and cooperate (work together) with one another. Kids who feel confident outdoors are likely to become able clever adults. The outdoors is a giant laboratory for learning that improves creative thinking and problem solving. Researchers have found that children learn best when their body, mind and spirit are involved  , and this appears in outdoor play. Outside activities develop all five senses, which create a powerful learning environment. The outdoors also lets children have the chance to explore  , experiment, form questions and create their own ideas about how the world works. Although there are the many advantages of outdoor play, time spent outside has been reduced for many of today's children. Kids today spend much more time in front of electronic media than children a generation   ago. The lack of outdoor play is tied to the childhood widespread obesity. And experts predict that the situation is so serious that this generation will have much trouble when they grow up.

But the relationship between youth's media use and sleep is not so simple, said Michael Gradisar, who authored both that review and the Sleep Medicine meta-analysis. \"Technology use is the new evidence when we are trying to answer 'Why are school-age children sleeping less?'\" said Mr. Gradisar, an associate professor of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. There may be safe limits to technology use, Mr. Gradisar stated. For instance, recent research results indicate that using a bright screen for an hour before bed or even playing violent video games for less than that will not necessarily interfere with teenagers' sleep, he wrote. But longer periods of usage can be harmful to sleep, Mr. Gradisar added. Rather than delaying school start times, he said, the first step should be educating parents about limiting the hours that their children are using technology before bed, and enforcing a consistent bedtime. Early school start times are also commonly blamed for students' sleepiness, especially for adolescents. Secondary schools around the nation and the world have been delaying start times, often with positive results. Mr. Minnich of the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center hesitated to put blame to any particular factor.

        "question": "I bought a Paul Smith shirt three months ago. For those who don't know, Paul Smith is an English designer brand. His shirts cost about 1,000 yuan and upwards. I paid 50 yuan for my colorful shirt from a street vendor in Beijing. Of course my shirt was a knockoff, a cheap copy of the brand. After a few washes, little balls formed on the surface of the thin material. Do I care? Not at all. You get what you pay for. I have to admit I hate shopping. _ I have other priorities. In You Are What You Wear, US writer Jennifer Baumgartner says people's clothes tell a story about their personality. She writes: \"The clothes you choose to wear provide important information about you as a person: your approximate education level, your income, social status and even your level of self-esteem  .\" When I started work as an undercover crime reporter, I had to shop for jeans and a hoodie   in order to fit in with a rough and ready   social group. I bought the hoodie in a charity shop. My daughters were shocked. They thought I looked bad, but I knew my disguise was perfect. Elizabeth L. Cline thinks she knows best when it comes to cheap clothes in her book Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion. She expresses sadness that clothing has been turned into a good that is thrown away after being used once or twice.

        "question": "No opera smells of the sea quite like Britten's Peter Grimes. The music makes us constantly aware of the sea's immensity, it's potential for threat, and the play of light on its waves. But the sea isn't just a special background, it weighs on the lives of the characters, offering them a living, but at a price. In the first act the laboured sound of the strings evokes   the complete heaviness of the sailor's work, as they haul  the boats up the shingle  . Then a storm gathers which rages  through the scene at the Inn, and stirs up an orchestral hurricane. Even when it's calm and favorable, the sea is inescapable. In the comfortable enclosed world of the opera house, this can only be suggested. In the production of Peter Grimes about to open at the Aldeburgh Festival, it will be really present, because the opera is taking place on the beach, the setting for much of the narrative of Britten's opera, and also the poem by the Suffolk poet George Crabbe that inspired it. This won't be the first opera production to be set in the actual landscape in which the action takes place. There's a well-known filmed production of Tosca shot in Castel Gandolfo in Rome, and a production of Donizetti's Anna Bolena was once mounted in the moat  surrounding the Tower of London. But those were manageable urban landscapes, with comfortingly solid buildings to act as wind shields and acoustic blocks. On the Aldeburgh beach there's actually nothing, apart from a few boats, some whole, some wrecked. Here anything more complicated than walking the dog is hard to solve. The wind blows away one's words, so conversation is hard, and anything not tied down tends to blow away. The sliding shingle turns one's steps into a drunken stagger. The idea of performing an opera in these conditions seems quite _ -- an accusation Aldeburgh director Jonathan Reakie takes cheerfully on the chin. Why has he done it? \"Well, Grimes is the opera of Britten's that's most associated with Aldeburgh, but it's never been produced at the Festival which he founded. There just isn't the space for it. In his anniversary year we wanted to focus on Britten's connection with Suffolk, and this seemed the boldest way to do it.\" Having had the mad idea, Reakie found his colleagues were not just accepting, but enthusiastic. \"We spent a long time thinking about ways to do it. One idea we had was to do all the scenes at the right time of day. There's one scene at dawn, another at midday, and a lot of action at night, but that was too complicated. Then we thought about doing a few scenes on the beach. But in the end, we thought hell, let's just do the whole thing.\" Reakie's partners' attitude towards his opera on a beach is   _  .",

More than hard work or education, the best way to get rich in America is to be born rich. It is the case that somebody who is in the upper third of income, poor scores, in the bottom on tests when they are in eighth grade, is more likely to go to college and finish college than a poor kid with the top scores. That's what the working persons'  children are up against. The Economic Policy Institute finds it would take a poor couple with 2 children 9 or 10 generations to achieve middle class status. That's about 200 years. The hallmark   of American opportunity has always been the ability to do better than your parents. But compared with similar developed countries, the United States ranks fifth out of six for so-called intergenerational mobility  . If you look at the mechanisms   for upward mobility that were so readily available 50 years ago, they are becoming out of reach, like plentiful factory jobs with good wages and affordable education and health care. White families are twice as likely as blacks to be upwardly mobile. For most people in America today, _  If you started in the middle-income class, about 40 to 45 percent of what you are making right now is due to the fact that your parents were in the middle-income class. The rest is up to you.

Parents need to be involved in their children's education in many ways.Helping children with homework and studying,going on a field trip,teaching a craft or coaching a child's sports team are all great ways to be involved with your child's education.And don't forget to communicate with teachers -- they need and respect your input.Studies show that children learn more and schools function better when parents and schools work together.It's important to stay in touch with your child's education all through his or her school career. Communities can help children create and achieve new goals.Help with homework, read to a child,coach a children's team,or provide emotional support.Help solve problems and build self-esteem .Kids need role models and advisers can be role models by sharing their experiences and wisdom.

To be sure, you can apply various priority   classes and groupings using SaneBox. What really makes SaneBox worth checking out is its ability to ensure unimportant and low-priority emails don't take up even a second of your day. When you apply SaneBox to your email client  , it spends a good deal of time scanning your entire inbox, including ones you've already read. This helps the add-on determine which emails are most important to you. From then on you'll only see emails that SaneBox determines are must-reads, with all others falling into a \"Later\" folder which you can read at your spare time. Each day --- or however often you want it --- SaneBox will produce a report of all the low-priority emails it has collected for you, like a secretary gathering all the odds and ends for a short daily report. If you find an important email has been flagged as low-priority, you can adjust the settings so it never happens again. SaneBox works with all IMAP, WebDAV and OWA email customers including Yahoo, Gmail, AOL, MS Exchange and others. The program also supports OS X's Mail customers, though it requires a bit of adjusting POP-only email services are not supported.

With his great musical talent, this 17-year-old boy has become a superstar in the music industry. Justin Bieber was born in Straford, Ontario and was raised by his single mother. Bieber learned to play musical instruments when he was very young. In 2007,he took part in a local singing competition in his hometown, and he did it just for fun. He never took singing lessons before but surprisingly he placed second in the competition. Then,with the help of his mother, he uploaded videos of him singing on a website and they successfully attracted the attention of viewers. His videos got popular through word of mouth and some of them have received up to 10,000,000 views. Justin Bieber would have never gotten a career in the music business without his videos. Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, had watched Bieber's videos and he was impressed by the boy's talent. Braun then contracted Bieber and he flew the boy into Atlanta 7 months after the first video was posted. Bieber showed his talent in singing as well as his ability in playing musical instruments. He then got a record deal. In 2009,Justin Bieber released his first single \"One Time\" while he was recording the debut album .The single \"One Time\" tells a story about love. This song had success not only in Canada and the US, but also in the international market. Then he released his debut album \"My World 2.0\"in 2010 and the song \"Baby\" became the lead single.

        "question": "Psychologists  have known that what's going on inside our head affects our senses. For example, poorer children think coins are larger than they are, and hungry people think pictures of food are brighter. Professor Remi Radel wanted to investigate(look into) how this happens -- whether it's right away, as the brain receives signals from the eyes, or a little later, as the brain's higher-level thinking processes get involved. Radel chose 42 students and each student was told to arrive at the lab at noon after three or four hours of not eating on the day of the test. Then they were told there was a delay. Some were told to come back in 10 minutes; others were given an hour to get lunch. So half the students were hungry when they did the experiment and the other half had just eaten. For the experiment, the participant looked at a computer screen. One by one, 80 words flashed on the screen. A quarter of the words were food-related. After each word, the person was asked how bright the word was and asked to choose which of two words they'd seen -- a food-related word like gateau (cake) or a neutral   word like bateau (boat). Hungry people saw the food-related words as brighter and were better at identifying food-related words. Because the word appeared too quickly for them to be reliably seen, this means that the difference is in perception  , Radel says--it's not because of some kind of processing happening in the brain after you've already figured out what you're looking at. \"This is something great to me, that humans can really realize what they need or what they hope for, to know that our brain can really arrange for our motives and needs,\" Radel says. \"There is something inside us that selects information in the world to make life easier.\" The purpose of Radel's research is to let us know    _   .",

Men and women in France are seeking relief using the world's best medicine-----laughter. In the past year, more than 15 laughter clubs have been set up across the country. People of all ages go to release their stress with an hour group laughs. \"People telephoned me and said they have forgotten what it is to laugh. They want to find a place where they can escape all their problems for a while. So they come,\" said 40--year--old Jocelyne Le Moan. She usually takes a class of around 60 people through a series of laughter techniques. Her pupils range from teenagers to 70 years old, but most are middle---aged white collars seeking 60 minutes of relaxation at the end of a busy day. Le Moan takes them through the \"Lion Laugh\"and the \"Laugh Contest\", where participants \"speak\"to each other in different ways. And instead of talking, they break into fits of laughter. At the end there are 15 minutes of \"meditation\", when they lie on their backs and let the laughs burst out of their mouths. \"I love it. It's an experience that has changed my life. Through it I rediscovered the child's laugh inside me,\"Said Romain Jouffroy, 24. \"US President George W. Bush should give it a try. He has lost his laugh,\"she joked . Like Jouffroy, many laughter club members find themselves changed into children again, and why not ? The average preschooler laughs up to 400 times a day. The average adult only a day seven to 15. The physical benefits of laughter are already well--recognized. Doctors say the act of laughing releases good chemicals into the blood--stream, while the quick breathing that accompanies it helps massage the digestive organs and strengthens the heart. \"A full hour is like having your inside go jogging!One finishes out of breath, but feels revitalized(. And on top of that , you've had a laugh,\"said doctor Alexisd' Estaing.And many participants in Paris also emphasize the psychological benefits.

        "question": "During the past Spring Festival, many children may have received red packets from their families. But Xing Pu, a 40-year-old economist, is asking the government to give red packets to every Chinese citizen. Xing suggested the government give out 1,000 Yuan to each Chinese since the government income has increased rapidly in recent years. He said his suggestion would allow everyone to directly enjoy the fruits of the country's economic success, help the lower-income groups deal with rising prices and increase consumption around the country. Recent years have seen the government carry out a series of pro-poor   and pro-rural policies, including increasing spending on public healthcare and calling off the agricultural tax. But the lower-income group still needs more help while being hit hard by an 11-year high in prices and recent snowstorms. Xing said while making the draft, he has borrowed many ideas from practices in countries like the United States and Singapore. Earlier this year, the governments of the two nations offered cash handouts to their citizens as the result of a surplus in government income. As for in China, \"We can even encourage the rich to donate their 1,000 Yuan red packet to the poor,\" said Xing. Although Xing's suggestion has gained wide support among ordinary Chinese on the Internet, many other economists criticized it as unpractical. Even Xing himself admitted he made the suggestion without any careful calculation. But they agreed with Xing's point that the growing economic pie should be shared among the people. \"To better use the increase of money, handing out money is not a solution that holds good for all time. It could be better to improve the public service or cut the price of energy use in daily life,\" said Qiao Xinsheng, an economic professor.

For the Democrats  , the two leading candidates are a surprising pair. The first is Hillary Clinton, 60, the wife of former President Bill Clinton. The second is Barack Obama, 45, a Harvard educated senator  .    It is the first time that the leading presidential candidates for a political party are either a woman or black. The energetic pair has certainly gotten people's attention. But the question remains, is America ready for either one?    It's not a simple question to answer. For the past 220 years, Americans have elected only white males to the nation's highest office. That can hardly be called a tradition of diversity. However, many people believe that 2008 will be the year that this changes.   \"The white men that have been running the country recently have done such a bad job, at home and abroad, that maybe now is the time for a change,\" said Dorian Cool of San Francisco, California.    The polling numbers seem to back up his opinion: 86 percent of Americans say they would vote for a qualified woman. An impressive 93 percent say they would vote for a black man if he seemed right for the job. These numbers are much higher than they were just 20 years ago. They may suggest that Americans are ready to be led by a different type of person.    Still, there is a lot to overcome. Although women represent 51 percent of the American population, there are only nine female governors out of 50. Out of 100 senators, only 16 are women. The numbers are significantly lower for blacks in office.  Since the American Civil War, only two blacks have been elected governor and only three have been elected to the Senate.    Surely both candidates face difficult odds, but never before has there been so much support for either a female or a black candidate.    As Barack Obama himself said, \"There is not a black America and a white America, a Latino America and an Asian America -- there's the United States of America.\" If others share his vision, maybe the United States will end up with a new type of leader.

But the gem cutter assumed that a stone so large could only be glass and refused. It turned out that the gem was genuine and could have been worth close to $3,000,000!  The gem cutter missed his chance to hit the jeweler's jackpot and make history. Would you have made the same mistake then? Will you make it today?   In the decades since its discovery, tanzanite has become one of the world's most precious gemstones. Found in only one remote place on the Earth (in Tanzania's Merelani Hills), the precious purple stone is 1,000 times rarer than diamonds. Luxury retailers have been warning that supplies of tanzanite will not last forever. And in this case, they're right. Once the last purple gem is pulled from the Earth, that's it. No more tanzanite.

        "question": "My Best Enemy Once again, I was in a new school. So was a girl in my class named Lisa. That's where the similarities ended. I was tall and she was small. My thick black hair had been recently cut short into an untidy style. Her natural blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great. I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations. We had a great day that afternoon. Lisa was loved by the whole neighborhood. The bookstore owners lent her fashion magazines; the movie theater gave her free tickets... Soon I was included in her magic world. We slept over at each other's houses and spent every free moment together. Lisa, my first real friend since childhood, helped me get through the rough year of early adolescence  and taught me an amazing and very surprising thing about making friends: that your worst enemy can turn out to be your best friend. The writer and Lisa were similar in the way that  _  .",

        "question": "Have you ever felt tired or had too much stress? Do you know how to deal with them? Here is some advice about these. Learn to relax. Overwork is the main reason why so many students feel tired and stressed. Cut down some of the jobs you need to do each day so that you can only concentrate on the most important things. Leaving time for activities that are relaxing and fun. This might mean reading a good book, listening to the music, going for a walk or taking a relaxing bath. Get a good night's sleep. Getting enough sleep will help you keep your body and mind in the best form. If you stay up late and need to get up early for school the next day, you may not be able to concentrate on the things you need to do. Exercise regularly and eat well. Don't rush through your meals. Eat less junk food or fast food. Eat healthy food instead. Get to know pleasant people. Some people are _ , while others not. Choose optimistic people as your friends and spend more time with them and you'll be as happy as them. Learn to be calm when you face any problem. Find out the best option  from those that are in your mind. Knowing that you are able to solve problems is a good way to build up your self-confidence. Have a happy attitude . Your attitude decides the way you see things. Is your cup half full or half empty? Learn to think more positively  about the difficulties you face. Don't look at the half empty cup in your life.

        "question": "Many parents try hard to protect their kids from TV and Internet advertising. But how can you protect a child from a large fast-food ad painted on her school locker  ? Or a toy ad on the side of his school bus? As school budgets get smaller, a growing number of schools in the US are selling, advertising space on lockers and buses and in gyms or cafeterias. It is an easy way for schools to make money. And ads may provide relief for parents exhausted by making cash donations to support schools. While parents can always turn off the televisions or the computers, they can't keep advertising out of schools. This isn't the first time the issue has come up. For example, a news program for teens has been criticized for including ads in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts. And parents' groups successfully fought a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and ads into school buses. But now things are different. Just last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow companies to advertise in the district's schools. Officials say the plan could provide as much as $18 million for the schools. In St. Francis, Minn., schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their lockers with ads. Time says. Edward Saxton, a teacher in the school, says, \"So far, parents are accepting this as a way to bring in needed money. The money pays for programs like arts, sports and music. Parents don't like to see programs getting cut. Neither do I. Besides, schools are thinking about the effects on kids all the time.\" However, Susan Linn, an educational expert, says, \"Kids have already seen enough ads on TV, in magazines and the products they use daily. School is no place for advertisements at all.\" Readers, what about you? Would you rather help run yet another school fundraiser, or expose your child to ads on lockers and buses? Is keeping ads out of schools worth raising taxes, or increasing your own cash support for school through donations? What does the text mainly talk about?",

        "question": "Many years ago,a French naturalist,the Count de Buffon,wrote some books about natural history.The books were a great success even though some critics did not like them.Some critics said,\"Count Buffon is more of a poet than a scientist.\" Thomas Jefferson did not like what the Count had said about the natural wonders of the New World.It seemed to Jefferson that the Count had spoken of natural wonders in America as if they were unimportant. This troubled Thomas Jefferson.He too was a naturalist,as well as a farmer,inventor,historian,writer and politician.He had seen the natural wonders of Europe.To him,they were no more important than those of the New World. In 1788,Thomas Jefferson wrote about his home state,Virginia.While writing,he thought of its natural beauty and then of the words of the Count de Buffon.At that moment.Jefferson created a new word--belittle.He said.\"The Count de Buffon believes that nature belittles her productions on this side of the Atlantic.\" Noah Webster,the American word expert,liked this word.He put it in this English language dictionary in 1806,\"Belittle--to make small,unimportant.\" Americans had already accepted Jefferson's word and started to use it.In 1797,the Independent Chronicle newspaper used the word to describe a politician the paper supported.\"He is an honorable man,\"the paper wrote,\"so let the opposition try to belittle him as much as they please.\" In 1872,a famous American word expert decided that the time had come to kill this word.He said,\"Belittle has no chance of becoming English.And as more critical writers of America,like those of Britain,feel no need of it,the sooner it is forgotten,the better.\" This expert failed to kill the word.Today.belittle is used where the English language is spoken.

        "question": "Campers Gene and Marie Marsden took pride in being good citizens when in the wild. While driving miles to the Green River Lakes area, they taught their children what they had learned in the bear safety handbook put out by the Bridger-Teton Forest Service. Mr. and Mrs. Marsden did their best to keep a tidy camp. As the handbook had said to hang all food at least ten feet off the ground and four feet out from the trees, they did that and locked their food in their trailer  at night. It was already dark when they went to bed, but they _ the campsite with flashlights, making sure nothing was left out. Following the bear book's advice, they slept a hundred yards from where they cooked their food, and kept the car near their tents, separated from the trailer, which they left up at the other camp. The Marsdens liked having their dog Spike on guard. But on the first night, Spike would not stop barking. When Marie Marsden pulled the tent open and shone her flashlight, she saw a young bear. They all piled into the car and drove quickly down the path, calling out of the window to Spike and abandoning the trailer. They drove to a pay phone and called a Fish and Game Department guard, who identified the bear by the white ring of the fur the Marsdens had seen around his neck. The authorities informed the Marsdens that the bear was a young male that they'd been keeping an eye on. The next morning, the Marsdens heard helicopters circling over the mountain and wondered if it might have something to do with the bear. After spending the night in the public campground, they drove back to their site. Wandering the area in search of clues, Marie came to a stop below a tall tree. She slapped her head and shouted, \"Oh no!\" \"What is it?\" Gene asked. Marie pointed at the ground where Spike's dog food bowl lay upside down. A week after their return home, the Marsdens read the headline in their local paper. \"Bear Killed in Wind Rivers.\" According to the article, the Fish and Game Department had shot the young bear because, having been rewarded for invading  a human campsite, it would likely to do so again. The Marsdens knew they had been lucky in the encounter, yet much to their shame and sadness, they also knew that the bear had not.

        "question": "Because I am extremely vulnerable to both slick advertising and peer pressure, I've been thinking about getting an iPad. But here's the problem: I'm cheap, and the iPad's not. If I'm going to fork over at least $499 for a new device, I want to try it out and make sure it's not just a larger, shinier version of my iPhone. But if I went to my local Apple Store, I'd get to spend only a few minutes testing out the machine. I wanted more time than that, so I rented one for $15 a day from a guy on SnapGoods. The Internet start-up in Brooklyn runs on simple reasoning: there are people who want to borrow stuff - camping equipment, food processors, robot vacuums, etc. - and there are people who have stuff they want to lend. SnapGoods helps these two groups connect over the Web. SnapGoods is one of many sites that have sprung up to facilitate offline sharing. Some sites have a narrow, obvious focus (like SwapBabyGoods.com) while others are more obscure (Neighborhood Fruit helps people share what's growing in their yards or find fruit trees on public land). But regardless of whether the sharing is free or involves a fee, these transactions often come with a stick-it-to-the-man attitude. \"Borrow these things from your neighbors,\" reads one earnest request on neighborrow.com, \"The owner-ship has SAILED!\" All of these sites are encouraging something academics call collaborative consumption - in other words, peer-to-peer sharing or renting. Renting something you don't need to use very often makes a lot more sense than buying it and letting it collect dust in your garage. There's a green aspect as well, since sharing helps cut down on overall use of resources. But one of collaborative consumption's most surprising benefits turns out to be social. In an era when families are scattered around the country and we may not know the people down the street from us, sharing things - even with strangers we've just met online - allows us to make meaningful connections. \"This isn't just about saving the environment or saving a dollar,\" says SnapGoods CEO Ron Williams, who came up with the idea after renting a stranger's motorcycle via Craigslist. \"This is about saving yourself by making informed consumer decisions.\" I'm not sure if I got a thrill when I borrowed Goodwin's iPad, but it did feel good to make a connection. In the end, though, I decided not to purchase an iPad. Sorry, Steve Jobs. I'm just not that into owning things anymore. Which of the following can best serve as the title of the passage?",

I heard my classmates laughing and so I tried to stop them with my eyes. But my good intentions were mistaken. The next morning, my teacher, Mrs. Kamble, told me, \"Ashwini, I've received a complaint about you.\" I was shocked. The girl I was protecting thought I'd been laughing at her. I tried to explain but the teacher refused to hear me out. She punished me by making me stand by the door. I knew I was right. Such punishment to a class topper was simply unheard of. But, slowly, my pride disappeared. Instead of being angry, I understood the other students who have been punished at times. For the first time, I felt humbled  . Three years later, I was in the math class. Mr. Prabhuraman, wrote an equation   -- one he'd taught us the day before -- on the blackboard. \"Anyone who doesn't know how to solve this,\" he said, \"please leave the class at once.\" I knew I could solve only the first two steps.

I prepared myself for a good talking-to  , but Mr. Prabhuraman told me kindly, \"Go back to your seat.\" Today, two decades later, those incidents have made me think.

I'm very fortunate--mine isn't. I pretty much live a regular life, except for people asking me about it all the time, which can get annoying  sometimes. When I was about 4 years old, I asked my mom why there weren't any characters with birthmarks in the books she would read to me. When we went to the library, we realized there weren't any available for little kids. Worse than that, the books available to older kids and adults described characters with birthmarks as unattractive. So I decided to write my own. I based the story on all the real things that happened in my life. But instead of people, the characters in the book are real animals from the Galapagos Islands, including red-footed booby birds  . I picked a booby bird as the main character because the birds have red feet due to a vascular   condition, similar to a human birthmark! It was really tough to get my book published. It took a long time because a lot of publishers refused to publish it. They would say there wasn't a big enough market for a book about birthmarks. But my mom never gave up trying to help make my dream come true. And in 2005, she finally took her own money and self-published \"Buddy Booby's Birthmark\". After it was published, I got letters from readers all over the world. They all shared their stories and thanked me for sharing mine. Teachers wrote to tell me that my book changed the way classmates treated each other and that my book was helping kids to accept and appreciate their differences.

        "question": "Most people want to be successful, but never stop to think what it will really take to get there in their chosen field. If it means going back to college for 2 years of night school, could you do it ? If it means reading a book a week for about 6 months in order to really master a new skill ? If you aren't prepared to do any of those things because they are outside of your comfort zone, then you can forget being succesful. I guarantee you will never reach your goals in life, unless your goals are to be ordinary. The biggest killer by far is the dreaded \" comfort zone \" where most people live in their entire life. And the funny thing is that people just can't wrap their heads around the fact that people who have reached some success get tons of time to just relax, but only because they've earned it ! If you haven't built a successful business, or in some way built a career that allow you so much freee time, then you are stuck in the grinding world of nine-to-five jobs everyone else. So how comfortable is that ? So what can you do about it ? Well, find a way to make something happen in your life--- build a business around your favourite hobby, write a book and publish it, or take a course in stock trading and become an expert at that, working on making enough money to retire. If you don't take massive action that puts your way of your comfort zone, you will never be successful at much of anything. I promise--- and I don't make many promises !

Our story begins not in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic, but rather thousands of miles away in Egypt. It is here, perhaps, that we can find the start of the mystery   of the Titanic, in the year 1910, in the great city of Cairo. One day, a famous professor of Egyptian history called Douglas Murray was staying in Cairo, when he was contacted by an American adventurer. The American had something unusual to offer Murray, something that was certain to thrill him: a beautiful ancient Egyptian mummy case, containing the mummy of an Egyptian queen. It was over 3,000 years old, but in beautiful condition -- gold, with bright paintings on it. Murray was delighted with both the object and the askingprice. He gave the man a cheque immediately. The cheque was never cashed. That evening the American adventurer died. For his part, Murray arranged to have the treasure sent back to Britain. However, it was not long before he learnt more about the beautiful mummy case: On the walls of the tomb in which it had been discovered, there were messages which warned of terrible consequences to anyone who broke into the tomb. Murray was disbelieving of these warnings until a few days later, when a gun he was holding exploded in his hand, shattering his arm. The arm had to be cut off. After the accident, Murray decided to return to his homeland. On the return journey, two of his companions died mysteriously, and two servants who had handled the mummy also passed away. The nowterrified Murray decided he would get rid of the _ case as soon as he arrived in London. A lady he knew named Janet Jones said she would like it, so he gave it to her. Shortly afterwards, Jones' mother died, and she herself caught a strange disease. She tried returning the mummy, but naturally Murray refused it. In the end, it was presented to the British Museum. Even in the museum, the mummy apparently continued to cause strange events. A museum photographer died shortly after taking pictures of the new exhibit, and a manager also died for no apparent reason. In the end, the British Museum decided to get rid of the mummy too. They sold it to a collector in New York. At the start of April 1912, arrangements for the transfer were complete, and the mummy began the journey to its new home. But the New Yorker never received the mummy or its case. For when the Titanic sank, one of the objects in its strongroom was the mummy case. Or so they say.

        "question": "The wombat  is in trouble. Some are dying in bushfires, or being shot by farmers. Others are scratching themselves to death because of a mite  infection. Only 115 of one species - the northern hairy-nosed wombat - remain alive in the wild.  Wombats are endemic to Australia. They are found nowhere else. A wombat looks like an overgrown, stocky guinea pig, covered with thick grey fur and with a wide, flat, broad forehead. Fully-grown adults are about a meter long and about half a meter tall. They weigh about 40kg.  But while their looks are pretty straightforward, people throughout history have found it less easy to understand their behavior. The Aborigines  seem to have mixed feelings about them, According to one story, the wombat once said he was more powerful than the sun. After a competition, however, the wombat lost, and so today hides from shame, deep down in a hole. But another Aboriginal story tells of how wise the wombat can be. He comforts the other animals in the forest, after their friend, a cockatoo, has died, explaining to them all about forest spirits. Wombats are strong diggers, with very powerful front legs and sharp claws, usually used to dig winding holes in the ground for their homes. Yet despite their strong appearance, these animals are struggling to survive.  Many have been suffering a lot from a foreign mite, from foreign foxes, introduced for hunting by the early English settlers of Australia. Because of scratching, scars form over the wombats' eyes and ears, and infections occur, finally causing their death. Its population is so small that the group is becoming inbred . Competition with cattle and sheep for grass to eat, drought, bushfires, as well as dingo and feral dog attacks have all whittled away wombat numbers.   But fortunately, a group of committed volunteers and scientists, working with the local government, has now put up fences to protect the wombats from meat-eating animals, made holes for extra shelter, and is working with zoos to create developing programs. These conservationists are well aware they have little time left. What would be the best title for the passage?",

        "question": "Your dog is as smart as any two year old, according to a new study. Dogs bring much happiness to their owners, and even improve human health. Most two year olds keep us busy in life -- an important part of living a long and happy life. According to Stanley Coren, Ph.D.of the University of British Columbia, our dogs are smarter than we thought. Dr.Coren reviewed many studies to find out that dogs are as smart as 2 to 2.5 year olds. Forget about one word orders -- according to Coren, the smartest dogs can learn up to 250 words. Most dogs understand an average of 165 words. \"The upper limit of dogs\" ability to learn language is partly based on a study of a Border Collie   named Rico who showed knowledge of 200 spoken words, and 'fast-track learning', which scientists believed to be found only in humans and language-learning apes .  Dogs are also great at tricking. During play, they have the ability to trick humans and other dogs in order to get treats. \"And they are nearly as successful in tricking humans as humans are in tricking dogs, saysCoren. Dogs can also count to four or five, which might explain how they know when their toys are missing. Coren explains,\"Their astonishing flashes of smartness and creativity are reminders that they may not be Ensteins, but are sure closer to humans than we thought.\" Animals can do much to keep us happy, health, and protect us from harm. Stories of dog heroes can be found using a simple Internet search. Pets teach us sense of duty, keep us from loneliness, and can help with treatment of the disabled.

        "question": "Normally and naturally, a daughter is more attached to her mother in comparison to her father or other siblings  . The attachment is also due to the fact that the daughter finds it easier to believe in the mother on personal and biological matters at different stages while growing up.  The bonding   between mother and daughter will increase with their being together and going out on excursions. An excursion is a journey to some far-off place undertaken by people. It is not necessary that such a trip be taken on a lavish   scale involving lots of money. It can be as short as an overnight trip to some place to improve bonding.  To surprise her daughter with an unexpected excursion, mother can plan a trip to some local spa without the knowledge of her daughter. She can be ready with baggage packed and wait for the moment the daughter comes back from school. Once in the hotel they can enjoy the night together getting refreshing treatments like massage or mud packs. After relaxing spa they can laze in bed, enjoying favourite food or drink and if possible enjoying nature through the window. After a long period of relaxation, going out for a walk together will improve bonding.  Going out overnight to enjoy walk at the beach, and relaxing at intervals without the interference of any other person can be a great idea of bonding. Being of the same sex, and often having the same set of likes and dislikes, they can spend time on makeup or applying nail polish. The daughter should never forget to thank the mother for the wonderful time they spent together, and the mother should never hesitate to say a few words of praise to the daughter.  Going out for shopping together is a good bonding idea too. It is not essential that lots of money should be spent on shopping. The mother can take the daughter to some shops where she can buy her uniform or some other things. They can jointly enjoy window shopping, expressing love and gratitude for the other.

That 19th century \"American Dream\" motivated   the Gold Rush and gave California its nickname of the \"Golden State\". The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next. People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets. But most, instead, worked as railroad labourers. They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \"the old gold hill\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare. Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley. People poured their energy into the Internet. This new chapter of the American Dream attracted many business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups and seek fortunes in America. Better pay, a nice house, and a rising standard of living will always be attractive. However, the new American Dream is no longer just about money. It encourages Americans to consume wisely to protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and promote social justice. The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become the model of the new American Dream.

This project, called Mars One, aims to send a small group of people to Mars in 2022 and eventually establish a permanent colony on the planet. \"Everything we need to go to Mars exists,\" said Mars One co-founder Bas Lansdorp in March 2014. \"We have the rockets to send people to Mars, the equipment to land on Mars, the robots to prepare the settlement for humans. For a one-way mission, all the technology exists.\" Yet the four astronauts chosen for the trip will be stuck on Mars--forever. And despite Mars One's thorough planning, there are a number of challenges that may prevent the mission from ever taking place. The biggest road block could be the mission's huge cost ($6 billion). However, Lansdorp is confident that Mars One will be able to fund the project by selling the broadcast rights for the mission and subsequent experiences living on the planet. Those broadcast rights will also play a part in helping to select the people who will be sent to Mars. Lansdorp said the company will hold a selection process similar to a reality show. Lansdorp is expecting at least 1 million applications from people around the world. In addition to the cost, several other potential problems could inhibit   the mission to Mars. \"It's even more challenging to send people there with life support, with food, with air, with all the other things like books, entertainment, means of communication and of providing for their own resources for a long stay on Mars,\" said Adam Baker, senior lecturer in space engineering at Kingston University in London. \"The size of the rockets you'd need to do this would be absolutely _ \" Which of the following is an appropriate title for this passage?",

It is unusual now for father to pursue his trade or other employment at home,and his children rarely, if ever,see him at his place of work.Boys are therefore seldom trained to follow their father's occupation,and in many towns they have a fairly wide choice of employment and so do girls.The young wage-earner often earns good money,and soon acquires a feeling of economic independence.In textile areas it has long been customary for mothers to go out to work,but this practice has become so widespread that the working mother is now a not unusual factor in a child's home life,the number of married women in employment having more than doubled in the last twenty-five years.With mother earning and his older children drawing substantial wages father is seldom the dominant figure that he still was at the beginning of the century.When mother works,economic advantages accrue,but children lose something of great value if mother's employment prevents her from being home to greet them when they return from schoo1.

        "question": "I'd like to share a little story with you about something that happened when I was four. I remember it clearly. Our loving family dog was nearing the end of his life. My father picked him up and put him in a little bed we had made for him. Our dog, my companion, whom we had cared for, bit my father when he attempted to help him. How could he? Why? I couldn't understand it. I didn't like him anymore. I hadn't thought about that story for a long time but something that happened last week brought it back to me. I went to speak with a friend. When I knocked on the door, I met in an instant an angry look and a few harsh words. When the door was slammed in my face, I stood there shocked, and in a rush, I was reminded of my dog bit my father 20 years ago or so. What brought that story back was that same feeling of betrayal. Both stories taught me something the next day. You see, when I got up in the morning and was told my dog had died, it became clear to me that he must have been in great pain. For him to have bitten a family member, he could not have been himself. Much the same for the other story when I learned that my friend's wife had just left him. We are all beings of our environments, our opinions and feelings. And all of those things can cause you to say and do things that can't be understood by those who are not in the same situation with you. If you meet someone either behaving out of character or acting in a way that doesn't seem to fit the situation, put out your hand and be patient when you think it is least possible for him to do so. You may turn around a story that has a sad ending simply by your actions. What's the author's advice to us?",

In the worst case  it can make one's mind go back and forget what one ought to say,  or to act. Actors, musicians, dancers, lawyers, even radio show hosts  have suffered from stage fright at one time or another. Diana Nichols is an expert in helping people free from stage fright at a medical centre in New York City. She helps actors learn to control themselves. Miss Nichols says some people have always been afraid to perform before the audience. Others, she says, develop stage fright after a fearful experience. She offers them ways to control the fear. One way is to smile before going onto the stage. Taking two deep breaths also helps. Deep breathing helps you get control of your body. Miss Nichols persuades her patients to tell themselves that their speech or performance does not have to the perfect. It's all right to make a mistake. She tells them they should not be too cautious while they are performing. It is important that they should continue to perform while she is helping them. After each performance, they discuss what happened and find out what advice helped and what did not. As they perform more and more, they will fear less and less as much as 50%. Miss Nichols says the aim is only to reduce stage fright, not to _ it completely. This is because a little stage fright makes a person more cautious, and improves the performance.

First, it is very cheap to buy a bike, and it is quick, too. You often need to wait for a bus for half an hour. When the bus comes, there are so many other buses and cars on the roads, so the bus moves very slowly. I travel to work by bus for about four years. I often arrive at work late and feel tired. Then one day, a friend of mine says, \"I go to work by bike. Why don't we travel together?\" \"Because my bike is old, and there are so many buses and cars on the roads. I'll feel frightened.\" I answer. \"Don't be afraid, if you follow me and we ride slowly, you'll be fine.\" he says. Later, I buy a new bike. We go slowly, but we arrive at work quickly.

For instance, nearly 600 local foster kids changed families every year, and they carried their belongings from one home to the next in black garbage bags. Noah, then ten, couldn't imagine squeezing his clothes, favorite toy, and soccer ball into a trash bag and dragging it to a new house in the middle of the night. \"Packing kids' belongings into garbage bags is like telling them that their stuff has no more worth than trash,\" says Noah. So with help from his parents and younger sisters, Macy, then nine, and Molly, then seven, Noah began to collect suitcases and duffel bags from friends and extended family; he received more than 100 bags in less than two weeks. He then sent letters to churches and put ads in local newspapers and on radio stations asking for donations. Within a few months, the family was collecting about 500 bags a week, which they stored briefly in their spare bathroom and downstairs hallway before giving them to foster care caseworkers at the Department for Community Based Services. In addition to suitcases, Noah now provides foster kids with backpacks containing shampoo, soap, a journal, and a toy--all donated. \"My hope is that by giving the children things that are just theirs, they will feel a little control in the midst of the chaos,\" says Noah. Noah's group, A Case for Dignity, collects and distributes hundreds of bags a year. He recently convinced foster care managers from 15 Kentucky counties to pledge to use his bags instead of trash bags. \"I've been so inspired by him,\" says his mom. \"If a ten-year-old can see a problem and create a solution, how much more can we do as adults?\" What is Noah like based on the text?",

Readingat Risk is a survey of national fashion in adult literary reading. The data source for Reading at Risk is as reliable and objective   as any such survey can be. The key results of the survey are presented in the \"Summary\", but the report can be further explained as: literary reading in Americais not only declining rapidly among all groups, but the rate of decline has been speeded up, especially among the young.Readingat Risk merely shows a great _ that most Americans have already noted - our society's great turn to electronic media for entertainment and information.      Reading a book requires a degree of active attention and devotion. Indeed, reading itself is a progressive skill that depends on years of education and practice. On the contrary, most electronic media such as television, recordings, and radio make fewer demands on their audiences, and indeed often require no more than passive participation. While oral culture has a rich reality and electronic media offer the considerable advantages of variety, print culture affords irreplaceable forms of focused attention and thought that make various communications and views possible. The decline in reading, therefore, equals a larger retreat   from participation in public and cultural life.      What is to be done? There is surely no single solution to the present problem, just as there is no single cause. The important thing now is to understand thatAmericacan no longer take active and devoted reading for granted.      Readingis not a timeless, common ability.

Since its beginning in 1980, the Edmonton Folk Music Festival has been commemorating   the true feeling of what folk music is all about and that's the traditional togetherness that is felt when people gather to share stories and feelings through song. This year will be the sixth year when volunteer Riedel will be offering up her time to the festival. \"People coming off a busy spring and summer have a moment of relaxation,\" Riedel said. \"It's really easy to relax, and it's great seeing family and friends have fun together.\" These families and friends come from all different kinds of musical tastes. People who take pleasure in Blues are there, so are people who love Bluegrass. This festival does its best to develop everyone's musical interests. With so many years of experience, the festival has become a well-oiled machine, and does whatever it can to make attendees feel as comfortable as possible. There are free water stations throughout the venue   for people to fill up their travel cups. When people buy food, reusable dishes are given a $2 plate fee, but that is returned when the plate is brought back. The festival has completely sold out of tickets, and in record time. But with big names such as Van Morrison and Jakob Dylan, it's easy to see how that was going to happen. There is no parking area during the festival, so using the Park & Ride system or Edmonton Transit is highly recommended. A bike lock-up area is provided and will be available Thursday until Sunday one hour before the gates open until 45 minutes after the gates close.

While Asian teens may think that their colorful fake braces are cool, experts say that these trendy fashion braces can cause illness and can even lead to death.

Do you know the name of this famous lake? It's called the Dead Sea. It's called this because no living thing could live there. The water is almost dead, compared to what happens with \"living water\". When you think of the term \"living water\", the image that comes to mind is a rushing river that is flowing. It's filled with life and movement. It doesn't just \"receive\", but is also \"giving\" simultaneously. Many of us believe that we need to receive more of something in order to be happy. Whether what we desire is money or something else, we think we need more of it in order to be fulfilled. As a result, we begin to operate in fear and therefore don't give anything because we're afraid that we won't have enough. The result? Like the Dead Sea, we become lifeless. Life is meant to flow. when a pool stops flowing, it becomes stagnant . Stagnant water breeds disease and death. It can't breathe. It can't receive any more. If nothing is flowing out, there's no room for anything else to come in. The solution? Give. As you give, you'll receive. It's a universal law. You see it at work everywhere. we've somehow been deceived (  )into believing that if we don't give, we'll have more. Or we're afraid that if we do give, we won't have anything left.

        "question": "Once I complained to my husband that he wasn't helping enough with our daughter, and I gave him a long list of the parenting chores   I was shouldering on my own. \"But you like doing all that stuff,\" he said. I thought about that while reading a new study about the responsibilities of parenting. Researchers asked 191 college professors, both men and women, who had children 2 or younger, the pleasure they experienced from childcare. On 16 out of 25 childcare tasks--like taking a child to the doctor or buying clothes for a child--women reported statistically higher levels of enjoyment than men. The only parenting issue that gave women less pleasure than it gave men was having to manage who does what for the child. On the whole, women's scores were 10 percent higher than men's. Women are also far more likely to take advantage of family-leave benefits to care for children. In the study, all the universities offered paid family leave, and 69 percent of the women took it, while only 12 percent of the men did. In Sweden, where family leave for both parents is particularly generous, men use about 20 percent of the 480-day benefit. Women use nearly all of it. It's difficult to know how cultural and economic pressures or biological functions influence parenting. Plenty of men change diapers  , and studies show that mothers and fathers alike spend more time with children than they used to. Men have more than doubled the time they spend on childcare since 1985. Yet women still spend twice as much time with the kids as men, says the University of Maryland sociologist John Robinson. Notably in the study, the parenting activity that gave men the most pleasure (and women, too) was playing and talking with their kids. But when men were asked to rate how often they actually did those things, their scores were about 10 and 40 percent lower than women's. In the end, perhaps the issue is not that mothers are doing too many childcare tasks--my husband was right when he said I liked being a mother--but that men, for all their progress as fathers, are still missing out.

In the computing room, 30 students with sleepy eyes, sit still at their desk, beating the dirty and worn keys. Staring at the colorful screen, they tap continuously for hours. For the other parts in the world, it might be in the middle of the night, nevertheless here time represents nothing. It is an entirely enclosed field. These young computer \"hackers\" are tracing a sort of stimulus  , a drive so exciting and absorbing that it ignores nearly anything else in their lives and becomes the focus of their being. They are addicted   computer programmers. Some of these students have been glued to the console   for no less than twenty hours even with no break for meals or rest. Some have been sleeping on sofas and chairs in the computing room, trying to struggle for a few moments' rest but hating to get too far away from their addicted machines. It is not necessary for most of these students to be at the computing room in the middle of the night. What they are working belong to no assignments. They remain there because they desire to be -- they can not resist the attraction of the computers. Furthermore, they are in groups instead of being alone. There are hackers at computing rooms all over the country. In the unimaginable way, they focus on nothing but computer. They escape from schooling and live beyond friendship; they might have difficulty being employed, choosing to travel from one computing room to another. They may even give up personal health. \"There is one hacker in my memory. We actually had to lift him away from his chair to feed him and arrange him to rest and sleep. We truly worried about his health,\" says a computing science professor at California University. Professors of computer science are nowadays paying more attention to this hacker phenomenon and are on the watch for future hackers and more and more severe computer addicts.

One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He had his wisdom teeth removed. The young man then asked me why I always seemed to be so cheerful. \"I choose to be cheerful.\" I said. Then I told them a story. In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where I live. One day I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again. So I left my car there and marched down the road to the college. As soon as I got there I called AAA  and arranged for a tow truck   to meet me at my car after class. The secretary in the office asked me what had happened. \"This is my lucky day.\" I replied, smiling. \"Your car breaks down and today is your lucky day?\" She was puzzled. \"What do you mean?\" \"My car could have broken down anywhere along the freeway but it didn't.\" I replied, \"Instead, it broke down in the perfect place: off the freeway, within walking distance from here. I'm still able to teach my class, and I've been able to arrange for the tow truck to meet me after class.\" The secretary's eyes opened wide, and then she smiled. I smiled back and headed for class.

He makes enough money to buy a cell phone that permits him to visit websites. He says every average person has a cellphone. He likes having one because he can talk to his family when he is away from home. And, he is especially pleased that he can use it to listen to music. It is known as a feature phone . That is because it is cheaper and cannot perform as many actions as more advanced phones like the Apple iPhone. These devices make up the majority of cell phones sold around the world. They have proven more successful in places like Indonesia, where some smartphones cost 700 dollars or more. Although many lower-income users are new to smartphones, they are quickly learning to use the technology. Cell manufacturer Nokia offers a service called Life Tools. For a small monthly payment, the company sends text messages to farmers. The messages tell of weather conditions, crop prices, agricultural news and give other advice. Local businessman Aldi Haryopratomo has developed a way for small store owners to sell things like prepaid cellphone minutes and life insurance through text messages. Ruma is the company that developed the technology. The company is working on a system that will _ people about jobs in their area.

That's the question that David Sarno seeks to answer. \"It's very common for people to say, 'Why do I need a library when I've got a computer?'\" said Pam Sandlian-Smith, director of the seven-branch Rangeview, Colo. , Library District. \"We have to reframe what the library means to the community.\" In the struggle to stay important-and ultimately  to stay open-libraries are reinventing themselves in ways unimaginable even a few years ago, preparing for a future in which most materials can be checked and read from a home computer, smartphone or electronic reading device. But not all library professionals are enthusiastic about the community-building efforts. Sandlian-Smith and others like her have taken: \"If you want to have game rooms and pingpong tables and God knows what-poker parties-fine, do it, but don't pretend it has anything to do with libraries,\" said Michael Gorman, a former president of the American Library Assn. \"The argument that all these young people would turn up to play video games and think, 'Oh by the way, I must borrow that book by Dostoyevsky'-it seems ridiculous to me.\" Sarno reports that lending books is taking a back seat as libraries diversify their holdings-DVDs! E-books! -and struggle to define how they can serve their local communities. And yet libraries can also serve a wider audience; some are bringing rare archival  materials online.

When she and her husband recently checked into Blu Hotel in Zurich, a clerk asked them to sign the dotted line on a room rate hundreds of dollars higher than their online offer. \"It was not a cheap stay,\" says Williams, a lawyer from Billings, Mont. But it became more of one after her husband fired up the Booking.com app he'd used to book their room on his smart phone. \"As soon as we showed him the cost, he honored it,\" Williams says. Technology may create challenges for travelers but it can also solve them. It's more than making sure of a hotel cost. The latest Booking.com can help users select hotels by location, make a secure booking and view the confirmed   cost so they never need to re-discuss their hotel price. Another pain point for travelers is traffic that eats away precious vacation time. There's a new app called Commute which is aimed at users who have to make the same trip every day. But if you're headed to Los Angeles or Honolulu, where visitors can easily get stuck in hours of heavy traffic, Commute can help. Just input basic information about your destination and expected leaving time, and the app will start sending you traffic information 15 minutes before you leave. Testing Commute proved to be a challenge for me, because my home address is about 900 miles from my place of work. But if you have only a short distance to travel through a heavily populated area, you can use Commute to avoid traffic jams. Another source of travel-related problems is money. That's particularly true when you're dealing with a foreign currency. The latest Travel Money Tracker helps travelers prevent currency mix-ups. It immediately changes a country's native currency to yours, so you know exactly how much that Espresso   in Milan costs in dollars. It can also warn you when you're overspending, which can sometimes be a problem when you're on vacation. The only catch, of course, is that you have to remember to record all your purchases. Taken together, these apps solve some of the most common travel problems. But not all of them. Some things, no smart phone can fix, which means I get to keep my job - for now at least.

First, I want to tell you how proud we are. Getting into Columbia is a real testament of what a great well-rounded student you are. You should be as proud of yourself as we are. Your college years will be the most important of your life. It is in college that you will discover what learning is about. This will be the period where you go from teacher-taught to master-inspired, after which you must become self-learner. So do take each subject seriously, and even if what you learn isn't critical for your life, the learning skills you acquire will be something you will cherish forever. Follow your passion in college. Take courses you think you will enjoy. Don't be trapped by what others think or say, but make up your own mind. Most importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life. Pick a few friends and become really close to them - pick the ones who are genuine to you. Don't worry about their hobbies, grades, looks or even personalities. Start planning early - what would you like to do? Where would you like to live? What would you like to learn? I think your plan to study fashion is good, and you should decide where you want to be, and get onto the right courses.

        "question": "People in Shanghai can quench their thirst with high quality water if the Shanghai Water Authority (SWA) is able to make good on its word. It has vowed to make the city's water match its status as a world class city. \"The current tap water quality meets national standards, but, compared with that of the European Union and the United States, it still needs to be improved.\" said the SWA's director general, Hang Jiayi. In other developed countries, water fountains can be found almost everywhere--people do not bother with bottled drinking water. By 2020, the water of the Huangpu River will be treated to reduce the amount of organic waste in it. Major water works that draw water from the Huangpu will need more treatment facilities to improve the colour, texture, ammonia and nitrogen content before 2010. These treatment facilities are expected to cost 4 billion yuan, something that could affect the price of water, according to Chen Yin, SWA's deputy director general. Chen said that replacing water pipes was also a key project. The city's aged pipes are mostly to blame for the bad water quality. The SWA has started the water facilities renovation work, including the more than 14,000 kilometres of indoor piping, 107,000 tanks on top of the buildings, and more than 6,000 underground facilities. World Water Day came on March 22, and this year's theme is \"Water for the future\". Beijing is also drawing up plans during China's Water Week, which runs until March 28. By 2010, the water for the Shanghai EXPO is to be above World Health Organization standards. And, the people of Beijing will be able to drink their tap water as well.

Until the early 1950s, most scientists thought the body and brain rested during sleep. Then a scientist watched people sleep. He noticed that during periods of between 5 and 30 minutes each, sleepers' eyes made rapid movements, as if they were watching something. He called these periods REM sleep, for Rapid Eye Movement. Periods when sleepers' eyes did not move he called non-REM sleep. Whenever the scientist woke people during REM sleep, they were having vivid dreams. Measurements showed that sleepers' pulses went up quickly during REM sleep. Their breathing, heartbeat, and the blood going to the brain also increased. Far from being a time of rest, REM sleep is a time when the body is hard at work. Scientists still don't know the reason for this. Some believe REM sleep makes learning easier. Babies spend a lot of time in REM sleep. Because of this, some scientists believe that REM sleep helps the brain grow. Others think REM sleep is a time for the brain to empty the day's garbage. One thing all the scientists agree on is that sleep is necessary. Without enough sleep, people make mistakes. Most major car accidents happen during the early morning hours, when people are sleepiest. What is the main idea of the article?",

One such thing I remember happened when I was 10 years old. I decided to ride my bicycle over a near-by stream. I carefully planned the adventure, and asked my friends to go there and have a watch. This was going to be my moment! I started riding down the hill, picking up speed and then pulled up on the   at the precise moment and landed face-first into the muddy stream! That painful moment is one that I will never forget. As long as I live, I will remember the pain and embarrassment at that moment.

I have memories that I gladly remember, like what happened today. I had my first conversation with my son today. It was not anything . It was a simple connection between father and son. It was one of those bonding moments that you can't plan or force. They just happen on their own. I was walking into the living room where my son sat in bed watching television attentively. Then he looked up at me and pointed to the television and   something. I asked him if he was watching   and he nodded his head and said,\"Yes\". It was at that moment that his eyes lit up and it was as if we both realized we had communicated. And how happy I was! Sure, at eighteen months, he probably did not realize what communication was like, but his joy at that moment was evident. It was a moment I will remember all my life. Good or bad, memories can last a lifetime. As for an unpleasant memory, though we can't forget it we can get lessons from it and it is like a mirror that will warn us against making such mistakes again.

        "question": "Hundreds of Chinese officials are to be sacked or demoted  for their part in a vaccine scandal that has added to discontent at poor oversight of food and drug safety, especially relating to children. Xinhua, the state news agency, said late on Wednesday that 357 officials are to face punishment, with 192 criminal cases already filed and 202 people detained after improperly stored or transported vaccines were sent to 59 health institutions. This is the latest in a string of food and drug safety scandals in a country where parents often import products for infants and babies from overseas to ensure quality. Many remember with fear the 2008 milk powder scandal, in which infant formula laced with melamine caused at least six deaths and 300,000 children to fall ill. Beijing last month made public an illegal operation in eastern Shandong province in which a hospital pharmacist and her daughter traded $88m in vaccines that may have been compromised because they were expired or improperly stored or transported. The China Food and Drug Administration said, however, that the vaccines posed no greater than the normal risk to patients. \"We don't see that the vaccines' effectiveness has been reduced,\" added the health watchdog in a report. Nonetheless, health officials fear a backlash against Chinese-manufactured vaccines, which already have a reputation for being more dangerous than those made overseas.  Wang Yuedan, deputy director of Peking University's immunology department, said the key to evaluating risks is to check whether package seals are broken or for pollution with micro-organisms. \"The vaccines in the Shandong case don't have those problems,\" he said. Those vaccines had been subject to higher than normal temperatures that could have lowered their effectiveness and reduced their protective value. But the official investigation showed the vaccines \"are still effective\", he said. Beijing, which publicized the affair almost a year after it was exposed, and several years after it started, appeared eager to show commitment to crack down on abuses by announcing the action, political analysts said. The CFDA said a system was being set up to track vaccines from production to use. The World Health Organization warned the scandal could endanger China's public health gains if parents become distrustful of vaccines. It also expressed confidence in Chinese vaccines, saying public immunization campaigns had erased polio  and sharply reduced cases of hepatitis B and measles.

But a growing body of research is raising questions about how a child's lie is different from an adult's lie, and how the way we _ changes as we grow. \"Parents and teachers who catch their children lying should not be alarmed. Their children are not going to turn out to be abnormal liars,\" says Dr. Lee, a professor at the University of Toronto and director of the Institute of Child Study. He has spent the last 15 years studying how lying changes as kids get older, why some people lie more than others as well as which factors can reduce lying. The fact that children tell lies is a sign that they have reached a new developmental stage. Dr. Lee conducted a series of studies in which they bring children into a lab with hidden cameras. Children and young adults aged 2 to 17 are likely to lie while being told not to look at a toy, which is put behind the child's back. Whether or not the child takes a secret look is caught on tape. For young kids, the desire to cheat is big and 90% take a secret look in these experiments. When the test-giver returns to the room, the child is asked if he or she looked secretly. At age 2, about a quarter of children will lie and say they didn't. By 3, half of kids will lie, and by 4, that figure is 90%, studies show. Researchers have found that it's kids with better understanding abilities who lie more. That's because to lie you also have to keep the truth in mind, which includes many brain processes, such as combining several sources of information and faking that information. The ability to lie -- and lie successfully  -- is thought to be related to development of brain regions that allow so called \"executive functioning\", or higher order thinking and reasoning abilities. Kids who perform better on tests that involve executive functioning also lie more. It can be inferred from the passage that  _  .",

Although they made a modest living for their family of 10, they insisted on sharing with those less fortunate. Half a century later, Mrs. Cooper became a beloved volunteer at the San Diego Food Bank, where she devoted herself to helping others. She organized and ran a distribution center from a church, helping it become the organization's largest emergency food distribution center in San Diego. She was one of 25 outstanding senior volunteers in the nation selected and invited to Washington D.C. to receive the award. \"She was the main person who helped us make that program grow,\" said Mike Doody, former director of the Food Bank. \"She had a way of getting people to work together and to work hard. She was determined and stubborn, but in a good way. She had a good heart.\" People knew her as \"Grandma\" because of her selflessness and her devotion to helping hungry children and families. \"She reminded people of their Grandma.\" Doody said.

Some people choose the team of their hometown, or where they now live, or the team that their parents or their friends follow.[:ZXXK] A boy student from Oklahoma wrote a letter to each of the owners or presidents of the 32 NFL teams. He would see what answers he got, and then choose his team. Bill was home from school sick. It was the week before Christmas. He was \"kind of bored\" and needed something to do. So he asked his parents if he could write to every professional football team. Bill wrote the 32 letters by hand. \"We weren't quite sure what we could get back. He didn't really have one team that he wanted to hear from,\" his mother said: \"He just wanted to see what kind of reply he' d get.\" A letter to the Carolina Panthers' owner Jerry Richardson was one of those posted. Bill wrote in his letter, \"My family and I love football. They are fans of different teams.But I don't have a team to cheer for yet. I am ready to pick an NFL team to cheer on for lifetime!\" A few weeks later, Bill's mother was pulling into her driveway when a delivery man arrived with a box from the Panthers. When Bill came home, he excitedly opened the box. Inside he found a signed Carolina Panthers helmet as well as a handwritten note from Jerry. The team owner had written to Bill, \"We should be honored if our Carolina Panthers became your team. We would make you proud of your joining us.\" Bill was overjoyed with what he got. He decided that from then on he would support the Panthers. He keeps the letter from Jerry in his bedroom. His mother says, \"It's not the helmet they sent us. It's what they told us.\" That is what mattered to Bill and why he chose to become a Panthers' fan. Bill wanted to choose a football team to support because  _  .",

Most people read only the sports pages, the advice or the gossip columns, the comics, and perhaps the classified advertisements. Most people don't take the time to read the real news. They attempt to catch the reader's interest with pictures and exciting headlines. These techniques are used on the front page because it is the first thing you see when you pick up the paper. The first page attracts attention and encourages the reader to look through the rest of the paper. This is why editors always look for a good first page story and headline to make them stop and look. If the headline is horrible enough or frightening enough or wild enough, perhaps they will go on to read the front page anymore. They may read the headlines, but that is all, then they turn to the sports page, or comics, or advertisements. It seems that people do not want the news from a newspaper anymore. They say they get the news on the television now.     More people watch television news because it is easier and more interesting than reading a newspaper. What about you?

However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine  _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment  plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil's most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most TV series are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities. \"Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction , they describe middle and upper class values-----not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,\" says Martine. \"They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package.\" Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers. \"This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and showed that consumption was in contradiction with unlimited reproduction,\" says Martine.

        "question": "Today about 70 countries use Daylight Saving Time (DST). Daylight Saving was first introduced during World War I in Australia. During the world wars, DST was used for the late summers beginning January 1917 and 1942, and the full summers beginning September 1942 and 1943. In 1967, Tasmania experienced a drought . The State Government introduced one hour of daylight saving that summer as a way of saving power and water. Tasmanians liked the idea of daylight saving and the Tasmanian Government has declared daylight saving each summer since 1968. Persuaded by the Tasmanian Government, all states except two passed a law in 1971, for a test use of daylight saving. In 1972, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria joined Tasmania for regular daylight saving, but Queensland did not do so until 1989. Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia have had irregular plans, often changing their dates due to politics or festivals . For example, in 1992, Tasmania extended daylight saving by an extra month while South Australia began extending daylight saving by two weeks for the Adelaide Festival. Special daylight saving plans were made during the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The differences in daylight saving in Australia continue to cause serious problems in transport and many other social activities. It also reduces the number of hours in the working day that are common to all centers in the country. In particular, time differences along the east coast cause major differences, especially for the broadcasters of national radio and television.

Flags were also flown there to warn sailors of bad weather. It's fitting, then, the Italian Gulielmo Marconi should have chosen this site   to receive the world's first radio signal -- in Morse code -- from England on December 12, 1901.      Marconi, combining earlier ideas with his own, led us to a new communications age. For the next 50 years, until the appearance of television, radio ruled the air waves.     Today, it's the TV that rules. No single person can say to have invented television.     In 1884, the German Paul Nipkow invented a device   that sent pictures mechanically  , and in 1906, Boris Rosing, a Russian, used a ray and a disc to create the world's first TV system. Then in the early 1920s, another Russian, Vladimir Zworykin,invented a picture display tube. He took out a patent   for color1 TV, even though it wouldn't be developed for another 25 years.      In 1924, a Scot entered the scene -- John Logie Baird. He first succeeded in sending a moving picture and a year later got the first actual TV picture. In 1926, Baird showed TV in aLondonlaboratory. Two years later inNew York, Felix the Cat became the first TV star. TV excited everyone's imagination, but hardly anyone had a set, with just two thousand in use worldwide in the mid-1930s.  Since the late 1940s, TV technology has developed very quickly. Computers may finally be combined with all televisions to give people a total all-in-one communications network.  Today, it's possible to sit and watch TV in the middle of a forest or in the Arctic. It's surprising when one considers that Marconi was on Signal Hill in the same century.

        "question": "You are enrolled in a full - time school called \"life\". Each day in this school you will have the opportunity to learn lessons. You may like the lessons or hate them, but you have designed them as part of your curriculum. Why are you here? What is your purpose? Humans have sought to discover the meaning of life for a very long time. What we and our ancestors have overlooked, however, is that there is no one answer. The meaning of life is different for every individual.  Each person has his or her own purpose and distinct path, unique and separate from anyone else's. As you travel your life path, you will be presented with numerous lessons that you will need to learn in order to fulfill that purpose. The lessons you are presented with are specific to you; learning these lessons is the key to discovering and fulfilling the meaning and connection of your own life.  As you travel through your lifetime, you may encounter challenging lessons that others don't have to face, while others spend years struggling with challenges that you don't need to deal with. You may never know why you are blessed with a wonderful marriage, while your friends suffer through bitter arguments and painful divorces, just as you cannot be sure why you struggle financially while your peers enjoy abundance. The only thing you can count on for certain is that you will be presented with all the lessons that you specifically need to learn; whether you choose to learn them or not is entirely up to you.  The challenge here, therefore, is to align (......) yourself with your own unique path by learning individual lessons. This is one of the most difficult challenges you will be face with in your lifetime, as sometimes your path will be completely different from others'. But, remember, don't compare your path to the people around you and focus on the difference between their lessons and yours. You need to remember that you will only be faced with lessons that you are capable of learning and are specific to your own growth.      Our sense of fairness is the expectation of equality - the assumption that all things are equal and justice will always prevail. Life is not, in fact, fair, and you may indeed have a more difficult life path than others around you, deserved or not. Everyone's circumstances are unique, and everyone needs to handle his or her own circumstances differently. If you want to move toward calm, you will be required to move out of the complaining phase of \"it's not fair\". Focusing on the unfairness of circumstances keeps you comparing yourself with others rather than appreciating your own special uniqueness. You miss out on learning your individual lessons by distracting yourself with feelings of bitterness and anger. From the passage we can conclude_.",

A new study shows that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking. It compared their risk to whites, Japanese-Americans and Latinos. Researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii did the new study. The New England Journal of Medicine published the findings. The eight-year research studied more than 180,000 people. They included present and former smokers and people who never smoked. Almost 2,000 people in the study developed lung cancer. Researchers say genetics might help explain the racial and ethnic differences. There could be differences in how people's bodies react to smoke. But environmental influences, including the way people smoke, could also make a difference. African-Americans and Latinos in the study are reported smoking the fewest cigarettes per day. Whites are the heaviest smokers. But the scientists point out that blacks have been reported to breathe cigarette smoke more deeply than white smokers. This could fill their lungs with more of the chemicals in tobacco that cause cancer. Scientists know that some diseases effect different groups differently. And some drug companies have begun to develop racially targeted medicines. Last June, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a drug designed to treat heart failure in black patients.

Founded in 1852, it was one of the first and most ambitious US department scores. Mr. Selfridge had done well with Marshall Field's. He liked to say, \"The customer is always right,\" which made the Chicago store popular. And he is believed to have invented the phrase \"Only [so many] Shopping Days until Christmas\". When he visited London on holiday in 1906 he was surprised to find most of the city's department stores were no match of their American and Parisian competitors. This led Selfridge to leave the US and establish Selfridges. a department store named after him. at the west end of London's Oxford Street. In Oxford Street, Selfridge's design team shaped an ambitious classical palacc building with a wall of plate glass windows. Opened in 1909, Selfridges offered customers a hundred departments along with restaurants, a roof garden, reading and writing rooms, reception areas for foreign visitors, a first aid room and. most importantly, a small army of knowledgeable floor-walking assistants who served as guides as well as being thoroughly instructed in the art of making a sale. Mr. Selfridge did much to make the department store a destination rather than just a big and comprehensively stocked city shop. It became a place to meet and for ladies to lunch. Mr. Selfridge later introduced the department store as a key element of the 20th Century culture, and Chaplin acknowledged the growing trend for shopping in the department store in his film The Floorwalker.

        "question": "Children are quick to ask \"why\" and \"how'' when it comes to new things, but research suggests that they learn more when teachers turn the questions back on them. \"When children explain events, they learn more than when just getting the results,'' said Cristine H. Legare, a professor at the University of Texas. Ms. Legare brought in 96 children aged 3 to 5 and set before them a complex toy made up of colorful, interlocking gears  . With the first group, the researchers asked, \"Can you explain this to me?\" With the second one, they said, \"Look, isn't this interesting?'' The two groups of children focused on different things, researchers found. Children who were asked to observe noticed the colors of the toy, while those asked to explain focused on the chain of gears working on each other. Children who had explained the toy were better at re-creating it and not being disturbed by decorative gears, and they were better able to use what they had learned who had observed the toy outperformed the children in the explanation group on a memory task focused on the toy's colors. Dedre Gentner, the director of the cognitive science program at Northwestern University, said that teachers introducing a concept can improve students' understanding  by  giving examples of close comparisons,  and then asking children to explain how concepts are related. In a series of experiments with 3-to 7-year-olds, she focus children can be con be confused by comparisons that focus on a relationship rather than a direct-object match. For example, a 3-year-old shown a picture of two rabbits facing each other and told \"this is a toma '' and then asked to find another \"tome\" will choose a picture of a rabbit over one of two cats facing each other 98 percent of the time. A 7-year-old is more likely to recognize the more abstract comparison of a relationship. However, Ms. Gentner found that 3-year-olds can think more like 7-yesr-olds if they are given more examples. When shown a \"toma\" with rabbits and another with cats, and then asked, \"Can you say why both of these are tomas?\" most of the children can give a good explanation.

        "question": "The Swiss army knife is a popular device that is recognized all over the world. In Switzerland, there is a saying that every good Swiss citizen has one in his or her pocket. But the knife had poor beginnings. In the late nineteenth century, the Swiss army issued  its soldiers a gun that required a special screwdriver  to take it apart and clean it. At the same time, canned food was becoming common in the army. Swiss generals decided to issue each soldier a standard knife to serve both as a screwdriver and a can opener.  _ was a lifesaver for Swiss knife makers, who were struggling to compete with cheaper German imports. In 1884, Carl Elsener, head of the Swiss knife manufacturer(maker) Victorinox, seized that opportunity with both hands, and designed a soldier's knife that the army loved. It was a simple knife with one big blade , a can opener, and a screwdriver. A few years after the soldier's knife was issued, the \"Schweizer Offizier Messer,\" or Swiss Officer's Knife, came on the market. Interestingly, the Officer's Knife was never given to those serving in the army. The Swiss army purchasers considered the new model with a corkscrew  for opening wine not \"essential for survival,\" so officers had to buy this new model by themselves. But its special multi-functional design later launched  the knife as a global brand. After the Second World War, a great number of American soldiers were stationed in Europe. And as they could buy the Swiss army knife at shops on army bases, they bought huge quantities of them. However, it seems that \"Schweizer Offizier Messer\" was too difficult for them to say, so they just called it the Swiss army knife, and that is the name it is now known by all over the world.

In one classie experiment, people were showna vertical line and asked to find a line of identical length from a selection of three. You might think that this is an absurdly easy task, and when people perform it by themselves they do it very well. However, psychologists have discovered that we are very easily swayed by the opinions of other people when we do this task in a group. In one study, a group of three people was set up,where two of the people were confederates of the experimenter.When the confederates deliberately gave wrong answers,people were often swayed to give the wrong answer also. In fact, 75% of people gave at least one wrong answer, with some people conforming to peer pressure on every occasion. But why do people conform in this way?  In an easy task like this,  it seems that people do not want to step out of line with the prevailing opinion of the group. On more difficult tasks, people also conform because they lose onfidence in their own ability to make decisions and prefer to trust the majority opinion instead. A typical example of this kind of conformity arises when we come across people in distress.

        "question": "People who daydream are often thought of in negative terms, such as being lazy or not doing what they should be doing. However, scientists who study the brain have learned many interesting things from studying the brains of daydreamers. Far from being a waste of time, recent research has shown that daydreaming is a healthy and useful activity for all of our brains. To study the brain, scientists use special devices that scan the brain and show pictures of which parts of the brain are active at certain times. When a person is daydreaming, the device will show a distinct pattern of activity in the brain called the \"default\" mode of thinking. In the default mode, the top or outside part of the brain is very active. Actually, several regions of the brain are interacting in this mode. Some scientists describe this mode as a time when the brain focuses on itself rather than focusing on the environment around the person. Typically, this occurs when a person is doing simple, undemanding work or performing routine actions that don't need much attention, like walking to school or cooking simple foods. People tend to daydream during such activities. The importance of daydreaming lies in developing both creative and social skills. When the mind is not engaged in dealing with one's immediate situation or problem, then it is free to wander. A time of wandering allows the mind to create things. New inventions may be imagined, or possible solutions to a problem can be planned. For example, solutions to problems in relationships with other people may spring to mind. In fact, most daydreams involve situations with others. Perhaps these are daydreams based on past memories, or daydreams of what might be in the future. In either case, daydreams help us develop the appropriate skills we can use in real interactions with others. As brain specialist Dr. Marcus Raichle of Washington University explains: \"When you don't use a muscle, that muscle really isn't doing much. But when your brain is supposedly doing nothing and daydreaming, it's really doing a great amount.\" During the so-called \"resting state\" the brain isn't resting at all!

Other studies have linked certain content of television programs, such as violence and sex, to children's behavior.But beyond this issue, Gordon-Larsen said that kids who spend hours watching TV \"miss opportunities\" to develop skills, learn teamwork and have other experiences that their more active peers benefit from. That doesn't mean, however, that kids have to be on the football team. The study found that some activities like skating and skateboarding----which adults sometimes frown upon----were also related to better self respect and less risk taking. That skaters were better behaved than TV watchers might come as a surprise to some adults who consider these teens to be bad, according to Gordon-Larsen.Skateboarding is forbidden in many public areas, and some communities oppose building skating parks.But if kids who like to skate have nowhere to do it, \"it's a shame,\" said Gordon-Larsen.

Sometimes the weaknesses seem to outweigh the strengths and sometimes it's the other way around. Some people get sick easily. Some struggle to manage their finances properly. Some people are hopeless communicators and struggle with relationships. Many people leave it and accept it as just bad luck but not everyone. Some people are facing huge limit. Bret! Eastburn has no arms or legs and yet is an inspirational speaker and find still manage to achieve tremendous things. They rise above their weaknesses and do not allow limit their possibilities. I attended a school prize-giving ceremony not so long ago and the guest speaker was Andrew Becroft, who had a severe stutter as a child. Instead of allowing this to limit him, he chose to work hard to overcome it. He is now the Principal Youth Court Judge for New Zealand. Not only did he become successful, but he did so in a profession where he had to speak in front of others regularly where his weakness is front and center for all to see. If he hadn't worked on his speaking ability, it would have been very limiting to his life and career prospects. You can find similar people on New Zealand News channels, and I suspect the same in other countries. There are a number of presenters and reporters who have a noticeably unusual manner of speaking. Perhaps they have a peculiar accent or pitch of voice. These people have succeeded in spite of what would appear to be a weakness in their profession. Lots of people face far more significant limitations than you do. They may be missing limbs or are born into extreme poverty. But no matter what the limitation, you will always find people who have overcome it. Why does the writer speak of Brett Eastburn?",

Here are some examples of how to best use the power of the mind: During the 2004 Olympics,one of the swimmers told of how she would fall asleep each night with the picture of a clock in her mind. It was the timer's clock she would see at the end of her Olympic swim and it always had her world-record-breaking time on it. In his pre-shot routine, Tiger Woods never varies the number of practice swings or intensity of his concentration.The pre-shot routine is always the same so that the stroke will always be the same. Michael Phelps,American Swimming Gold Medalist, always stretches out his back and arms by swinging both arms three times before his event. Not 2,not 4: always 3. He is anchoring in his winning state of mind and state of body as well as stretching. In athletics, an anchor is a gesture or series of gestures that put you into the frame-of mind(and body)you want to be in to win.Repetition is what makes it work .That means practice,practice,practice ---- with your body as well as your mind.

The plane took off from an airport in Switzerland at 45km an hour. It slowly rose above the fields and into the sky. \"There has never been an airplane of that kind that could fly -- never an airplane so big, so light, using so little energy,\" said Bertrand Piccard, a leader of the project. During the 90-minute flight, the plane did several turns. It climbed nearly 1.6km above the countryside. Engineers plan to test a night flight before July. Then they will use the results of the tests to build a second plane. They plan to travel around the world in that plane in 2012. The plane flies at 70 km an hour. That is faster than a bike and slower than a car. Piccard and pilot Andre Borschberg will take the plane around the world.

Friends and mates allow us to enjoy our success and our joys, comfort us in our challenging moments, and provide a mirror for us to learn more about ourselves. I've always looked at friends as the family we choose. They enrich our lives. As Robert Louis Steven once said, \"A friend is a present which you give yourself.\"    To be a good friend or partner, it's importable be a good listener. Hear what your friend or mate has to say first rather than jumping to conclusions or getting defensive. Sometimes it is useful to be their mirror, for when they hear their words repeated back to them, it can help them to realize that what they said was not exactly what they meant to say.    Patience, compassion and empathy are also important traits in being a good friend or partner. You know the old golden rule, \"Care for others the way you would like them to care for you.\" The support of a friend during a tough time could make the difference between success and failure. Encouragement and confidence are priceless gifts that can help change a person's life.    Take care, though, with whom you choose to have close relationship, for they can have a tremendous impact on your self-esteem and life path.

Led by scientists at the Zoological Society of London, the Edge Coral Reefs project has identified 10 coral species in most urgent risk of becoming extinct.The scientists say that reefs are under pressure from a variety of threats including rising sea temperatures due to climatic instability, increased acidity , overfishing and pollution. The Edge plan, which focuses on the most evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species , will take a regional approach to conservation.This means focusing on the \"coral triangle\" around the Philippines, the West Indian Ocean around the Mozambique channel, and in the Caribbean channel. \"Coral reefs are threatened with functional extinction in the next 20-50 years, due predominantly to global climatic instability,\" said Catherine Head, coordinator of the reefs project.\"In these regions, we'll be supporting and training in-country conservationists to carry out research and implement targeted conservation actions,\" she said.\"Their projects will last initially for two years.We provide them with a whole host of tools to carry out their projects including funding and intensive training.\" She added. Coral reefs are the planet's most diverse marine ecosystem , known as the rainforests of the oceans.Despite taking up under 0.2% of the ocean floor, they provide food and shelter for almost a third of all sea life.If we lose the ecosystems, we lose not only the biodiversity  , but we also lose the capability of people to obtain income and food from coral reefs. Climatic instability, which leads to rising sea temperatures, causes corals to bleach.Bleaching occurs when sea temperatures rise and this causes the coral tissue to expel their symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae - these are what give the coral their colour.Bleached corals often die if the stress continues.Among the 10 species chosen to start the Edge project are the pearl bubble coral, a food source for the hawksbill turtle, and the Mushroom coral, which supports at least 15 brightly colored fish.

He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed  and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day. However, the unconscious part expresses itself through its own logic and its own language.. It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first. This is why dreams are sometimes called \"secret messages to ourselves\". Thomas Edison is mentioned because  _  .",

When Daniel's father remarried after a divorce, Daniel, who was eleven, and his little sister, Kristie, came to live with us. My husband and I were more than happy to have kids in the house again. Things were going along just fine until the diabetes   I've lived with most of my adult life started affecting my eyes, and then more seriously, my kidneys  . Then everything seemed to fall apart. Three times a week, I had to go to the hospital to be hooked up to a dialysis machine  . I was living, but I couldn't really call it a life -- it was an existence. I had no energy. I dragged myself through daily chores and slept as much as I could. My sense of humor seemed to disappear. Daniel, seventeen by then, was really affected by the change in me. He tried as hard as he could to make me laugh, to bring back the grandma who loved to clown around   with him. Even in my sorry state, Daniel could still bring a smile to my face. But things were not improving. After a year on dialysis, my condition was deteriorating   and the doctors felt that if I didn't receive a kidney transplant within six months, I would surely die. No one told Daniel this, but he knew -- he said all he had to do was look after me. To top it off, as my condition worsened, there was a chance that I would become too weak to have the transplant surgery at all, and then there would be nothing they could do for me. So we started the tense and desperate wait for a kidney. I was adamant   that I didn't want a kidney from anyone I knew. I would wait until an appropriate kidney became available, or I would literally die waiting. But Daniel had other plans. The time that he took me to my dialysis appointments, he did a little secret research on his own. Then he announced his intention to me. \"Grandma, I'm giving you one of my kidneys. I'm young and I'm healthy ...\" He paused. He could see I wasn't at all happy with his offer. He continued, almost in whisper, \"And most of all, I couldn't stand it if you weren't around.\" His face wore an expression of appeal mixed with determination. He can be as stubborn as a mule   once he decides on something -- but I've been told many times that I can out-stubborn any mule! We argued. I couldn't let him do it. We both knew that if he gave up his kidney, he would also give up his life's dream; to play football. It was all he ever talked about. And he was good, too. Daniel was co-captain and star defensive tackle   of his high school team; he expected to apply for a football scholarship and was looking forward to playing college football. He just loved the sport. \"How can I let you throw away the thing that means the most to you?\" I pleaded with him. \"Grandma,\" he said softly, \"compared to your life, football means nothing to me.\" After that, I couldn't argue anymore. So we agreed to see if he was a good donor   match, and then we'd discuss it further. When the tests came back, they showed Daniel was a perfect match. That was it. I knew I wasn't going to win that argument, so we scheduled the transplant. Both surgeries went smoothly. As soon as I came out of the anesthesia   , I could tell things were different. I felt great! The nurses in the intensive care unit had to keep telling me to lie back and be quiet -- I wasn't supposed to be that lively! I was afraid to go to sleep, for fear I would break the spell   and wake up the way I had been before. But the good feeling didn't go away, and I spent the evening joking and laughing with anyone who would listen. It was so wonderful to feel alive again. The next day they moved me out of ICU and onto the floor where Daniel was recuperating   three doors away. His grandfather helped him walk down to see me as soon as I was moved into my room. When we saw each other, we did not know what to say. Holding hands, we just sat there and looked at each other for a long time, overwhelmed by the deep feeling of love that connected us. Finally, he spoke, \"Was it worthwhile, grandma?\" I laughed a little ruefully  . \"It was for me! But was it for you?\" I asked him. He nodded and smiled at me. \"I've got my grandma back.\" And I have my life back. It still amazes me. Every morning, when I wake up, I thank God --and Daniel -- for this miracle. A miracle born of the purest love. How did grandma feel when Daniel announced his intention to give her one of his kidneys?",

        "question": "Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our own Milky Way and in other galaxies. This is a major achievement because,in   terms,planets are very small and do not give out light. Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove  _ more difficult. The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. In our own solar system,for example,Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. Only the Earth provides ideal conditions,and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve .     Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its \"sun\". Imagine a star up to twenty times larger, brighter and hotter than our own sun. A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. On the contrary, if the star were small,the life--supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. But how would we fund such a planet? At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life.  _ .      It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth--based telescopes. Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. Even a telescope in orbit round the earth like the very successful Hubble telescope,would not be suitable because of the dust particles in our solar system. A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. Once we detected a planet,we would have to find a way of blocking out the light from its star, so that we would be able to \"see\" the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life,rather than \"little green men\" . The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. As Earth-dwellers,we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. But this hope only exists in science fiction. If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet,it would completely change our view of ourselves. As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed,\"Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human efforts or thought would be unchanged by it.\" What do we know about the kind of planet,other than our own,that might be able to support life?",

Today's advertisements, or ads, try to get consumers to buy certain brands. Writers of advertising are so skillful that they can, sometimes persuade a consumer to wear a certain kind of clothing, eat a special kind of cereal, or see a movie. Consumers might never even want a product if they did not see or hear advertisements for it. For example, you probab1y do not need the newest cereal in the supermarket. There are probably many cereal brands on your kitchen shelves. You may not have space on a shelf for another. But if you see ads about a new cereal that is your extra-tasty and has a free prize in the box, you may want it. Advertising must get attention. To be effective, it must be exciting, entertaining, or provide some pleasure. The secret of writing good advertising copy is to offer a good idea as well as a product.

        "question": "Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today.  The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate  minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite  that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \"home.\" How did the scientists reach the finding?",

She poured her heart into her report and expressed her dream of becoming an airline pilot. Her paper came back with an \"F\" on it. The teacher told her it was a \"fairy tale\". Jean was heartbroken and ashamed. As the years went by, Jean was beaten down by the discouragement and negativity she encountered whenever she talked about her dream. \"Girls can't become airline pilots; never have, never will. You're crazy. That's impossible. \"Finally Jean gave up. In her senior year of high school, her English teacher was a Mrs. Dorothy Slaton, a demanding teacher with high standards. One day Mrs. Slaton asked this question: \"If you had unlimited finances, unlimited access to the finest schools, unlimited talents and abilities, what would you do?\" Jean felt a rush of the old enthusiasm, and with excitement she wrote down the very old dream. The next thing that Mrs. Slaton said changed the course of Jean's life. The teacher leaned forward over her desk and said, \"I have a little secret for you. You do have unlimited abilities and talents. When you leave school, if you don't go for your dreams, no one will do it for you. You can have what you want if you want it enough.\" The hurt and fear of years of discouragement disappeared all of a sudden. Jean felt thrilled and told her about her dream of becoming a pilot. Mrs. Slaton slapped the desk top. \"Then do it!\" she said. So Jean did. It didn't happen overnight. In her l0 years of hard work, even facing varieties of laugh, frustration and opposition, she never gave up her dream.

        "question": "Billie Holiday was an American jazz singer and songwriter. Nicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner, Lester Young, Holiday was a great influence on jazz and pop singing. Her voiced style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of controlling tempo  . Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and direct approach to singing. Billie Holiday was born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father, Clarence Halliday (Holiday), a musician, did not marry or live with her mother. Her mother had moved to Philadelphia when thirteen, after being driven away from her parents' home in Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore for becoming pregnant. With no support from her own parents, Holiday's mother arranged for the young Holiday to stay with her older married half sister, Eva Miller, who lived in Baltimore. During her final period of separation from her mother, Holiday began to perform the songs she learned while working in the brothel  . By early 1929, Holiday joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. In order to live, Holiday and her mother had to work there. Holiday had not yet turned fourteen at that time. On May 2, 1929, the house was raided  , and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending some time in a workhouse, her mother was released in July, followed by Holiday in October, at the age of 14. She co-wrote a few songs, and several of them have become jazz standards, notably God Bless the Child, Don't Explain, and Lady Sings the Blues. She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by others, including Easy Living and Strange Fruit. Her early career is hard to track down exactly. But, she later gained work singing in local jazz clubs before being spotted by a talent scout  , John Hammond, in 1933, aged 18. Her voice and recordings are loved for the depth of emotion and intensity she could bring to classic standards. Her range of voice was not the greatest, but, her extraordinary gravelly   voice was soon to become very famous and influential. She was an important icon of the jazz era and influential in the development of jazz singing. In the late 1930s she began singing a civil rights song called Strange Fruit--a song which told the tale of a lynching   of a black man in the deep south. It was very controversial for that period and it was not played on radios. It was recorded for Commodore records and she performed it many times over the next 20 years. In early 1959 she found out that she had cirrhosis   of the liver. The doctor told her to stop drinking, which she did for a short time, but soon returned to heavy drinking. By May she had lost twenty pounds, friends Leonard Feather, Joe Glaser, and Allan Morrison tried to get her to check into to a hospital, she put them off.  On May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York suffering from liver and heart disease. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying, and her hospital room was raided by authorities. Police officers were stationed at the door to her room. Holiday remained under police guard at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959.Billie Holiday had difficult life experiences which influenced her attitude towards life. She experienced many violent relationships. She also became increasingly dependent on various drugs which contributed to her early death in 1959, aged just 44.

You jump out of bed, rush into the shower, into your clothes and out the door with hardly a moment to think. A stressful journey to work gets your blood pressure climbing. Once at the office, you glance through the newspaper with depressing stories or reports of disasters. In that sort of mood, who can get down to work, particularly some creative, original problem-solving work? The way most of us spend our mornings is exactly opposite to the conditions that promote flexible, open-minded thinking. Imaginative ideas are most likely to come to us when we're unfocused. If you are one of those energetic morning people, your most inventive time comes in the early evening when you are relaxed. Sleepy people's lack of focus leads to an increase in creative problem solving. By not giving yourself time to tune into your wandering mind, you're missing out on the surprising solutions it may offer. The trip you take to work doesn't help, either. The stress slows down the speed with which signals travel between neurons  , making inspirations less likely to occur.

        "question": "Farmers, especially in developing countries, are often criticized for cutting down forests. But a new study suggests that many farmers recognize the value of keeping trees. Researchers using satellite images found at least ten percent tree cover on more than one billion hectares of farmland. That is almost half the farmland in the world. Earlier estimates were much lower but incomplete. The authors of the new study say it may still underestimate the true extent worldwide. The study found the most tree cover in South America. Next comes Africa south of the Sahara, followed by Southeast Asia. North Africa and West Asia have the least. The study found that climate conditions alone could not explain the amount of tree cover in different areas. Nor could the size of nearby populations, meaning people and trees can live together. There are areas with few trees but also few people, and areas with many trees and many people. The findings suggest that things like land rights, markets or government policies can influence tree planting and protection. Dennis Garrity, who heads the World Agroforestry Center, says farmers are acting on their own to protect and plant trees. The problem, he says, is that policy makers and planners have been slow to recognize this and to support such efforts. The satellite images may not show what the farmers are using the trees for, but trees provide nuts, fruit, wood and other products. They also help prevent soil loss and protect water supplies. Even under drought conditions, trees can often provide food and a way to earn money until the next growing season. Some trees act as natural fertilizers. They take nitrogen out of the air and put it in the soil. Scientists at the Center say the use of fertilizer trees can re-duce the need for chemical nitrogen by up to three-fourths.

Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much. Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession.  And Deborah began to see a new light in her life. Currently as a senior in college, Deborah focuses on getting a degree in physical treatment. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well. How did Deborah feel when she first hurt her knee?",

        "question": "Henderson Island is a coral island raised above the South Pacific Ocean, No people live on it. The island is 9. 6 km long and 5. 1 km wide. It has an area of 37, 3 square kilometers. It became a World Heritage Site in 1988 because of its bird life.     All the four kinds of special land birds can only be seen on Henderson Island. There are also fifteen non-local seabirds. Other local things include nine kinds of plants, four kinds of land snails, and one butterfly. Although no people live on the island, archaeological   evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life.     On January 29* 1606, Henderson Island was discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fermandes, who named it San Joao Baptista. On January 17, 1819, the island was rediscovered by British Captain Henderson, who named it Henderson Island. On March 2* 1819* Captain Henry King, sailing on the Elizabeth, landed on the island to find the Union flag already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship on a tree, and for some years the name of the island was Elizabeth or Henderson. In the early 1980's, American businessman Arthur expressed interest in buying Henderson Island, and establishing a small settlement with an airport, farm and large houses. But the British government refused it at last* after environmentalist groups persuaded them to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island which became a World Heritage Site later.

        "question": "More than 30 million kids buy school lunch each day. This year, many schools raised lunch prices to fight raising costs. Students pay about $2 a meal now. That is 27 cents more than last year. But they still get a good deal. The average cost for schools to produce one meal has gone up 30 cents, and is now $3. So, how do schools neither make money nor lose money? To start, the government pays for a small part of the difference. Schools have to make up the rest. Peggy Eller, a leader of school nutrition   service in Hudson, Wisconsin, said her district is cutting costs by using fewer paper products and serving smaller portion . Well, portion control is one key to healthful eating! The push for more healthful food has grown in recent years. One in five kids aged 6 to 19 is overweight. Being overweight can cause health problems. Many states passed laws that require schools to serve nutritious meals. Since 2004, more than 90% of all U.S. Schools have removed the fat from lunches. Foods high in fat, salt and sugar have been replaced by low-fat milk, fresh fruits and vegetables. These new items on lunch menus have encouraged kids to change their eating habits. \"It makes easier to try new things at home, \"said Savanna Mackey, a Florida fifth-grader. Students need healthful meals to grow strong and do well in school. \"Rising prices won't stand in the way,\"says school nutritionist Jane Thornton. \"We'll just be more clever in how we do things.\" What can be inferred from the passage?",

Singapore's method is highly visual and explores fewer topics, but in greater depth.While Singapore's text books have an average of 34 lessons with 15 pages of explanation for each, much bulkier texts in the US include an average of 157 lessons, with about four pages of explanation per lesson.There arc some more surprising differences. Professional development is intensive for all teachers in Singapore, but strangely about half of the elementary teachers do not have university degrees.That is certain to change, though, as education standards for entering teachers are increasing, said Madame Low, the director of curriculum, planning and development with Singapore's Ministry of Education.\" Starting salaries for math teachers match public sector accountants or engineers.Teachers are treated as professionals,\" added Madame Low. Mentoring programs for new teachers in Singapore last five years! Teacher evaluations there are extremely comprehensive, and teachers who succeed receive bonuses worth one to three months of salary.Grades one and two have smaller class sizes--only 30 students.Students are taught in English, not their native tongue.Many are bilingual or trilingual. People often ask, how applicable is a successful model in Singapore to the more diverse and much larger US? I'm also interested in the practical challenges.Given that books in the US are written with state standards and assessments in mind, matching them up with another country's approach might be tough.

He also enjoys literature and art. Before he took the film acting as his career,he had worked in an airline in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan Province. His change of job to acting was quite by chance. One day,he came across in the paper an advertisement for a leading actor to appear in the film named \"Wedding Feast.\" Full of excitement,he answered the job ad by telephoning the director of the film -- Mr. Li An. It was this telephone call that had changed all his life. At last the director decided him to be the very person for the role. That he could be chosen owed much to his good command of English,natural manners and low pay for his work in the film. The film \"Wedding Feast\" proved to be a hit. It won the German Golden Bear Award and entered the competition for one of the Oscar Academy Awards. Also, it was the first Taiwan film that was permitted to be shown in the U. S. Thanks to the film,Zhao Wenxuan became popular in Taiwan, Hong Kong and southeast Asia. In 1994,Mr. Zhao acted as a leading role in the Hong Kong film,\"Red Rose and White Rose\",in which many film stars like Ms Chen Chong from U. S. and Ms Ye Yuqing from the local area participated. This film was named for 10 prizes of the Taiwan Golden Horse Prize and at last it was awarded five prizes for the best play,actress and music. Zhao has regarded the film as one of his favorite films since he stepped into the acting circle. Since 1993,Mr. Zhao has taken part in the shootings of 13 films, most of which are thought highly of. Mr. Zhao said the that Taiwan should think to cooperate much with the mainland in the film producing industry and it would benefit each other.

A CV   is the only way to get a job. To tell the truth, many employers don't like or actually read CVs.Some employers would prefer to judge a person after a face-to-face meeting, or give them some part-time work first to see what they are truly like in the workplace. Having an up-to-date CV is important when applying for jobs advertised in the paper, from larger organizations, or when you want to leave some information about yourself for the employers. I have to make my decision now and stick to it. There is a great saying: \"Life is a journey not a destination.\" Journeys are full of options.You make and change your decisions all the time based on new experiences and information. Yes, you do have to make decisions, but you do not have to be limited by those career decisions by sticking to them.What's more important is having a go and exploring new things. I can't get into the work I like because there are too few opportunities. I have no doubt getting into work that you really want to do can be challenging.But I do also believe opportunities exist in most career areas because employment needs change all the time.One strategy I'd suggest if you can't get your dream job is to go after what you want and grab any opportunity that moves you toward your dream job. It's the school's responsibility to talk about careers and work. Schools do have a part to play in providing career advice for students, but others also have a responsibility.I would suggest that a student-parent-school partnership approach is a far better way of looking at this.A lot of information is available on the internet, in the newspapers, through relatives and friends.

Mr. John Evans had never found the time or money to make the trip from his home in Forest Fach, near Swansea. But, when British Rail offered him an all-expenses-paid birthday trip to the capital he just could not refuse. He arrived at Paddington Station and smartly turned out in his best suit, favorite Panama hat and a red rose in his buttonhole. \"It's very exciting. There's no doubt about it,\" he said. Until yesterday he had never been far from home, except for one trip to Aberdeen. \"But I've been on the seas to that faraway land called Ilfracombe 21 miles from home,\" he joked. Mr Evans, who spent 60 years working as a miner in South Wales, almost made the journey to London once before, at the turn of the century. \"There was a trip to the White City but it was ten shillings return from Swansea -- too much I thought. All my money went to the family then,\" he said. During the next two days Mr. Evans will be taken on a short tour of London to see the sights.

        "question": "Once upon a time, science fiction was just a style among other styles. There were crime stories, there were horror stories, there was literary fiction-and there was science fiction. But today science themes dominate these other styles. It's difficult to think of much modern crime, horror or \"serious\" fiction that doesn't involve science. And it's not just books. With every second movie and computer game having a sci-fi element, science fiction seems to have controlled our entire entertainment culture. It's clear that if we want to define science fiction we should relate it to the role that science plays in our lives. Perhaps the place to start is by noting when it began. Although some experts have claimed to be able to trace sci-fi back to ancient times, it is more plausible to find it in initial form in the 19th century, when industrial societies arose. One of the features that set industrial societies apart from other kinds was the increasing part that science played in everyday life. Factories with vast machines turned out huge quantities of goods, which were transported by trains, motor vehicles and ships all over the world. Cities were built on the back of technology, with electricity in homes and hospitals helping everyone to lead healthier, more convenient lives. All of these changes had great effects not only on people's real lives, but on their imaginative ones. Writers began to articulate these changing physical and mental landscapes, eventually giving science fiction a large and devoted fan base of especially young readers, who found that it spoke to their curiosity about the future that science would create. But sci-fi reflected fears about science more than it did hopes. These typical early science fiction novel might be a UK novel like H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (1897). With great skill, Wells played upon the fears of technology by imagining Earth under threat by a civilization -that of men from Mars. The science fiction of today expresses the impact of the computing revolution, robotics and our environmental challenges, while it is less concerned with \"little green men from Mars\" and other themes of past sci-fi. Given that science, technology and politics are always intertwined  , contemporary science fiction often has a great deal to say about power. Many recent novels - like American Cory Doctorow's Little Brother (2008) - are concerned with government and security service \"conspiracies  \" against the people, particularly as the revelations of whistleblowers like Edward Snowden sink in. This can give sci-fi writing a \"skeptical\" feel. This underlines one of the features that remains constant between the beginnings of the empire of science fiction and its state today. As then, so now: We want to read about how fearful the future will be, not how it will be a paradise  . What caused science fiction to appear in the 19th century?",

The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile. He lived in a flat above the shop, alone. Except in the very bad weather, you always knew where to find him in the afternoon, as I have said. Once, on a sunny afternoon, I walked home along the river bank from a shopping trip to the village. By my watch it was three minutes past four, so I was astonished to see Bill sitting there on his little chair with a line in the water. He had had no luck, I could see, but he was making no effort to move. \"What's wrong, Bill?\" I called out from the path. For answer, he put a hand in his jacket and took out a big, golden object. For a moment I had no idea what it could be, and then it suddenly went off with a noise like a fire engine. Stopping the bell, Bill held the thing up and called back, \"Ten to four, you see, and this is dead right.\" I had never known anyone carrying a brass alarm clock round with him before. On that sunny afternoon, the writer was surprised when he saw Bill because   _  .",

        "question": "A woman named Emily renewing her driver's license at the County Clerk's office was asked to state her occupation. She hesitated, uncertain how to classify herself. \"What I mean is,\" explained the recorder, \"do you have a job, or are you just a ...\" \"Of course I have a job,\" said Emily. \"I'm a mother.\" \"We don't list 'mother' as an occupation... 'housewife' covers it,\" said the recorder. One day I found myself in the same situation. The clerk was obviously a career woman, confident and possessed of a high sounding title. \"What is your occupation?\" she asked. The words simply popped out. \"I'm a Research Associate in the field of Child Development and Human Relations.\" The clerk paused, ballpoint pen frozen in midair. I repeated the title slowly, then I stared with wonder as my statement was written in bold, black ink on the official questionnaire. \"Might I ask,\" said the clerk with new interest, \"Just what you do in this field?\" Coolly, without any trace of panic in my voice, I heard myself reply, \"I have a continuing program of research (what mother doesn't), in the lab and in the field (normally I would have said indoors and out). Of course, the job is one of the most demanding in the humanities (any mother care to disagree?), and I often work 14 hours a day (24 is more like it). But the job is more challenging than most careers and rewards are more of a satisfaction rather than just money.\" There was an increasing note of respect in the clerk's voice as she completed the form, stood up, and showed me out. As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up   by my glamorous new career, I was greeted by my lab assistants---ages 13, 7, and 3. Upstairs I could hear our new experimental model (a 6 month old baby), in the child-development program, testing out a new vocal pattern. I felt proud! I had gone on the official records as someone more distinguished and indispensable   to mankind than \"just another mother.\" Motherhood...What a glorious career! Especially when there's a title on the door. How did the female clerk feel at first when the author told her occupation?",

As a boy ,I always thought people simply bought whatever they need. Whether Grandfather knew this, I don't know. One day he said, \"Come, I have something for you.\" I followed him to a workroom. \"You should have a toy boat. You can sail it at Storvassdal.\" He said. Great, I thought,looking around for the boat. But there was none. Grandfather pointed to a block of wood. \"The boat is in there,\" he said. Then he handed me some tools and showed me how to use them properly. \"It'll be a fine boat,and you'll make it with your own hands,\" he said,\"No one can give you what you do for yourself.\" The words rang in my head as I worked. Finished the boat. It wasn't much to look at ,but I was poud. Then I sailed it at Storvassdal. We had to return to America. \"You cannot bring that boat home with you,\" my mother said. We already had too much baggage. Feeling sad, I hid my boat under a big rock at Storvassdal. I said good-bye to Grandfather, not knowing I would never see him again. In 1964, I went to Storvassdal with my parents and my wife and children. To my surprise,for 34 years my treasure stayed here,waiting for my return. I felt _ were togethet again although my grandfather had died 22 years before. I carved\"1930\"and\"1964\" on its side and put it back. I returned to the lake in 1968,1971,1977 and 1988. Each time I had the boat and carved the year,my grandfather seemed near. My last trip to Storvassdal was in 1991. I brought my granddaughters: Catherine,13; Claire,12.

That is in Nevada?\" Taxi drivers were uniform sympathetic when I said I'd just been fired.\"This is America,\"a Haitian driver said.\"One door is closed.Another is open.\"He argued against my plan to burn down my boss' s house.A Pakistani driver even turned down a chance to profit from my loss of hope;he refused to take me to the middle of the George Washington Bridge--a $20 trip.\"Why do you want to go there?

It's known later that several officers were also aboard, observing the training exercises. The Kursk is lying on the ocean floor in the Barents Sea. The Russian Navy said that it was listing 30 degrees to port. Other sources reported it was listing as much 60 as degrees. According to a Russian newspaper, when the submarine Kursk failed to make contact with the naval command at the right time later that day, Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Vyachesav Popov ordered rescue ships into the area. It took hours to find the submarine, as it didn't launch  a marking buoy  before sinking. Russian Navy Chief insisted that the submarine Kursk had been involved  in a major collision , but a great deal of information shows that this is not true. Up till now, it's believed that an explosion in the torpedo compartment  in the nose of the Kursk was the likely cause. Now Russian government officially asked Norway for help in recovering of sailors' bodies first of all, and Norway has agreed to offer all help. But Russian insisted that only Russians work inside the submarine Kursk and that the work last for about 10~18 working days. It is expected to recover only 25~35 bodies from the Kursk. It was not until October 25, when a team of Russian divers entered the submarine Kursk, some 350 feet below the surface, that truth became clear. On November 7, in the morning, owing to   the icy and the cold weather, a special rescue meeting held on Murmansk decided to stop the whole bodies recovering operation.

But strangely, he still missed the necklace! He came out and started walking away, feeling sad. Just then, an old man walking by saw him, and asked him what was the matter.

He again asked the clerk to tell him the problem and promised that he would not tell anyone about it. The clerk told him about the necklace and how he tried and tried to catch it, but kept failing.

Today, they want risk and excitement -- the closer to the edge, the better. They snowboard over cliff and hike deep mountains. Extreme sports started as an alternative to more expensive sports such as golf. A city kid who couldn't afford expensive sports equipment could get a skateboard and have fun. But now it has become a whole new area of sports, with specialized equipment and high levels of skill. There is even an Olympics for extreme sports, called the winter x-game, which includes snow mountain hiking and ice climbing. What makes extreme sports so popular? Maybe it's because people love the risk. City people want to be outdoors on the weekends and do something challenging. The new equipment is so much better that people can take more risks without getting hurt. Sure there's a risk. Once you go mountain hiking or snowboarding, it's impossible to go back to have riding or skiing. It's just too boring. Now even the older crowd is starting to join in. Every weekend, groups of friends in their early 30s get together. On weekdays they work as computer programmers in the same office. On weekends they hike mountains together.

Young readers learn about 20 words at each level, then move to the next level as they read a different fairy tale. \"For example, I've taken the story of Goldilocks , and I bring back all the words the kids have learned in Cinderella, and I add 20 more until the ninth level. By the end of the entire series, it will be 100 percent in the target language.\" Burke says students often think of language learning as dull, but it doesn't have to be. He designed his books with color1ful cartoon-like illustrations  that attract the young readers. He says many people in other parts of the world often speak at least two languages. Americans have a different reputation. \"It's a joke in the linguistic  world that's painful, and funny. It's, What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual.  And what do you call a person who speaks two languages? Bilingual. And what do you call a person who speaks one language? American.\" Not all Americans are monolingual, of course, but too many Americans are fluent only in English, and he is working to change that. Burke's series of books are intended for   _  knowing little foreign language.",

        "question": "Everyone knows how the story of Cinderella ends, but did you ever really think about how she spent her days before she met the prince? Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, \"Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?\" she probably would have answered, \"Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!\" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams   ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled   and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do.

This appears not only in the workplace where we can make more money or enjoy our job more, but also shows itself in marriage, raising a family and the ability to reach goals in almost every area of life. Interpersonal skills come into play when our flight is cancelled and we need to make other arrangements. _ come into play when a marriage is threatened by financial challenges or infidelity . Our communication skills even matter when we are in traffic and we need to make a decision about how to respond to other drivers. Communicating with others becomes inseparable from having a good day, or a bad day not only in how we begin communication, but in how we react to the communications of others who are having a difficult time. It can make a difference in saving a marriage or getting a divorce, celebrating a rise or getting fired, and even having your eggs cooked as the way you like at the local restaurant. Many wise men and women have stressed the importance of dealing with others in a skillful manner. Getting feedback  from others can be of great value in improving our interpersonal communication skills. Often, however, others are not skilled at giving feedback. When we get negative results, they rarely include the details we need in order to improve our interpersonal skills. Since life improves so much with greater communication skills, getting feedback and an opportunity to improve would be not only life-saving for pilots, but labor-saving for the rest of us.

Earth Day activities can include learning something about technology like cars that are more environmentally friendly and special houses that save energy and water.An organization called the Earth Day Network encourages people to use clean energy which doesn't pollute the environment.Most of our energy comes from fossil fuels   that are found underground. Coal, oil and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels.Fossil fuels come from plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning fossil fuels to create energy pollutes the air and water. Many scientists think that burning fossil fuels also increases the temperature of the earth. To reduce the use of fossil fuels. scientists are experimenting with hydrogen-powered   cars. These cars don't pollute the air like gas-powered cars. Some scientists guess that by 2025, fossil fuels will run out.When people can no longer use gasoline, they may use fuel cells instead. Fuel cells use hydrogen to create energy. People do not need to worry about hydrogen running out, because it is renewable and replaceable. In Washington, D.C., a few people drive cars that run on fuel cells.

Zurich   From swimming in Lake Zurich in summer to skiing the Alps in winter, Zurich attracts visitors year-round. As a fairytale city, Zurich is set on the banks of both a river and a lake, with the snow-topped Swiss Alps rising in the background. Clean cobblestone streets hug a hilly land and medieval   church tops reach heavenward. Despite its reputation for being the center of old-school international banking and a capital for chocolate, Zurich is also a very modern city that chooses to enjoy life at an unhurried pace. Travelers desiring a real experience should strive to do the same. The City of Angels  The City of Angels, the Entertainment Capital of the World--Los Angeles needs no introduction. But its notoriety   both helps and hurts its reputation. The traffic on the \"101\" will tire you out just as much as an evening at a lively West Hollywood club. And your dislike at the thick smog over the city will ruin your enjoyment of a sunset overlooking Santa Monica Beach. To appreciate Los Angeles, visit the area more than once and get advice from locals. Prague   A prosperous and busy city, Prague now attracts more tourists than ever. But its picturesque downtown veils   both a dark legacy and a resilient   past; in its 1,100 years, Prague has survived numerous overthrows, invasions, fires and floods. It's this reputation for survival and perseverance that has made the Czech capital so fascinating. Today, its storied churches, narrow streets, hilltop castle and statue-lined bridges create the scene of an urban fairy tale. Even the most tired traveler would have trouble resisting this city's charms. Puerto Rico   Pick a vacation experience you're looking for, and Puerto Rico can help. Puerto Rico is an old town with a lot of historic architecture and cobblestone streets. Look no further than Old San Juan and its El Morro fortress.Consider the bioluminescent   bays of Culebra and Vieques. Puerto Rico is a global destination with high-end shopping and exciting nightlife. Yellowstone   More than 3,000 square miles of nature's finest canyons, hot springs and rocky cliffs are an easy sell for outdoors enthusiasts. Geothermic   wonders like the Mammoth Hot Springs, Old Faithful and Yellowstone Lake are not to be missed at this national park. With dramatic peaks and lakes, Yellowstone is an outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Multicolor1ed pools go around hot springs; green forests weave past wide meadows; and hot springs launch streams of steaming water toward the sky. With so much unspoiled natural beauty, there's no doubt that the park is indeed extraordinary. While you go across the park's 3,000-plus square miles of mountains, canyons, and waterfalls, be prepared to share the trails with permanent residents like buffalo, elk and sometimes even grizzlies.

        "question": "Most city parks are places where you can escape from big, ugly structures of metal and stone. The Manhattan High Line is different. Raised 25 feet above the ground, this large metal structure once supported a rail line. The line opened in 1934 to bring trains directly into factories. It was hardly used after the 1960s, and much of it was torn down. However, one part remained in a region of Manhattan called Chelsea. Chelsea was becoming high-class as restaurants, art galleries and apartments were built, but the ugly railway structure remained as _ . Everyone knew that at some time, it would have to be removed. But the High Line was not destroyed. In fact, now the old rail line serves as one of the most peaceful places in the city. It holds an elevated  park, with beautiful gardens and great views of the city. The idea to turn the rail line into a park came from Joshua David and Robert Hammond. In 1999, they attended a meeting to decide how to deal with the High Line. David and Hammond were the only people at the meeting interested in saving the historical structure. Later on, when they asked railway officials to take them up to look at the High Line, they saw a mile and a half of wild flowers growing in the middle of the city, and they realized that the High Line had potential  to become a park. There was growing interest in improving city centers, and so the project quickly developed and money for construction was easily collected. The first section of the High Line opened in 2009 and immediately became popular with tourists and locals alike. Each part of the park has a different atmosphere. Some areas are like balconies  with wonderful city views. Where the rail line goes between buildings, trees are thickly planted. Other sections have wide lawns  and walkways planted with wild flowers. Only the final section remains the way it has been for the last fifty years.

Beijing officials are now considering ways to help that process.Though giant fans are not on the menu, at least not yet, city planners are looking at ways to create corridors  that encourage wind flow through the capital.The plan is inspired by research on urban heat islands, which shows that large buildings that block the wind are one of the causes of higher average temperatures in cities as opposed to those in the countryside. \"This isn't controlling pollution.It's shifting the problem.\" Wang Bing, a Beijing-based author, wrote on Sina Weibo.But the plan has received some interest from residents who have grown tired of repeated periods of heavy pollution. Peng Yingdeng, an air pollution expert at the Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, told the newspaper that the plan was more likely to require an adjustment of related laws to limit building heights and numbers in some areas.Similar proposals are under consideration in other major Chinese cities including Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang and Wuhan. \"This kind of work to search for ways to reduce pollution is really worth applauding,\" the state-run news agency Xinhua said in a commentary.\"If scientists confirm it is effective, then we should promote it on a much larger scale.\" Some experts have expressed doubts whether the plan would make a significant difference.Serious pollution is usually associated with periods of little or no wind, and air corridors do little good if the wind isn't blowing, Song Guojun, an environmental science professor told The Beijing News.Solving the air pollution problem mainly requires controlling pollution sources.

        "question": "Soon computers and other machines will be able to remember you by looking at your eyes! The programme works because everyone's eyes are different. So in the future you won't have to remember a number when you want to use a machine or take money out of a bank. You'll just have to look at the machine and it will be able to tell who you are. The eye-recognition  programme is tested in shops and banks in the USA, Britain and Italy. Scientists are working on other systems, such as knowing you from the shape of your face or hand or even your smell! And machines can already tell who you are from your voice or your fingerprint . But eye-recognition will replace other ways of finding out who you are. It is better, because your eyes don't change as you get older, or get dirty like hands or fingers. And even twins have different eyes, so the programme can be up to 94% correct, depending on how good the technology is. In Britain, it was found that 91% of people said that they liked the idea of eye-recognition. ,. What problems could there be with the eye-recognition programme?",

        "question": "The phone ID flashed, \"Emergency Vet\". \"Oh no\" I whispered. I could not lose Merlin now. Ron and I had tried to have children for a long time with depressing results. I threw myself into my work. Any maternal feelings I had were spent on Merlin. I couldn't wait to get home from work each night. I wanted to pick up that warm bundle of loving fur and nestle him. I wanted to sing \"Rock-a-bye Merlin\", as I did every night as he would put his paws around my neck. Merlin was my comfort especially at times when I wondered if God was listening. But last night something had changed. Not only did I sing \"Rock-a-Bye Merlin\", but I asked, \"What will I do after you're gone?\" Although Merlin was 19 years old, a senior in the age of a cat, he didn't look or act that way. I didn't want to accept the fact that he was nearing the end of his lifetime. My job at the law firm was so demanding and stressful that I couldn't imagine getting through the day without Merlin waiting to greet me at home. I dialed the vet's number. I asked for my husband but he already left. Then I took a breath and asked the question that no one wants to ask, \"Is my Merlin still alive?\" The nurse said \"yes.\" Ron came home and said that Merlin had almost no red blood cells left. White blood cells were replacing them. Merlin would need expensive transfusions most likely on a monthly basis. We both knew Merlin was running out of time. I asked Ron to drive me to the vet so I could say goodbye to my little boy cat but he was beat tired and it was late. Ron said if Merlin was still alive the next morning then he would take me to the vet.  _ Merlin had survived the night. After driving to the vet, I went into the examining room. The nurse brought Merlin and placed him on an examining table on his side. His eyes were tightly shut. I thought he died already. I carefully edged my hand to reach his body. His body felt warm, but when I spoke his name there was no response. No response to his name or that I was there and that I loved him. I was extremely sad. In that examining room I felt helpless. I wondered how many people in an examining room felt as helpless as I did. Feeling driven to prayer I yelled, \"God this isn't good enough. I need to see my Merlin the way I remember him, I need a miracle and I need it now!\" At that moment, God granted a miracle. Merlin's favorite compliment entered my mind. I said, \"Merlin, You are Beautiful and You are Gorgeous, do you hear me?\" One eye opened. I said \"Gotcha\". I kept repeating those words. Merlin opened the other eye and, one limb at a time, got up. He was waiting for that phrase. He wanted to hear that he was beautiful and gorgeous again. Then I experienced another miracle. There was no sound in that examining room until Merlin started walking to me. From out of nowhere, or maybe from heaven, I clearly heard a song we sung in church often: \"It Is Well With My Soul.\" I remembered thinking, \"Yes, it is well with my Soul. I got to see my little boy cat one more time.\" Merlin walked to me. He put his face in mine, which he had never done before. He rubbed a circle around my face twice. Merlin said goodbye with his face and marked me for life. Ron appeared shocked that Merlin was up and had walked to me. I said to Merlin, \"Tell God you are a good boy and how much we love you\" and then handed him back to the nurse. Tears of gratitude poured forth in memory of a miracle. You see for nineteen years God spoke to me through a special cat named \"Merlin.\" On Merlin's last day, God proved he heard me when he granted a miracle. That miracle gave me time to say goodbye.

        "question": "If you want to stay young,sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise, and as a result,we are ageing unnecessarily soon.  Professor Taijiu Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern prefix = st1 /Japanappeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a  ly early age, and how the process of ageing could be slowed down. With a team of partners at Tokyo National University,he set about studying the brain volumes  of a thousand people of different ages and various jobs.  Computer technology enabled the researchers to get exact measurement of the volume  of the front and side sections of the brain,which relate to intellect and feelings,and determine the human character. The back section of the brain,which controls functions like eating or breathing,does not connect with age. One can continue living without intellectual or feeling abilities.  Contraction of front and side parts - as cells die off - was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not obvious in some sixty and seventy year olds.  Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple cure for the contraction normally connected with age using the brain.  The findings show in general conditions that contraction of the brain begins soon among people in the country than in the town. Those are at least at risk,says Matsuzawa,who are lawyers,followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing regular work in government offices are, however,as likely to have shrink   as the farm workers,bus drivers and shop assistants.  Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must flow through a circle properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. \"The best way to keep good blood movement is through using the brain,\"he says. \" Think hard and engage in conversation. Don't depend on pocket calculators. \" According to the passage,which people seem to age slower than the others?",

It means that we should go to bed early at night and get up early in the morning. If we do, we shall be healthy. We shall also be rich and clever. Is this true? Perhaps it is. The body must have enough sleep. Children of your age need ten hours' sleep every night. If you do not go to bed early, you can not have enough sleep. Then you can not think properly and you can not do your work properly. You will not be wise and you may not become wealthy! Some people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is not good for them. We should sleep at night when it is dark. The dark helps us to sleep well. When the daylight comes, we should get up. This is the time for exercise. If the body is not used, it will become weak. Exercise keeps it strong. Exercise helps the blood to move around inside the body. This is very important. Blood takes nutrition   to all parts of our bodies. The brains in our heads also need blood. We think with our brains. If we keep our bodies healthy, and take exercise, we can think better!

We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, for man is slowly changing all the time. Let us take an obvious example. Man, even five hundred years ago , was shorter than he is today. Now, on average,  men are about three inches taller. Five hundred years is a relatively short period of time, so we may assume that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modem world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still make use of only about 20% of the brain' s capacity . As time goes on , however , we shall have to use our brains more and more,  and eventually we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring about a physical change too: the head, in particular the forehead, will grow larger. Nowadays our eyes are in constant use. In fact , we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a very long period of time it is likely that man' s eyes will grow stronger. On the other hand, we tend to make less use of our arms and legs. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however , our fingers will grow more sensitive  because they are used a great deal in modern life. But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both sexes are likely to be bald. Perhaps all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive creature to look at! This may well be true.

        "question": "Education plays a very important role in everybody's life. We go to school because we want to know more about the world around us. The typical classroom used to be the place where teachers and students were working and exploring the wonderful world of knowledge together, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one of those approaches. Learning via the Internet is a new style that seems to become successful than the traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a large amount of learning material that is accessible to students online. Owing to the choices of courses online, completing a program becomes much easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spend hours searching for the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, being a first time mother, I find that using information online is very helpful. While I am at home with my baby, I can still search for the material I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my house. The Internet is not only a big information provider but also a money and time saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future because of Internet access to information. The cost of land, building and wages for teachers are continuously increasing. In addition, regular courses (offline) depend heavily on books and other paper-based materials, while online education posts lectures, and assignments electronically, which saves thousands of dollars every year. With no physical restrictions, the Internet classes and courses are also very convenient. In classroom-based education there is a limitation on the number of students while Internet education is available to everyone. Students don't have to struggle in order to register for classes they like.  Students will have more choices to take their courses and classes online. The Internet offers a wonderful opportunity to obtain knowledge in a more convenient and less expensive way. In my opinion, online life in the future is simply inescapable.

Place: Comedy Theatre The Children's Hour The Children's Hour by Lillian Hellman is a striking play about the power of a lie. Karen Wright (Keira Knightley) and Martha Dobie (Elisabeth Moss) run a girls' boarding school in the 1930s New England. When an angry student starts a rumour that the two headmistresses are having a lesbian   affair, it gradually destroys the women's careers, relationships and lives. The Children's Hour is an upsetting story of cheat, shame and courage. Banned in London and several cities across America, The Children's Hour received its world opening on Broadway in 1934. Generations on, its exploration of a culture of fear remains remarkably relevant. Keira Knightley and Elisabeth Moss Star Keira Knightley, nominee   for Best Actress 2010 Evening Standard Awards for The Misanthrope, returns to the London stage. Knightley starred in Love Actually, The Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy, Pride and Prejudice.

        "question": "Zoology is the part of science that deals with the study of the animals' growth, home and behavior. It has nothing to do with people, so many students are left wondering why they have to learn it. Our nature includes not just humans but plants and animals as well. Everything in our environment is connected in a complex cycle. If you have a better understanding of how animals would behave and work with us, then you would value nature better. Some animals are actually misunderstood by people like sharks and snakes. These creatures are thought of as human killers, and this is mainly because we don't understand why they behave that way. In zoology you would be able to learn natural behavior as well as their homes so you would completely understand why they would behave in a defensive  manner when they seem to be threatened. Studying zoology would help people achieve clearness over the common myths we have on different wild animals. Studying zoology would help people know the real facts about animals. One of the negative facts is the decreasing numbers of some species of animals. It makes people realize that there is a need for nature to be always balanced. We need animals to keep the balance in our environment and for humans to survive as well. It would help us learn the needs that animals lack and we can respond by thinking of solutions we can give to the endangered species of animals. Modern progress is needed for a country to grow in terms of its economy; however, it should not force us to destroy our rainforests and oceans. People should realize that our modern lives should include the lives of the animals that live with us. They should not be contained in zoos but in their natural homes as well. We will learn that every living creature on the earth has the right to own a home and we need to fight for them to have permanent  homes. The best title for the passage may be \"  _  \".",

        "question": "The world has changed and being intelligent isn't normally equal to being a successful person. Look at the example of the blue whale: it has a huge brain, but it still doesn't know how to avoid whalers or use its large size and weight to deal with those who try to use their body for profit. Scientists hold an opinion that the blue whale is just like some highly intelligent people who fail to succeed. Those highly intelligent people can't succeed in life because they can't communicate well with the world around them. Intelligence is a word in life that makes you think you are better than others. Intelligence can blind these very people from how others view them. These people also think that the route to power and success results purely from intelligence and they sometimes live in a fantasy world that they create by their supposed brain power.  This is a distance that develops whether or not they realize it and sometimes, a person can be disliked simply because of his or her intelligence. This distance is sometimes so far apart that it gets to the position where they can't listen to each other. One side thinks the other is stupid and the other thinks he/she is haughty . And most of the time it is the intelligent people who lose themselves in this situation. They become unpopular with most of the people around them. This affects them in whatever they do and sooner or later they will lose their confidence.  It doesn't help that they get a culture shock --- especially when they leave college and realize success and richness don't always and sometimes never come naturally with intelligence. While some might think this is a dramatic picture to paint, it is sometimes the end result of some people. We can infer that the end result of the supposed intelligent people would be   _  .",

        "question": "Wisconsin has long been home to incredibly successful research and innovation thanks to our famous academic research institutions and some of the brightest scientific minds. From discovering how Vitamin D can best be absorbed, to unlocking the potential of stem cells, Wisconsin has pioneered remarkable breakthroughs in science that have improved health, saved lives and created jobs. These scientific breakthroughs have not only led to life-saving medical technologies but also have fostered   a strong power in Wisconsin economy. Across America, groundbreaking research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone adds millions of dollars to our economy every year. In fact, NIH funding generated an estimated $58 billion in economic output nationwide in 2014. NIH funding spurs economic growth by supporting jobs in research and by generating biomedical innovations that are turned into new products. NIH-supported innovations also influence improvements in health that can bolster the economy, improve productivity, and reduce illness and disability at home and across the globe. But, budget cuts and inadequate funding for NIH in the past decade have put both medical innovation and our next generation of researchers at risk. Today, too many of our talented young scientists are deciding to do something else, or are leaving the country to pursue their research. Simply put, scientific and medical innovation depends on our ability to foster, support and invest in these new researchers. That is why I have worked across party lines with Senator Susan Collins of Maine and introduced the Next Generation (NextGen) Researchers Act. Our act builds opportunities for new researchers, helps address the debt burden that young scientists face today, and invests in the future of research, science, and innovation. This commonsense proposal would create the \"Next Generation Researchers Initiative\" within the NIH Office of the Director to coordinate   all current and new NIH policies. The legislation   also directs the NIH to consider recommendations from a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) comprehensive study and report on fostering the next generation of researchers. Finally, we must demonstrate a commitment to our future scientists who, like so many of their peers pursuing other fields, are struggling with crushing student loan debt. Our plan would also increase the amount of loans that can be forgiven through the NIH's loan repayment programs to better account for the current debt load of new scientists. Higher education should be a path to prosperity, not suffocating debt, and this provision not only helps make higher education more affordable, but can help give new researchers a fair shot at pursuing their dreams. The Next Gen Researchers Act will help to empower our next generation of researchers from Maine to Wisconsin, and across our country, with the resources they need to continue to lead the world in groundbreaking biomedical research and development. I'm proud to have earned the support of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Medical College of Wisconsin, and many others, for my bipartisan work supporting Wisconsin's leadership in science, research and innovation. At a time when America's young researchers are facing the worst funding in decades, our best and brightest minds deserve to know that our country stands with them and is committed to building a stronger future.

It also notes a large increase in the number of international students form China. These findings are from the latest edition  of the Open Doors Report.    The report tells the record number of international students in the United States during the 2011-2012 school year. It says more than 764,400 such students were attending American colleges and universities during that period. That means an increase of almost 6% compared to one year earlier. By comparison  ,the number of Americans who are studying overseas increased by 1%.    The report says 194,000 students at American colleges and universities are from China. That is an increase of more than 23% over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal is an assistant to the president of the Institute of International Education. She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America.\" We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world that they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their destination of choice.\" She says.    Chinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities . After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education. India has about 100,000 students in American schools. South Korea is third with about 70,000 students.    Why do so many foreign students study in the United States ? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason. \" The advantage America has is that we have a huge system and a very diverse   system. So there are over four thousand universities and colleges in the United States, and what it tells us is that there is still a lot of room to contain international students.\" Why do so many students choose to study in America according to Peggy Blumenthal?",

Keep stairs well lighted and clear of things for someone to trip over. Fasten down loose rugs. Turn handles of pots inward from the edges of stoves. Keep matches and medicines out of the reach of small children.Keep electric wiring in good repair. Safety at work has been getting attention from groups of people for many years. Safer machines have been built to cut down on accidents.  Red  lights  warn  when equipment is out of order and is not to be used. The proper shoes, gloves, robes, hats, or coats help protect workers on the job. Safety at play is important, too. Children should use swings and slides properly. Common sense by people boating and swimming will also help everyone around stay safe. Good manners and care for others are part of safety.

So the man decided to help the butterfly.He cut off the remaining bit of the cocoon so that the butterfly would come out easily.But to his surprise, the butterfly got a heavy body and very small wings when it came out of the cocoon.

In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a heavy body and small wings.It was never able to fly. The man was in his kindness, but he didn't understand the nature rules.Before the butterfly came out of the cocoon, fluid  from its body must be forced into its wings, and then would be ready for flying.It must have a hard struggle  to get through the small opening to get its freedom from the cocoon.

Now John Edwards is exploring what makes a house a home in his just-released Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. There Edwards writes, \"This is a book about homes, the values they rest on, the dreams they are filled with, and the people they have shaped. The houses and circumstances are different, but much of what you find inside will be familiar.\"  Whether you're sitting in an airport right now, waiting to fly to your childhood home for Thanksgiving, or in your own home waiting for the  s to arrive, you know what he's talking about.   We've lived in our townhouse for 21 years. The loose windows make noise in the wind. The fireplace is so shallow it holds only one log. The kitchen window offers a view of the world passing by. It's where friends sit on the kitchen counter drinking wine while dinner is being fixed. I lived there for only 18 years, but it will always be my true home. Even the lamp in the west living room window, which I could see far down the road when driving home late at night, still shines.

        "question": "The common cold is the world's most widespread illness, which is plagues  that flesh receives. The most widespread mistake of all is that colds are caused by cold. They are not. They are caused by viruses  passing on from person to person. You catch a cold by coming into contact, directly or indirectly, with someone who already has one. If cold causes colds, it would be reasonable to expect the Eskimos to suffer from them forever. But they do not. And in isolated Arctic regions explorers have reported being free from colds until coming into contact again with infected people from the outside world by way of packages and mail dropped from airplanes. During the First World War soldiers who spent long periods in the trenches , cold and wet, showed no increased tendency to catch colds. In the Second World War prisoners at the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp , naked and starving, were astonished to find that they seldom had colds. At the Common Cold Research Unit in England, volunteers took part in Experiments in which they gave themselves to the discomforts of being cold and wet for long stretches of time. After taking hot baths, they put on bathing suits, allowed themselves to be with cold water, and then stood about dripping wet in drafty room. Some wore wet socks all day while others exercised in the rain until close to exhaustion. Not one of the volunteers came down with a cold unless a cold virus was actually dropped in his nose. If, then, cold and wet have nothing to do with catching colds, why are they more frequent in the winter? Despite the most pains--taking research, no one has yet found the answer. One explanation offered by scientists is that people tend to stay together indoors more in cold weather than at other times, and this makes it easier for cold viruses to be passed on. No one has yet found a cure for the cold. There are drugs and pain suppressors  such as aspirin, but all they do is to relieve the symptoms .

Looking westward, Nash saw twelve orange lights in a row, moving at a very high rate of speed. Thinking they might be a new German weapon, he swung the plane around and headed directly for the lights, but they disappeared. Captain Nash may have been the first to see such orange lights but he wasn't the last. His experience was repeated many times by pilots during World War II both in England and Far East. What were they? No one knows for sure, but there is an interesting theory to explain them. According to this theory, the orange lights are space animals---animals specially adapted   to life in the upper atmosphere just as some living things are adapted to life at the bottom of the sea. These space animals, the theory says, live so far up in the atmosphere that they are not in sight from the earth. They feed partly on the air and partly on energy from the sunlight. Being almost pure energy themselves, their body shine at night. During the day, however, they are invisible. Before World War II, continues the theory, there was little radiated energy on the earth's surface. Then came the development of rockets, nuclear power stations and something like that. The space animals are attracted to these kinds of energy of food. At night when there is no energy from the sunlight, they come down into the lower levels in search of a meal. They may even float into the range of human eyesight. This explains the fact that they have been sighted many times from the earth since 1943.

For example, poorer children think coins are larger than they are, and hungry people think pictures of food are brighter. Professor Remi Radel wanted to investigate(look into) how this happens -- whether it's right away, as the brain receives signals from the eyes, or a little later, as the brain's higher-level thinking processes get involved. Radel chose 42 students and each student was told to arrive at the lab at noon after three or four hours of not eating on the day of the test. Then they were told there was a delay. Some were told to come back in 10 minutes; others were given an hour to get lunch. So half the students were hungry when they did the experiment and the other half had just eaten. For the experiment, the participant looked at a computer screen. One by one, 80 words flashed on the screen. A quarter of the words were food-related. After each word, the person was asked how bright the word was and asked to choose which of two words they'd seen -- a food-related word like gateau (cake) or a neutral   word like bateau (boat). Hungry people saw the food-related words as brighter and were better at identifying food-related words. Because the word appeared too quickly for them to be reliably seen, this means that the difference is in perception  , Radel says--it's not because of some kind of processing happening in the brain after you've already figured out what you're looking at. \"This is something great to me, that humans can really realize what they need or what they hope for, to know that our brain can really arrange for our motives and needs,\" Radel says. \"There is something inside us that selects information in the world to make life easier.\" Which of the following is true about the experiment?",

        "question": "Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand (  ) of hair, a technique that could help track the movements of criminal suspects or unidentified murder victims.    The method relies on measuring how chemical variations in drinking water show up in people's hair.    \"You're what you eat and drink, and that's recorded in your hair,\" said Thure Cerling, a geologist at the University of Utah.   While U.S. diet is  ly identical, water supplies vary. The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as rain clouds move.    Most hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable, but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes (  ). The heaviest rain falls first. As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah.    Similar patterns exist throughout the U.S. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months. Cerling's team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a map of the regional difference. They checked the accuracy of the map by testing 200 hair samples collected from 65 barber shops. They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad region roughly corresponding to the movement of rain systems.    \"It's not good for pinpointing (  ),\" Cerling said. \"It's good for eliminating many possibilities.\"    Todd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near Great Salt Lake. The woman was 5 feet tall. Police recovered 26 bones, a T-shirt and several strands of hair. When Park heard about the research, he gave the hair samples to the researches. Chemical testing showed that over the two years before her death, she moved about every two months. She stayed in the Northwest, although the test could not be more specific than somewhere between eastern Oregon and western Wyoming.    \"It's still a substantial area,\" Park said, \"But it narrows its way down for me.\" What is said about the rainfall in America's West?",

        "question": "If you are looking to putting a tree in your home for Christmas, there is always one debate that seems to arise in most households: whether you want a real tree or fake tree. Year after year, as we find ourselves cleaning old pine needles   for months on end, we decide that we will never get another real tree. So that begs the question: Which kind of tree is better? There is certainly a lot to be said for real trees. There is something fun about gathering the family together, going to a Christmas tree farm, and selecting or even cutting down your own tree. Real Christmas trees have that lovely holiday pine needle smell and they look great in your home. Of course, on the other hand, they also leave a complete mess behind and needles that seem to keep appearing for weeks or even months after the tree comes down. You must also find a way to deal with your real Christmas tree after you're done, which may mean cutting it into pieces so it will fit in the trash. Many dustmen will refuse to take away a tree that is left beside your regular trash, especially if it is a big tree or an old, yellow one with falling needles, making it hard to pick up. They don't want a face full of sharp needles any more than you do! With a fake Christmas tree, there is no mess, but there is also no Christmas smell and no exciting trip to the Christmas tree farm. Of course, these trees look the same in appearance as a real tree when decorated. _ For some people, a can of pine air freshener is enough to recreate the pleasant smell of a real tree. As to which tree is the better choice, it is really a matter of personal preference. Both real and fake trees certainly have their benefits, and knowing which is better for you this Christmas really depends on what your family wants.

As a preschooler can tell you, repetition can lead to pleasure. When you experience something more than once, you notice more details about it each time, and it increases your enjoyment. That's why you love revisiting that jazz club, favourite restaurant, and beloved old Woody Allen movie. Of course, you can overdo it. Don't buy boxed sets of DVDs. Economist  Tyler says that much of the joy we get from our buying lies in the experience of finding them out, getting them home, and opening them up. If you receive 18 DVDs in one package, you'll use up the excitement all at once. Buy things one a time and space out the pleasure. Look outside. People long ago spent almost all of their time outside with trees, water, and sky around. The world in which most of us spend our time nowadays is unnatural and can harm the spirit. Even being close to nature for a short time can make us happy.  _ . Physical contact with animals works wonders. You can pet an animal. It increases the brain chemicals connected with pleasure and decreases those connected with stress . Even people without pets can get some of the effect by hanging out for a few minutes at a dog shelter. Smile. Well, like it or not, smiling improves your mood. Here's why: people react better to you when you look happy, which in turn leads you to be happy. What's more, looking happy fools your brain into thinking that you are happy.

Every September 22, governments, green groups and ordinary citizens stress the damage cars are doing to the earth. The day is a reminder that we do not need to rely so much on cars. Those who take part in the activity hope that we all should realize we do not have to accept our car-controlled society.     Carlos Pardo from Colombia's Sustainable Urban Transport Project said, \"World Car Free Day is not only a celebration of fun ways to get around the city, but a demonstration of traffic-free streets and clean air is possible. But we do not want just one day of celebration and then a return to normal life. When people get out of their cars, they should stay out of their cars. It is up to us, our cities and our governments to help create lasting change to benefit walkers, cyclists and other people who do not drive cars. \"     Car-free days were organized as early as during the 1970s, and several car-free days were organized in European cities during the early 1990s. An international car-free day was organized in Europe in 1999. The European Union adopted the idea in 2000. Today, as many as 100 million people in over 1500 cities worldwide celebrate this day.     World Car Free Day aims to take a large number of cars off the streets for all or part of a day. This will give people a chance to see what their town might look like with fewer cars.

        "question": "It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, CA. Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous.  On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car.  While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude. If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else.  This kindness spreads. Someone does something nice for you and in turn you're likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else.  A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect.

        "question": "Cell phones:  is there a cancer link? Could your cell phone give you cancer? Whether it could or not, some people are worrying about the possibility that phones, power lines and Wi-Fi could be responsible for a range of illnesses, from rashes to brain tumors. Some say there is evidence to support the growing anxieties. David Carpenter, a professor of environmental health sciences at the university at Albany, in New York, thinks there's a greater than 95 percent chance that power lines can cause childhood leukemia . Also there's a greater than 90 percent chance that cell phones can cause brain tumors. \"It's apparent now that there's a real risk, \" said Carpenter. But others believe these concerns are unjustified. Dr Martha Linet, the head of radiation epidemiology  at the US National Cancer Institute, has looked at the same research as Carpenter but has reached a different conclusion. \"I don't support warning labels for cell phones, \" said Linet. \"We don't have the evidence that there's much danger. \" Studies so far suggest a weak connection between EMFs  and illness-- so weak that it might not exist at all. A multinational investigation of cell phones and brain cancer, in 13 countries outside the US, has been underway for several years. It's funded in part by the European Union, in part by a cell phone industry group.

Shanghai Disneyland is expected to open in 2016, bringing Disney's popular parks here to the Chinese mainland for the first time. So why has Disneyland been so popular for 60 years?

Many Americans have grown up with the parks, as ex--Disneyland president Paul Pressler said in 1995: \"There is an emotional relationship that people have with this park.\" Disneyland was one of the first theme parks anywhere in the world that had \"lands\" and rides with themes. Disney's storytelling in rides like roller coasters  is a big reason for their parks' success. \"We tell a story in everything we do,\" Pressler said. Disney rides such as The seven Dwarves Mine Train and Peter Pan's Flight come from its movies. One ride from its 2013 hit movie Frozen will surely be coming soon, perhaps at the new Shanghai Disneyland. Disney's parks haven't always been popular everywhere, however. When Disneyland Paris opened in 1992, some French people felt that American culture was invading France. But still, the park stayed open and today it is a popular place for European visitors.

While Nora's mother, Martha, loves sitting down with a good book and reading carefully, her daughter may be the wave of the future. \"Deep reading\", or slow reading, is a process in which people think carefully while they read. With most, that means slowing down --- even stopping and rereading a page or paragraph to really understand what the author is trying to say. Last summer, Google CEO Eric Schmidt said he was concerned about what he sees as a decline in slow reading. Instant messages and 140-character tweets appear to be reducing out ability to concentrate on a single idea or theme of a book, he told Foreign Policy Magazine. It's easy to forget the benefits of deep reading in an age when anything worth doing is done fast. Experts warn that without deep reading, it is impossible to be an educated person of the world, a knowledgeable voter or even an imaginative thinker. \"If you want to have a deep relationship with a text and understand a complex idea, then slow reading is a preferred style. It is good for pleasure, too. It is not a rushed experience and you can lose yourself in a text,\" said Canadian writer John Miedema, the author of the book Slow Reading. US' Ohlone College English professor Cynthia Lee Katona says reading is a highly social activity that builds the mind and social connections. If you read, she says, you simply know more and have more to talk about with friends, partners and people you know. Deep reading can also take a reader on a trip around the world even if they are sitting in a living room armchair, Katona says. Also, deep reading helps people develop thinking, writing and conversation skills. \"If you like beautiful things, authors put words together that are really beautiful and expressive,\" she says. \"If you want to write well--- and there are lots of reasons to express yourself clearly --- you should read.\" The comparison between Nora and her mother's reading habits   _  .",

        "question": "More than 200 scientists have completed a twoyear study to identify the most natural and undeveloped areas on Earth. Their findings are reported in a new book called Wilderness:Earth's Last Wild Places. The book describes 37 wilderness areas around the world. Each has an area greater than 10,000 square kilometers. The study considered only areas where at least 70% of all plants are native. North and South America are home to the largest number of wilderness areas. There are 16 such areas, from southern Argentina to Alaska and northern Canada. Africa has 8 wilderness areas, including the thick forests and the grasslands. Australia and New Guinea   share 6 areas. Europe has 3 areas and Asia has 2.The Arabian Desert and Antarctica also are considered wilderness areas. The largest wilderness area is the Boreal Forest  .It extends for 16million square kilometers south of the Arctic Circle. The Boreal Forest extends across Alaska, Canada, northern Europe and Russia. The smallest of the 37 wilderness areas is the Sundarbans. It is the world's largest tidal mangrove forest  .It covers 10,000 square kilometers of land at the mouth of the Ganges River in India and Bangladesh  . The study found that wilderness areas cover about 46% of the Earth's land surface. However, they are home to less than 2.5% of the world's population. Nineteen of the wilderness areas have only about one person for each square kilometer. Native people usually live in these areas. Wilderness areas help to influence the world's weather systems and rainfall. They are also home to many plants and animals. Population growth and the spread of agriculture and mining operations threaten wilderness areas. But just 7% of all such areas have some form of official protection. The purpose of writing this text is to tell us    _   of the wilderness areas around the world.",

The young people began to wonder about him , trying to imagine his life. One of the girls sat beside him and introduced herself. After a long time, slowly and painfully, he began to tell his story. He had been in prison in prefix = st1 /New Yorkfor the last four years, and now he was going home.        \"Well, when I was in prison I wrote to my wife. I said, 'Martha, I understand if you can not stay married to me'.

My husband and I stayed with him for the weekend but had to return to our jobs on Monday. Local relatives would help Dad get home from hospital and look after him. But I longed to be able to let him know that we cared about him too, even when we weren't with him. Then I remembered a family tradition when our children were small. When leaving our grandparents' home after a visit, each child would write a love note to their grandparents. We hid notes in a box, under a hairbrush or next to the phone or even in the microwave oven. For days, our grandparents would smile as they discovered these reminders of our love. So as I tidied Dad's kitchen and made up a bed for him downstairs in the living room, I wrote some notes. Some were practical, \"Dad, I put the food in the fridge so it wouldn't spoil\". Some expressed my love, \"Dad, I hope you will sleep well in your new bed.\" Most notes were downstairs where he would stay for several weeks until he recovered strength, but one note I hid upstairs under his pillow, \"Dad, if you have found this note, you must be feeling better. We are so glad!\" Just like his medicine strengthened him physically, these \"emotional vitamins\" would improve his spiritual health. Several weeks later, in one of our regular phone calls, I asked Dad how he was doing. He said, \"Pretty good.

These seven kids, all under the age of 20, are members of the band Kids These Days (KTD). Fresh out of high school, the band already has done things that most teens couldn't even imagine. They played at festivals including the recent SXSW in Austin and Lollapalooza in their hometown, Chicago, to crowds of loyal fans. KTD uses a mix of hip-hop, jazz, blues and classic rock to make a sound of their own. \"KTD simply mixes most, if not all of my favourite music styles,\" said Kamia Jones, as Chicago high school student.\"I like that they aren't afraid to be different and that their music is real and speaks to the soul.\" The band formed two years ago. Now, as well as local fans, they are becoming popular around the world. Their facebook page is filled with supportive posts from admirers from California to Tokyo. \"It's really strange to me that people from London, Australia and Russia... They have heard of us and they like our music because it's really cool feeling,\" says Marcie Stewart, who plays keyboard for the band. Despite their recent fame, KTD is a group of normal teenagers and they remain very close to one another. While talking to the reporters, they dance and make fun of each other. When asked what advice they would give to other teen musicians, Greg Landfair, KTD's drummer, said, \"Keep your heart in it. Never lose the music and what you are doing, because that's what you're here for. Let the music always be first.\" What do we know about KTD?",

One day, he gathered up all his strength and decided to attend a job interview. His appointment was at 10 am and it was already 8:30. While waiting for a bus to the office where he was supposed to be interviewed, he saw an elderly man wildly kicking the tyre of his car. Obviously there was something wrong with the car. Jimmy immediately went up to lend him a hand. When Jimmy finished working on the car, the old man asked him how much he should pay for the service. Jimmy said there was no need to pay him; he just helped someone in need, and he had to rush for an interview. Then the old man said, \"Well, I could take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please, I insist.\" Jimmy agreed. Upon arrival, Jimmy found a long line of applicants waiting to be interviewed. Jimmy still had some grease on him after the car repair, but he did not have much time to wash it off or have a change of shirt. One by one, the applicants left the interviewer's office with disappointed look on their faces. Finally his name was called. The interviewer was sitting on a large chair facing the office window. Rocking the chair back and forth, he asked, \"Do you really need to be interviewed?\" Jimmy's heart sank. \"With the way I look now, how could I possibly pass this interview?\" he thought to himself. Then the interviewer turned the chair and to Jimmy's surprise, it was the old man he helped earlier in the morning. It turned out he was the General Manager of the company. \"Sorry I had to keep you waiting, but I was pretty sure I made the right decision to have you as part of our workforce before you even stepped into the office.

Smart home technology will allow all sorts of electronics and appliances  to be able to communicate with each other and perform various tasks. Whenever someone wants to have a snack, but does not feel like making something, why not have the refrigerator suggest something based on what it has inside of it. Not only that, it would communicate with the microwave to prepare the cooking power and time for that particular dish.    Nearly all major appliances in the future will take advantage of this technology through home networks and the Internet. Smart home technology is a way for ordinary electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, consumers, and even manufacturers. Many consider a smart home to be one that is networked. Others feel it is a home that has appliances that will allow the consumer to do little or no work, but a smart home really is all of that combined, and more. Not only will all consumer products be networked, but they will also make life easier and more entertaining. Smart home technology is currently being developed and carried out for all rooms in the house, in particular the kitchen and the living room.   Many of today's products are becoming \"smart.\" Kitchen refrigerators, microwaves, and stoves are using this technology. Even washers and dryers have the technology today to be more automated  to fit people's needs. Products in the bathroom will even start to use smart home technology.

        "question": "Last year, Jack Bleed cut through the bone of his ring finger while working. The 31-year-old resident of North Little Rock, Arkansas, waited for about six hours at a nearby medical center while the medical staff there called all over town -- even as far away as Dallas and Memphis -- to find a hand surgeon to reattach his finger. Finally, a willing doctor was located in Louisville, Kentucky. But even though Bleed had insurance , he would have to hire a private plane to get himself there, at a cost of $4,300. In the end, he charged the cost to two credit cards, and his finger was saved. His insurance company eventually covered the cost of the plane, but his experience makes people aware of the fact that trauma  care in the United States is not only geographically limited, but in many places, non-existent. Only eight states -- New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, New Mexico, California, Oregon, and Washington -- have local, fully functional trauma systems. The remaining states have partial systems, and 12 -- including Arkansas -- have no trauma system at all. Although the President has signed a bill of $12 million for the purpose of supporting trauma care systems nationwide, many in Congress  are unwilling to spend government money for a service they think should be paid for by states, says Wayne Meredith, medical director for trauma programs at the American College of Surgeons. Meanwhile, many states have also failed to find the dollars to support trauma systems. To make matters worse, many people without insurance depend heavily on the emergency care services, placing a huge financial burden on the medical centers that serve them. For the same reason, doctors, too, often go unpaid. They are unwilling to perform emergency care, worsening critical shortages of neurosurgeons, orthopedists, and hand surgeons -- the very types of specialists Bleed needed at short notice. Supporting a trauma care system doesn't take much. A half-penny sales tax in Miami-Dade County makes its outstanding system work. In Arkansas alone, says Wayne Meredith, a well-funded trauma system would possibly prevent 200 to 600 deaths each year. If trauma care systems were to work well across the nation, experts say, many thousands of lives each year could be saved. \"You don't get much better return on your investment than that,\" Meredith says.

My main goal was to relax in preparation for the challenges of my retirement in the coming year. Through my stay in Montreal, I met lots of Chinese who are struggling to succeed and then lead a better life in Canada. Some travelled thousands of miles to get knowledge. When I spoke with some of them about the major barrier they had to face after they arrived in Canada, they all talked about the two official languages of Canada. But I was impressed by their ability to express their ideas while switching between English and French. Almost all of those people said they often felt homesick. They miss their families and friends. Though Montreal has lots of Chinese restaurants, they long for a home-cooked meal. I met some tourists who were trying to realize their childhood dreams of experiencing the life in a developed country. When I asked them if Montreal had lived up to their expectations, they hesitated. They said that reality never agrees with fantasies. However, they were glad to have the opportunity to visit Montreal and didn't regret taking the trip. Not all the Chinese people I met were happy. I once met a young lady who met with a gentleman through the Internet. However, to her disappointment, he disappeared after he promised to marry her in Montreal. I was served by another Chinese person who could not handle the challenges of studying in an English environment and ended up working in a restaurant with minimum pay. Exploring different parts of the world, without any doubt, is an enriching experience. However, one should be realistic when it comes to leaving his hometown to set up a new life in a foreign country. One should take the time to examine the advantages and the shortcomings of the venture before they decide to chase an uncertain dream of achieving success or leading a better life.

        "question": "Have you ever wondered what goes through your mind when you choose where to sit in a new classroom? Or in a waiting room full of strangers? Or on a bus? Researchers have found out some interesting facts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we prefer to sit closer to people like ourselves. Girls sit by girls and boys sit by boys. Adults sit together and young people choose another young person to sit near. But it goes further than this. We even choose to sit near someone who looks like us. People with glasses are more likely to sit near other people with glasses. People with long hair sit closer to other people with long hair. We seem to believe that people with similar habits or hobbies will share similar attitude and we are more likely to be accepted by people like ourselves or even, we think we may be safer with people who look like us. Sometimes that's true but it's a pity if we always stick to the same people, the same group. The danger in always staying in our comfort zone  is that we just recycle the same opinions, the same tastes and the same ideas. We lose the chance to learn something new, find out about interesting things, hear funny stories and discover difference. When we always stick to the same people, how can we ever break down the barriers which prevent us from getting to know people with different ideas? And how can we avoid the ignorance  ,which too often leads to prejudice   and even fear? If instead you want to live in a society that opens to changes and new things and different opinions, be the cat among the pigeons. Move out of your comfort zone. Go and sit next to someone different. And don't just sit there in silence. Say hello. Ask a question. Start a conversation. That's how we make friends. That's how we learn about people. That's how we open our minds to new ideas. That's how we live an exciting life. People like staying in their comfort zone because they may",

During school,her parents took her to Italy to explore the country's many cultural treasures. One of the private art collections Isabella visited in Milan had a deep influence on her. She wrote to her friends about her dream of owning a house one day with an art collection like the one she had seen in Italy. In Paris, Isabella became a close friend of one of her classmates, Julia Gardner, whose family was from Boston. Julia would later introduce Isabella to her brother, Jack. In 1860, Isabella Stewart married Jack Gardner. The couple had too much art to fit inside their home. So they decided to start planning a museum. Mrs. Gardner didn't like the cold and empty spaces of many museums during her time. She wanted a warm museum filled with light. She once said that she decided years ago that _ . America was a young country developing quickly in other areas. But the country needed more chances for people to see beautiful examples of art. After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised  every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston.

        "question": "Regarded as one of the English language's most gifted poets, John Keats wrote poetry that concentrated on imagery, human nature, and philosophy. Although Keats didn't receive much formal literary education, his own studies and passion brought him much success. Additionally, his own life situation influenced his poetry greatly. Growing up as a young boy in London in a lower middle-class family, the young John didn't attend a private school, but went to a public one. His teachers and his family's friends regarded him as an optimistic boy who favored playing and fighting much more than minding his studies. After his father's death in the early 1800s, followed by his mother's passing due to tuberculosis  , he began viewing life differently. He wanted to escape the world and did so by reading anything he could get his hands on. At around the age of 16, the teenage John Keats began studying under a surgeon so that he too might become a doctor. However, his literary appetite had taken too much of his fancy, especially with his addiction to the poetry of Ehmund Spenser. He was able to have his first full poem published in the Examiner in 1816, entitled O Solitude! If I Must With Thee Dwell. Within two months in 1817, Keats had written an entire volume of poetry, but was sharply criticized by a magazine. However, the negative response didn't stop his pursuit of rhythm  . John Keats' next work was Endymion, which was published in May 1818. The story involves a shepherd who falls in love with the moon goddess and leads him on an adventure of one boy's hope to overcome the limitations of being human. Following Engymion, however, he tried something more narrative-based and wrote Isabella. During this time, John Keats began seeing his limitations in poetry due to his own limit in life experiences. He would have to have the \"knowledge\" associated with his poems. His next work was Hyperion that would attempt to combine all that he learned. However, a bout   with tuberculosis while visiting Italy would keep him from his work and eventually take his life in 1821. What do we know from the passage?",

But experts are now warning that the current shoe fashions will be causing teenagers discomfort in the short term and storing up years of foot, knee and back pain in the future. Here, the experts identify the problems caused by teenagers' shoe choice. KEDS/VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are particularly popular among teenage boys-with Keds and Vans the most sought-after brands. The main problem is that they are just too flat--so flat that the heel, which strikes the ground first, also becomes damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are such light and thin dolly shoes. The problem is partly their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However ballet pumps, which have no string or heel, have other specific problems. \"As the shoe has no fastening device, it relies on the toes to keep the shoe on, causing an awkward gait ,this leads to short-and long-term problems such as calluses ,heel and knee pain.\" WEDGES AND STILETTOS      These shoes can also cause problems with gait, They may look good, but the heels on these are so high they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teens who wear these shoes regularly are also in danger of joining those millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES      So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday wear? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a string to hold it on, with a small heel and a deep toe-box that does not press the toes, such as Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing 'bad' shoes, get them some simple foot orthotics in the shoes. These support and correct the movement of the foot and, properly fitted by a podiatrist, can often transform their walk and halt the damage. From this passage we can infer_.",

His wife, Gerrie, was still working in the local school cafeteria, but it was hard for Dave to find work, and the price of everything was rising. The Fusses were at risk of joining the millions of Americans who have lost their homes in recent years. Then Dave and Gerrie received a timely gift--$7,000, a legacy  from their neighbors Ish and Arlene Hatch, who died in an accident. \"It really made a difference when we were meeting difficulty .\"says Dave. But the Fusses weren't the only folks in Alto and the neighboring town of Lowell to receive unexpected legacy from the Hatches. Dozens of other families were touched by what the Hatches had done. In some cases, it was a few thousand dollars; in others, it was more than $100,000. It surprised nearly everyone that the Hatches had so much money, more than $3 million--they were an elderly couple who lived in an old house on what was left of the family farm. Children of the Great Depression, Ish and Arlene were known for their habit of saving. They preferred comparison shopping and would go from store to store, checking prices before making a new purchase. Through the years, the Hatches paid for local children to attend summer camps when their parents couldn't afford it. \"Ish and Arlene never asked if you needed anything,\" says their friend Sandy Van Weelden, \"They could see things they could do to make you happier, and they would do them.\" Even more extraordinary was that the Hatches gave away their farmland.

They found the answer in the chemical structure of plastic itself. The research team found a way to make plastic that contains very small balloons filled with monomer  liquid.  When the new plastic cracks, the monomer liquid is let out and flows into the crack. Thus the break is repaired. The repaired plastic has seventy-five percent of the strength of undamaged plastic. The new self-repairing plastic is not yet ready for production. But it has several possible uses. One could be in space vehicles where parts cannot be repaired or replaced.

In Japan, people use  _ in their directions instead of street names. For example, the Japanese will say to travelers, \"Go straight down to the corner. Turn left at the big hotel and go past a fruit market. The post office is across from the bus stop.\"      In the countryside of the American Midwest, usually there are not many landmarks. There are no mountains, so the land is very flat . In many places there are no towns or buildings within miles. Instead of landmarks, people will tell you directions and distance. In Kansas or Iowa, for example, people will say, \"Go north two miles. Turn east, and then go another mile.\" People in Los Angeles, California, have no idea of distance on the map: They measure distance by means of time, not miles. \"How far away is the post office?\" you ask. \"Oh,\" they answer, \"It's about five minutes from here.\" You say, \"Yes, but how many miles away is it?\" They don't know.      People in Greece sometimes do not even try to give directions because visitors seldom understand the Greek language. Instead of giving you the direction, a Greek will often say, \"Follow me.\" Then he'll lead you through the streets of the city to the post office.       Sometimes a person doesn't know the answer to your question. What happens in this situation? A New Yorker might say, \"Sorry, I have no idea.\" But in Yucatan, Mexico, no one answers, \"I don't know.\" People in Yucatan think that \"I don't know\" is impolite. They usually give an answer, often a wrong one. A visitor can get very, very lost in Yucatan! One thing will help you everywhere -- in Japan, in the United States, in Greece, in Mexico, or in any other place. You might not understand a person's words, but maybe you can understand his body language. He or she will usually turn and then point in the correct direction. Go in that direction, and you may find the post office! In the passage,   _   countries are mentioned by the writer.",

        "question": "Liah Kaminer remembers hearing the shock from the audience when two seniors rapped the words \"raise your hand like a Nazi\" at a school assembly during her sophomore year. It wasn't the only instance of anti-Semitism   that Kaminer, 17, of Hall High School in Connecticut, says she witnessed at her school. There were other comments, like a boy asking two other students in her class if they were Jewish. When they replied that they weren't, he said, \"Oh, good.\" Kaminer recalled. He patted them on their backs and said, \"You're one of us.\" Kaminer, who is Jewish, said she was hurt by the remark, and after a while she got tired of seeing such comments swept under the rug . So she decided to take action. After reaching out to the administration and connecting with social studies department supervisor Stephen Armstrong, Kaminer and Armstrong put together a class on anti-Semitism. They presented it to every ninth-grade social studies class during the last week of school this year. In the class, Kaminer and Armstrong showed a clip from the ABC show, What Would You Do? where actors portrayed a Jewish couple and a bakery employee who yelled at them with anti-Semitic comments. They had class discussions about what stereotypes  students had heard. \"I was a little surprised and confused by how much of this still goes on at Hall.\" Armstrong said. \"That's why we're doing this. Although students are taught about the Holocaust   in history classes, it's a pity that kids are seldom asked to think about this topic in a present-day situation.\" \"The fact that a teenager was teaching her fellow students made the class more effective.\" Armstrong said. \"I could have done it - a couple of classes I did it myself - but it was a lot more effective when a kid was with me. It wasn't just some teacher talking. It was a kid who had experienced some of the stuff very personally.\" Which of the following could be the best title for the article?",

More and more teenagers are hanging out there. My pre-teen has already done so after school once a month, but she always orders fruit juice. I think she would drink coffee sooner or later, so I started doing some research online. I found that coffee in moderation   could be safe, but one thing that was constant online was the chance of becoming addicted to coffee. Coffee is one step up from soda but still not as dangerous as energy drinks or alcohol. Still, any addiction is hard to break, so I needed to come up with a plan that would protect my child. Coffee shops offer a safe place for teenagers to hang out. As like anything else you let your children do, you need to set limits. Drinking coffee while socializing once or twice a week won't cause a severe caffeine addiction. However, you should avoid allowing a cup of coffee every morning and ensure they get adequate sleep each night, which will make them less likely to feel the need to drink coffee. As parents, we have responsibility to set a good example. If you're addicted to caffeine, it's time to start monitoring your intake. If you drink much water and keep healthier drink options in your fridge and at your dinner table, your teenager will follow you. I drink much water and so do both my children. _  As a mother, I'm ready to allow my child to try coffee and we'll talk about it and discuss the pros and cons of consuming this. I feel open communication is vital in helping them make good decisions. Although the decision to drink coffee doesn't pose the same dangers as underage drinking, it still deserves a thoughtful conversation.

        "question": "It's such a shame to lose a free throw. Playing in the court has pressure from the opponent, time, your teammates, the audience, and yourself. You have to shoot the ball despite all the pressures around. But with a free throw, you have the ball, no one will try to get it from you, and you have all the time to shoot the ball. But why is it that many players, even good shooters, miss most of their free throws? Maybe they need more practice or maybe they need to apply more ways to improve their free throw. Improve your player or your free throwing skills by following the tips below: Make it personal. The truth is, there is no rule on how one should handle and throw the ball in a free throw. What matters is that the player should shoot the ball from the free throw line no matter how he does it. So when trying to improve your free throw shooting, better stick to what works the best for you. Do not copy other people's techniques. Make it your own and leave those techniques as theirs. Formulate   a repetitive way of shooting the ball. A free throw should be personalized. But it should also be repetitive. You should be able to repeat your free throw techniques whether you are in your court or in another court, whether you are energized or tired. You can't say you have a personal free throw technique if you can't repeat it over and over again. Shoot at the same position and distance for every free throw. Basketball courts may be located in different places or maybe marked with different paint colors. But all of these courts maintain the same distance from the _ to the free throw line. Familiarize your perfect position when making your free throws. That should help you do your perfect throw. Which of the following might serve as the best title of the above passage?",

It also provides children with a reading model. Reading aloud doesn't just benefit young children. Parents should continue reading aloud as their children grow because listening comprehension is more important than reading skills in middle school. Jim Trelease, in his Read-Aloud Handbook, has noted that almost as big a mistake as not reading to children at all is stopping too soon  Until about the eighth grade, children listen and comprehend on a higher level than their reading skills allow them to read independently, This means children can hear and understand stories that are more difficult and more interesting than anything they can read on their own If you want to join the activity, you're supposed to   _",

        "question": "The Internet can be a great way to connect with people. The latest web craze is social networking on websites such as MySpace. More than 65 million young people use online social networking sites. That cyberspace  trend is causing problems in school, however. In a recent survey, nearly 36 percent of school administrators said that social networking sites troubled learning in their districts. Should school districts ban sites like MySpace? Teachers are worried that some students use social networking to post personal information and to cyber bully  other students. One of the biggest dangers comes from people who find out kid's personal information. Many districts have blocked students from accessing or using social networking sites from school computers, and some have suspended  students for posting harmful material on those sites from their home computers. Nearly two-thirds of US kids have computers in their homes, according to the US Census Bureau. \"It is important to keep in mind that just blocking access to social web sites at school is not the end of the story,\" warns NSBA executive director Anne Bryant, \"Most of the misuse of these sites takes place at home but still affects the classroom.\"  _ . They say the main problem with sites like MySpace is that students don't understand the dangers involved in using them. \"Many students are posting personal information about themselves without regard to who has access to that information,\" Jim Hirsch said, \"Schools should focus on educating their students and their parents on how to be safe online.\" Experts argue that too many schools are forbidding students to use social networking web sites without thinking about their educational benefits. \"Social networking web sites can help connect students in the United States to their peers in other countries, providing invaluable lessons in foreign cultures,\" explains Hirsch.

Since then, Barbie doll, as everyone called her, has become the most famous toy doll in history. Her parent, the Mattel Company, said that 90% of all American girls between 3 and 10 have at least one Barbie at home. However, Barbie is facing some trouble at present, There are many similar   dolls on the market in competition with her. Another doll named Bratz, for example, came to life fifteen years ago. She looks more like today's pop stars with heavy makeup   and miniskirts. It seems that Barbie has lost her magic   among older girls. \"For young girls, playing with a Barbie is much fun. But when you get older, you want something smarter and more modern,\" Says Vera Shepherd, a shopkeeper in a New York toy shop. It is good news that on the international market Barbie is still No. 1. Although Mattel is selling fewer Barbies in the United States these years, sales in other countries are still going up. In January 2009, Mattel opened its first Barbie store in Shanghai, where girls can shop, eat, drink or even become _ for their own Barbies. Mattel is planning big celebrations for Barbie's 55th birthday. Fashion designers from all over the world will make new dresses for Barbie.

She was like a god to him he had no idea where she came from or how she worked her magic. The baby eagle was hungry all the time, but the mother eagle would always come just in time with the food.

Surprisingly, these three things do not always go together in the job world . According to a general social survey by the National Organization for Research at the University of Chicago in the US, the ten happiest jobs are not those with better pay or higher social position. They are ordinary jobs. But what is it that makes a \"happy\" job? Researchers found that people are happier when they feel they are doing something worthwhile. Six of the top ten happiest jobs are based heavily on helping others, such as firefighters, teachers, and physical therapists( ). Being able to express oneself is also important for people to feel satisfied . Take authors as an example. Their pay is \"ridiculously low or non-existent\", but \"the freedom of writing down the contents of your own mind leads to happiness ,\"wrote business author Steve Denning on his blog on Forbes.com. These jobs are greatly different to the top ten \"hated jobs\", according a website survey earlier this year. Director of information technology, sales manager, technical specialist and others that are generally considered respectable jobs are on the list. Todd May from The New York Times didn't find the results strange. He argued that \" a meaningful life must, in some sense then , make people feel worthwhile\". If a person doesn't participate in the causes \" that are generally regarded as worthy, like feeding and clothing the poor, their life will lack meaning ,\"he said . Work takes up the greater part of most people's  lives . It's no wonder that the people with the most worthwhile jobs are the happiest of all. However, it's important to remember that these two surveys are broad ones and that it doesn't matter whether your dream job is on the two lists. Now it is the time to think about the future .

        "question": "Some people seem easy to understand: their character appears obvious on first meeting. Appearances, however, can be deceptive. I shrug my shoulders when people tell me that their first impressions of a person are always right. For my own part I find that the longer I know people, the more they puzzle me. I read in this morning's paper that Edward Hyde Burton had died. He was a businessman and he had been in business in Japan for many years. Once he gave me a great surprise. Unless I had heard the story from his own lips, I'd never have believed that he was capable of such an action. He was always neatly and quietly dressed in accordance with his age and position. He didn't talk much, but what he said was sensible. You couldn't imagine he'd possibly raise his voice in anger. Here was a man who attracted you because you felt in him a real love for his fellows. He'd tell with point a good and spicy story, and in his youth he'd been something of an athlete. He was a rich man and he'd made every penny himself. I suppose one thing that made you like him was that he was so weak; he aroused your instincts  of protection. You felt he couldn't bear to hurt a fly.               One afternoon Burton told me a \"funny\" story in a quiet, dry humour:               \"There was a namesake  of mine, who was the best bridge player I ever met. He  seemed to have a fantastic instinct about the cards. He won a good deal of my money by card-playing.\" \"One day he came to me when he lost all his fortune. He came to see me in my office and asked me for a job. I asked him how old he was.\" \" 'Thirty-five', he said.\"               \" 'And what have you been doing ever since ?' I asked him.\"               \" 'Well, nothing very much.' he said.\"               \" 'I'm afraid I can't do anything for you just yet' I said. 'Come back and see me in another thirty-five years, and I'll see what I can do.' \" \"He didn't move. He went rather pale. He hesitated for a moment and then he told me that he had had bad luck at cards for some time. He lost everything he had. He hadn't a penny. He was down and out. If he couldn't get something to do he'd not survive.\"  \"I looked at him for a bit. I could see now that he was all to pieces. He'd been drinking more than usual and he looked fifty.\"  \"Suddenly I had an idea.\" Pausing in his story, Burton turned to me. \"When I was young I swam over three miles round the beacon  and landed at the river of Tarumi. It's rather difficult on account of the currents round the beacon. Well, I told my young fellow about it and I said that if he'd do it I'd give him a job.\" \"I could see he was rather surprised. He was not in good condition for sports. He looked at me for a moment and then he nodded.\" \"I told him I'd drive round to the river at half past twelve and meet him.\"               \" 'Done,' he said.\" \"I wished him good luck and he left me. I had a lot of work to do that morning and I only just managed to get to the river Tarumi at half past twelve. But I needn't have hurried; he never turned up.\"               \"Did he fear it at the last moment?\" I asked. \"No, he didn't fear it. He started all right. But of course he'd ruined his constitution  by drink. The currents round the beacon were more than he could manage. We didn't get the body for about three days.\" I didn't say anything for a moment or two. I was rather shocked. Then I asked.               \"When you made him that offer of a job, did you know he'd be drowned?\"               He looked at me with his kind blue eyes, smiling. \"Well, I hadn't got a position in my office at the moment.\" Edward Burton could be described as a(n)     person.",

It has taken on a popular event born in Japan but sweeping Asia known as White Day on March 14 when men return the favor with gifts for women. But Black Day, on April 14, is a South Korean original. It is marked by people who have not found love dressing in dark color1s and commiserating    over meals of black food, with the dish of choice being Chinese-style noodles topped with a thick sauce of black bean paste.   \"I had a miserable time on Valentine ' s Day, felt even lonelier on White Day and now I' m crying over a bowl of' black noodles,\" said a young woman, \"Things better be different next year.

Some days have gained attraction such as Black Day, while others such as Green Day in August, when couples are supposed to drink cheap wine that comes in green bottles and walk in the woods, have yet to attract much of a following. Black Day events have snowballed, with a major matchmaking service this year providing an evening of speed dating where the dish of choice is sushi blackened by squid ink.

In the cold and the darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, wandered through the streets. It is true she had on a pair of slippers when she left home, but they were not of much use. They were very large, so large, indeed, that they had belonged to her mother, and the poor girl had lost them in running across the street to avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate. One of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other and ran away with it. So the little girl went on with her little naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In an old apron she carried a number of matches, and had a bunch of them in her hands. No one had bought anything of her the whole day, nor had any one given her even a penny. Lights were shining from every window, and there was a delicious smell of roast goose, for it was New-year's eve--yes, she remembered that. In a corner, between two houses, one of which projected beyond the other, she sank down and huddled herself together. She had drawn her little feet under her, but she could not keep off the cold; and she dared not go home, for she had sold no matches, and could not take home even a penny of money. Her father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at home as here. How did the little girl feel in the passage?",

        "question": "Let's face it -- you're going to get a lot of well-intentioned advice from friends, parents and grandparents about your sleep. Some of this advice is going to be just wrong. Myth 1: Sleeping late on the weekends will make up for lost sleep during the week. Fact: Getting less than the amount of sleep that you need night after night accumulates over time and starts to create a \"sleep debt\". And like all debts, eventually you need to pay the price. The problem with waiting until the weekend to meet sleep needs is that in the meantime, you are paying the price of being less alert, feeling more moody, thinking slower and having less stimulation. Myth 2: A boring teacher (or warm room, full stomach, etc.) can put teens to sleep. Fact: If you are getting enough sleep on a regular basis, there is no teacher, math book or reading assignment in the world boring enough to make you fall asleep in class. There are basically two things that make people sleepy -- not getting enough sleep and not getting good quality sleep. The environment kids are in, including the room temperature, light level and entertainment value, may unmask underlying sleepiness, but the environment does not cause it! So if you are dozing off in class, don't blame it on bad teaching.  Myth 3: Teenagers can pull an all-nighter to study and still be ready for the big test in the morning. Fact: Teenagers are much better off studying less and getting a good night's sleep. Research clearly shows that the ability to concentrate and learn new information, as well as to work efficiently, declines sharply after being awake for 15-16 hours, and continues to bottom out the longer you stay up. Plus, if the big test is at 8:00 am, the problem gets even worse. That's because morning time typically represents a low energy point in the body's normal 24-hour circadian  rhythm, especially in teenagers. According to the passage, at 8:00 am a teenager will   _  .",

As well as the popular image of Canada as a country of forests, there are also deserts and badlands , rain forests and long and wide beaches. Canada has huge inland lakes, evergreen forests, woodlands and meadows. Canada's coastlines are thousands of miles long, with long, wild rivers leading to the oceans. In contrast  to the expanses of open country, Canada also has its share of urban areas. The majority of the population and heavy industry is in the two provinces of Quebec and Ontario, but large and modern cities are spread across the land from the Atlantic to the Pacific, all within a few hours drive, at most, from the border with the United States. Business is active throughout the country, The Prairie Provinces with their vast fields of grain help to feed the world. The fisheries on both the West and the East Coast are widespread. Oil and natural gas have recently been discovered off the East Coast. The Trans-Canada Highway links the country from coast to coast, there is an extensive  network of railways, and a widespread network of airline routes serving both major and remote  communities. The rural areas are less populated, with more and more people leaving for the larger towns and cities. The lands to the north are much less developed, but as some of these areas are used for their plenty of natural resources, populations are growing.

We heard the tiger a second before we saw it. It jumped out like a flash of lightning, five hundred kilos plus and four metres long. I looked into its eyes and face, and saw right down the animal's throat. It grabbed Kamal's leg between its teeth, but I managed to pull Kamal away.

Although you can't drive it on the roads, it is small and easy to fly and can take off and land like a helicopter  . Urban Aeronautics' X-Hawk is another type of sky car.

        "question": "(CNN)-China will sometimes say \"no\" and the world should get used to it. That message came through when China joined Russia in blocking action on Syria. \"Do not mistakenly think that because China takes a careful and responsible position on the Syria issue, China will not use its veto power   or will always abstain ,\" said Cui Tiankai, China's vice foreign minister, \"When China must use its veto power to say no, it will surely use it.\" On Saturday, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the vetoes \"disgusting and shameful.\" He Wenping, director of African Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the veto shows China's confidence in foreign affairs. \"A country expressing its true opinion - that's progress. China opposes the use of threat or force to achieve regime change in other countries. This agrees with China's long-standing diplomacy principle. It is also not acceptable for China to rush a U.N. vote without sufficient discussion.\" So why did China use its veto this time? China's critics say China's veto of the U.N. draft proposal  was in part due to Beijing's fear that allowing a regime change in Syria could encourage the spread of the Arab revolution and eventually threaten China. He Wenping disagrees, \"China has a completely different political system and economic development path. If someone in the international community thinks that the Arab Spring will happen in China, then I think they misjudge the situation in China, exaggerate  some problems in the Chinese society and underestimate the ability of the Chinese government to control the situation in China.\" What can we learn from the passage?",

He had been to Paris, where he learned to love the taste of tomatoes. He grew many kinds of tomatoes in his garden. The President taught his cook a way for a cream of tomato soup.

The number of disabled people in India alone is probably more than double the total population of Canada.      In the United Kingdom, about one in ten people have some disability. Disability is not just something that happens to other people: as we get older, many of us will become less mobile, hard of hearing or have failing eyesight.      Disablement can take many forms and occur at any time of life. Some people are born with disabilities. Many others become disabled as they get older. There are many progressive disabling diseases. The longer time goes on, the worse they become. Some people are disabled in accidents. Many others may have a period of disability in the form of a mental illness. All are affected by people's attitude towards them.      Disabled people face many physical barriers. Next time you go shopping or to work or visit friends, imagine how you would manage if you could not get up steps, or on to buses and trains. How would you cope if you could not see where you were going or could not hear the traffic? But there are other barriers: prejudice can be even harder to break down and ignorance inevitably represents by far the greatest barrier of all. It is almost impossible for the able-bodied to fully appreciate what the severely disabled go through, so it is important to draw attention to these barriers and show that it is the individual person and their ability, not their disability, which counts.

        "question": "Beauty has always been regarded as something praiseworthy. Almost everyone thinks attractive people are happier and healthier,have better marriages and have more respectable occupations. Personal consultants give them better advice for finding jobs. Even judges are softer on attractive defendants .But in the executive circle,beauty can become a _ . While attractiveness is a positive factor for a man on his way up the executive ladder,it is harmful to a woman. Handsome male executives were thought as having more integrity than plainer men;effort and ability were thought to account for their success. Attractive female executives were considered to have less integrity than unattractive ones;their success was attributed not to ability but to factors such as luck. All unattractive women executives were thought to have more integrity and to be more capable than the attractive female executives. Interestingly,though,the rise of the unattractive overnight successes was attributed more to personal relationships and less to ability than that of attractive overnight successes. Why are attractive women not thought to be able?An attractive woman is thought to be more feminine and an attractive man more masculine than the less attractive ones. Thus,an attractive woman has an advantage in traditionally female jobs,but an attractive woman in a traditionally masculine position appears to lack the \"masculine\" qualities required. This is true even in politics. \"When the only clue is how he or she looks,people treat men and women differently,\"says Anne Bowman,who recently published a study on the effects of attractiveness on political candidates. She asked 125 undergraduate students to rank two groups of photographs,one of men and one of women,in order of attractiveness. The students were told the photographs were of candidates for political offices. They were asked to rank them again,in the order they would vote for them. The results showed that attractive males utterly defeated unattractive men,but the women who had been ranked most attractive invariably received the fewest votes.

I was a bit surprised when I googled \"Singles Day\" on the Internet, to find that China is the only country in the world that has set aside a special day for singles to celebrate their lives. To find out more about this celebration, please read on. An old story goes that once there were four single men, leading very boring lives. None of them were married, or had lovers, or did anything exciting. They just sat around all day and played Mahjong. One day they played Mahjong from 11 in the morning until 11 at night. During the game, no matter who won, the winning card was always the \"four columns\" card (the card shows four independent, parallel columns in two lines). Even more of a coincidence, it was Nov 11, or 11/11. In order to commemorate the day, they nicknamed it Singles Day. Singles Day was first celebrated at various universities in Nanjing, capital city of Jiangsu Province during the 1990s. It got the name Singles Day because the date consists of four \"ones\". These college students have since graduated, and carried their university tradition into society. Singles Day is now a special day for all fashionable youths. The main way to celebrate Singles Day is to have dinner with your single friends, but it's important that each person pay their own fee to show their independence. People also hold \"blind date\" parties in an attempt to say goodbye to their single lives. Many singles also choose to say goodbye to their single lives on this day. Many attend \"blind date\" parties and many people choose to marry on this day. In addition to meaning \"single\" the four \"ones\" of the date can also mean \"only one\" as in \"the only one for me.\" Some people will use this date and this meaning to tell their special someone that they are the only \"one\" in their heart.

        "question": "The Internet has revolutionized our lives to such an extent that for most people, the global network has become more than just a tool but rather an indispensable aid in everyday life. More and more people go online as wireless networks have brought the Internet closer and closer: it's on our mobile phones, in our cars and TV sets, in hospital surgery rooms and in fishing boats that battle the waves of the Atlantic. And this revolution has brought along with it a new way of shopping. Both big and small, e-commerce websites have literally flooded the Internet by the hundreds of thousands. Anything you can buy from a brick and mortar store  you can also buy online: from food and clothes to guns and bombs, no matter what you're looking for, you're bound to find the right online store with just a few clicks of the mouse. This revolution has sent cold trembles down the backbones of brick and mortar business owners. And what was their reaction? They've opened online stores to go hand in hand with their conventional businesses. Nowadays, every \"Mom and Pop's\" cheesecake store also has a website. In a recent survey, 68% of small business owners have stated that they are scared of being put out of business by the powerful flood that e-commerce has become. So it's no wonder many of them have decided to join the revolution and establish some kind of an online presence even though most of them have stated that they dislike the Internet. But do the big players have reasons to be afraid? Are we going to start seeing ghostly, deserted Wal-Marts across the country? Probably not in the near future but the day will come when most people will just stop shopping offline anymore. A trip to Wal-Marts wastes time, burns gas and sometimes adds a few extra dots on the stress counter. The recent advancements in mobile technology and the introduction of mobile phones with improved web capabilities has even made some people order their groceries when they get out from work and have them delivered at their doorstep by the time they get home. And as \"Time is money\", this practice is lifesaving for people who work two jobs. Technology will continue to advance and e-commerce will follow closely in its footsteps. Everything will become easier and less time consuming, leaving us more time to enjoy the things that really matter in life: the ones we love, our friends and hobbies.

If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire   to find a way out of trouble.

        "question": "Anna was excited about starting her first day in the new school. However, when she first walked past the students in the school, her excitement turned to fear, and then to loneliness over the next few days. \"Why didn't anyone say 'hi' to me or invite me to his or her lunch table? Is it because of my clothes or my hair?\" she wondered. Almost every day during the first week, Anna stayed alone, thinking that there must have been something wrong with her or that nobody saw her at all! What caused Anna's problem? The reason was that nobody knew her. Most people don't like talking with strangers  . So it's your job to volunteer to make contact with people who you want to know. The easiest way to catch their attention is to notice them first. Make eye contact with them and smile at them. When you smile at them, you are doing your best to show your kindness to them, and they are sure to understand that you are saying, \"Hey, how's everything going?\" In this way, you are taking the first step towards the road to friendship. When Anna realized this, she started talking to her classmates. Guess what happened? It really worked. She had made two friends by the end of the month. In fact, saying \"hi\" or making friends with strangers is not hard. And the joy it brings you is really great. So try to open your heart to strangers! What was Anna's problem?",

        "question": "German academics believe they have solved the centuries-old mystery of the \"Mona Lisa\" in Leonardo ad Vinci's famous portrait  . Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant, Francesco del Giocondo, has long been seen as the most likely model for the sixteenth-century painting. Art historians have wondered whether the smiling woman may actually have been da Vinci's lover or mother, or the artist himself. Now experts at the prefix = st1 /HeidelbergUniversitylibrary say old notes made in a book by its owner in October, 1503, confirm that Lisa del Giocondo was indeed the model for the famous portrait in the world. \"All doubts about the identity of the Mona Lisa have been removed by a discovery by Dr. Armin Schlechter,\" the library said in a statement on Monday. \"Until then, only 'scant   evidence' from sixteenth-century documents had been available. These had left lots of room for doubt, and many different identities were put forward.\" The comments compare Leonardo to the ancient Greek artist Apelles, and say he was working on three paintings at that time, one of which was a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. Art experts say the Heidelbergdiscovery is a break-through, and the earliest mention linking the merchant's wife to the portrait. Before this discovery the earliest link dated from around 1550, and was made by Italian official Giorgio Vasari, the library said, adding that there had been doubts about Vasari's reliability. The Heidelbergnotes were actually discovered over two year's ago in the library by Schlechter, a spokeswoman said. Although the findings were published in the library's catalogue, they were not widely publicized, and received little attention until a German broadcaster decided to do some recording there, she said.

While unwilling at first to swim in cold water or get her face wet, she began to train in earnest   as her talent became clear.

I had got into the habit of sitting in the last carriage at the platform, so I could get off near to the station exit at my end. One evening before getting off the train, I found a purse. I opened the purse and thought this must be my lucky day, for the purse contained some PS80 in cash. Looking further into the purse, I found credit cards, and house keys and a name and address. My first thought when seeing the cash was to pocket it, and throw the other contents away. Now I am not a basically dishonest person, but had developed a hardened attitude over the years that most people were dishonest in some way, and my own personal experience had been that whenever I lost anything of value, that was the last I ever saw of it. And since I was a construction worker at that time, I had been the victim of a great deal of stealing during my working life. Almost as I read the name and address, I had a picture of that woman being struck with terror, when she realized she had lost her purse, and could not get into her home, had no money, and, would have thoughts of someone spending on her credit cards, not to mention the trouble of canceling all the cards. In that same moment I decided to hand the purse over  to the train guard. So I told him I would like to see it returned to its rightful owner. He told me would be sent to the lost property office. I arrived at my station and started to walk the five minute journey to my home all the while feeling very pleased with myself that I was going to bring a great deal of happiness to someone I did not know.

The root of the unhappiness isn't that we want things to be different, however, it's that we decided we didn't like it in the first place.We've judged it as bad, rather than saying, \"It's not bad or good, but it just is.\" Here is an example.I have written a paper, A Beautiful Method to Find Peace of Mind.Quite a few people think it bad after reading it because I think people should expect things to go differently than you planned, and that you should accept that, instead of encouraging people to change themselves or the environment as much as possible.You could accept it as the way the world works-as the way things actually are.And try to understand why that is, and follow it, as it is. This can be useful to whatever you do: whether it be how other people act at work, how politics works and how depressing the news media can be.Accept these things as they are, and try to understand why they're that way. It'll save you a lot of sadness because you'll no longer say, \"Oh, I wish things didn't go bad!\" If you really understand what I mean, you can try a different way to live in this world:accept, and understand.It might lead to some interesting results.

        "question": "The Cuban iguana is a species of lizard  of the iguana family. It is the largest of the West Indian rock iguanas, one of the most endangered groups of lizards. This species with red eyes and a thick tail is one of the largest lizards in the Caribbean. The Cuban iguana is primarily _ ; 95% of its diet consists of the leaves, flowers and fruits from as many as 30 plant species, including the seaside rock bush and various grasses. However, Cuban iguanas occasionally consume animal matter, and individuals have been observed eating the dead flesh of birds, fish and crabs, The researchers wrote that quite a few people on Isla Magueyes could have caused this incident. The Cuban iguana is distributed throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islands with a wild population booming on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. It is also found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, where a separate subspecies occurs. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites half destroyed by Cuban crocodiles. To avoid the attack from them, the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti  . In general the species is in decline, more quickly on the mainland than on the outlying islands. One of the reasons for their decline is habitat destruction caused by the over consuming of farm animals, housing development, and the building of tourist resorts on the beaches where the animals prefer to build their nests. Although the wild population is in decline, the numbers of iguanas have been sharply increased as a result of captive-breeding  and other conservation programs. .What's the author's purpose of writing the text?",

        "question": "Staying married has its benefits. A new U.S.-wide study shows the wealth of a married person is almost double that of somebody who is single. \"If you really want to increase your wealth, get married and stay married. On the other hand, divorce can destroy your wealth,\" said Jay Zagorsky, author of the study. Married people will see an increase in wealth that is more than just adding the assets of two single people, ac-cording to the study published in the Journal of Sociology. Those who remained together saw a 93 percent gain in wealth compared to that of a single person, while individuals facing divorce saw their financial situation worsen long before they finally divorced, according to Zagorsky. The study used data from surveys taken over a 15-year period involving 9,055 Americans who were between 21 and 28 years old in 1985. Those who remained single had a steady, but slow growth in wealth, from less than $2,000 at the start of the surveys up to an average of about $11,000 after 15 years. However, those who married and stayed that way showed a sharp increase in wealth after marriage, growing to an average $43,000 by the 10th year of marriage or by about 16 percent a year. For people who married and then divorced, there was a slow build-up of wealth during the early years of marriage and then a steady decrease about four years before divorce. The study also showed doubt about a common idea that divorce was much harder financially on women than on men. In fact, it showed that women suffered financially only slightly more than men.

        "question": "A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics   have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress.

        "question": "Given the tradition of students bringing apples to their teachers, it somehow seems fitting that an old apple barn  will find a new life as a one-room schoolhouse. And it is just as fitting that a retired schoolteacher will become the caretaker of that historic treasure. My friend Velma, a teacher for more than 30 years, has been retired for some time now, but that doesn't stop her giving history lessons at the old Englewood School, located on her family's California farm. The lovingly restored building was constructed around 1850 as a home for a woodsman and later was used as apple barn. Then, in 1870 it began a new life as a schoolhouse. Originally located in the nearby Englewood meadow, it was now moved its current site in 1978 by Velma's late husband and his brother, Robert and Richard, who thought it would help keep Velma busy in retirement. No nails had been used in the original construction, so each piece of wood had to be carefully marked and the building was reassembled on its new site. The brothers worked with much care and hard work to ensure a perfect fit of mitered corners. After the relocation, Velma and her family furnished the school with some of its original desks. They also added a collection of schoolbooks, the oldest dating back to 1845. Perhaps the school's most cherished souvenir is the diploma of student Hettie Essig, who graduated on June 30, 1904. Hettie's daughter, Flora, presented Velma with _ . Nowadays Velma gives tours to local schoolchildren and other groups, who learn what it was like to attend school back in the good old days. She has kids ring the school bell, recite the Pledge of Allegiance and sing \"Good Morning to You\" as they might have done in days gone by. Then, with twinkling eyes and much enthusiasm, she tells the history of the school, and gives a short sample lesson. Which word can best describe the school's being relocated?",

        "question": "According to a recent survey, Canadian parents realize their role as protectors and providers to raise their children both emotionally and physically. That's not very different from the way our parents saw themselves. But with more two-career families and busy schedules, one thing parents today recognize more than ever is the need to set aside special time for their children. These 'nurturing moments' are changed into memories that they will treasure all their lives. Nurturing moments might be the time between our work and life,bringing your child to work with you to see what you do during the day,visiting your child's make-believe world,discussing his other school day and exploring the natural world outside your door. These times are not merely a luxury  , they're a necessity. It's during these moments that parents pass values and attitudes to their children. Over time, children pick up good habits and positive self-image. Here are a few tips for making the most of your family time together: Regularly sit down as a family to share a meal. Allow each person to describe something interesting about his or her day. Make one night a week family night. Family members take turns choosing a special activity for the evening everyone partakes in the fun. Show your children you care about their interests by having them teach you about their activity or hobby. Nurturing healthy children involves body, mind and spirit. The little things you do to your care are the building blocks for confidence, self-esteem and a healthy outlook. By giving your children these tools, you prepare them for life.

Although they lived mostly with their mother, they spent a lot of time with us. Over the years, we all learned to become more comfortable with each other. However, I continued to feel somewhat like an outsider.  When the children moved to a town five hours away, my husband was understandably destroyed. In order to keep in touch with the kids, we set up an e-mail and chat-line service. Ironically  , this technology can make us feel out of touch and more in need of real human contact. If a computer message came addressed to \"Dad\", I'd feel forgotten. If my name appeared along with his, it would brighten my day.  _ not just over the telephone wires. Late one evening, as my husband was snoozing  , I was catching up on my e-mail, an \"instant message\" appeared on the screen. It was Margo, my oldest stepdaughter, also up late in front of her computer. We sent several messages back and forth, exchanging the latest news. When we \"chatted\" like that, she wouldn't necessarily know if it was me or her dad unless she asked. That night she didn't ask and I didn't tell her it was me either. After hearing the latest volleyball scores and the details about a coming dance at her school, I said that it was late and I should go to sleep. Her return message read, \"Okay, talk to you later! Love you!\" At this, a wave of sadness ran through me and I realized that she must have thought she was writing to her father the whole time. She and I would never have openly exchange such words of love. Feeling guilty   for not telling her the truth, yet not wanting to embarrass   her, I simply replied, \"Love you too! Have a good sleep!\" I thought again of their family circle and I felt again the sharp ache of emptiness and \"otherness\". Then, just as my fingers reached for the keys to return the screen to black, Margo's final message appeared.

Tell your teacher or parents about any problem that is preventing you from paying attention. Take good notes Write down facts that your teacher mentions or writes on the board. Try to use good handwriting so you can read your notes later. It's a good idea to keep your notes organized by subject. Plan ahead for tests and projects Waiting until Thursday night to study for Friday's test will make it hard to do your best. One of the best ways to make sure that doesn't happen is to plan ahead. Write down your test dates. You can then plan how much to do after school each day, and how much time to spend on each topic. Break it up When there's a lot to study, it can help to break things into several parts. Let's say you have a spelling test on 20 words. Instead of thinking about all of the words at once, try breaking them down into five-word groups and work on one or two different groups each night. Ask for help You can't study effectively if you don't understand the material. Be sure to ask your teacher for help. If you're at home when the confusion occurs, your morn or dad might be able to help. Sleep tight So the test is tomorrow and you've followed your study plan--but suddenly you can't remember anything!

It produces a poison that causes a painless , watery diarrhea( )  that can quickly lead to severe dehydration  and death if treatment is not given. Most persons infected with cholera do not become ill, although the bacterium is present in their waste for 7-14 days. When this illness does strike, more than 90% of the time is not severe and is difficult to tell from other types of diarrhea. Less than 10% of sick persons develop cholera with signs of moderate or severe dehydration. A person may get cholera by drinking water or eating food polluted with the cholera bacterium. The disease can spread rapidly in areas without the proper treatment of drinking water. The cholera bacterium may also live in the environment in dirty rivers and coastal waters. Shellfish eaten raw have been a source of cholera. Therefore, the disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another. Cholera can be simply and successfully treated by immediate replacement of the fluid and salts lost through diarrhea. Patients can be treated by being given a mixture of sugar and salt to be mixed with water and drunk in large amount. Antibiotics  shorten the course and decrease the severity of the illness.

He sent his camera crew  out one evening to film the sunset for him. The next morning he said to the men, \"Have you provided me with that sunset?\" \"No, sir,\" the men answered.

We can get you a sunrise over the sea, if necessary, but not a sunset.\" \"But I want a sunset!\" the director shouted. \"Go to the airport, take the next flight to the west coast, and get one.\" But then a young secretary had an idea. \"Why don't you photograph a sunrise,\" she suggested, \"and then play it backwards? Then it'll look like a sunset.\" \"That's a very good idea!\" the director said. Then he turned to the camera crew and said, \"Tomorrow morning I want you to get me a beautiful sunrise over the sea.\" The camera crew went out early the next morning and filmed a bright sunrise over the beach in the middle of a beautiful bay. Then at nine o'clock they took it to the director. \"Here it is, sir,\" they said, and gave it to him. He was very pleased.

        "question": "As we know, there are differences between western culture and Chinese culture. We can see differences when we pay attention to the way words are used. Let's look at the words about animals and plants. Most expressions in Chinese about the dog, for example, \"a homeless dog\", \"a mad dog\", \"a running dog\" and \"a dog catching a mouse\", have negative meanings. But in western countries, dogs are thought to be honest and good friends of humans. In English, people use the dog to describe positive actions. For example, \"you are a lucky dog\" means you are a lucky person. And \"every dog has its day\" means each person has good luck sometimes. To describe a person's serious illness, they say \"sick as a dog\". The word \"dog-tired\" means very tired. However, Chinese love cats very much. But in western culture, \"cat\" is often used to describe a woman who is cruel. There are many other examples of how \"cat\" is used differently as well. The rose is regarded as a symbol of love in both China and some western countries. People think the rose stands for love, peace, courage and friendship. And the rose is the national flower of England, America and many other countries. The words about plants and animals are used in positive or negative ways in different cultures. We can learn about many differences in cultures by comparing how some words are used. Which of the following is true according to the passage?",

As a little girl, Winfrey was always different. She learned to read when she was three. She read the Bible in church and was famous for being the little girl who talked a lot. Since then, talking has been the most important part of her life.    She got her first big chance while at Tennessee State University. At age 17, she was offered a job at a radio station. Next, she hosted a talk show, \" People Are Talking\" , which soon became very popular. People felt comfortable telling her about their lives, and people liked her warm interviewing style. After a year, the show was renamed \" The Oprah Winfrey Show\" , and she was a star.    Winfrey's real dream, though , was to be an actor.    Finally, she achieved this when she starred in \" The Color Purpose\" in 1985. Her performance won her an Oscar nomination . She now has her own production company.

        "question": "Shake Shack is a new kind of restaurant becoming more popular in the U.S. The restaurants are not\"fast food\" . They are known as\"fast casual\" . Observers say Americans want more choices and fresh food when choosing where and what to eat. This trend is one reason why the fast food restaurant McDonald' s has struggled financially. In the last quarter of 2014, McDonald' s net income dropped by about $300 million. The January earnings report brought more bad news. Worldwide sales dropped for the eighth month in a row and even more than expected. While McDonald' s is struggling to get their customers back, Shake Shack, is doing well in making money. The New York-based burger chain had a very successful IPO, or initial public offering, of shares at the end of January. On its first day of trading, Shake Shack went from $21 a share to just under $46 a share. Being part of the \"fast casual \"trend has helped Shake Shack. Other fast casual restaurants in the U.S. include Chipotle and Panera. Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant expert with NPD has studied Americans' restaurant habits for almost 30 years. She says one reason why Americans like fast casual food is that it' s new. It' s creative, it' s something different and people like to try new things. Her study shows Americans made 61 billion visits to restaurants last year. Three out of four visits were to fast food restaurants, like McDonald' s. Fast casual is still a small percentage of restaurant visits, but it has developed fast. Just as Ms. Riggs says,\"It' s growing _ because they meet consumers' needs. They know it' s being prepared while they wait, it' s fresh, quality food, good tasting food at what they say are reasonable and affordable prices.\" Many Americans still like their fast food.

        "question": "The first English dictionary was published in 1604. The dictionary was actually nothing more than a list of about 3, 000 difficult words, each followed by a one-word definition. The author, Robert Cawdrey, made no attempt to include everyday words in his dictionary. No one, he reasoned, would ever have to look up a word in a dictionary if he already knew the meaning of the word. During the 1600's more dictionaries were published. Each followed Cawdrey's lead and presented a few thousand hard words. Around 1700 one dictionary maker, John Kersey, did define easy words as well as hard words. But until the 1750's all the dictionaries were rather crude and not very valuable. A man named Dr Samuel Johnson changed all this. In 1755 Dr Johnson produced the first modern dictionary. He included in his dictionary all important words, both easy and hard, and he gave good meanings. He also gave good sentences to show how each word was actually used in speech and in writing. By the end of the 1700's most dictionary makers had followed Johnson's example. Dictionaries were getting better and better. The 1800's saw the greatest improvement in the quality of dictionaries. In England scholars planned and prepared the Oxford English Dictionary, a twenty-volume (;;) work. One of the most interesting features of the Oxford Dictionary is its word histories.

        "question": "Many kids turn up their noses at the thought of eating fish because, well, it can smell \"fishy\".  While it is usually a healthy source of protein in the diet, there may be several reasons to avoid biting into a forkful of fish. Before you break out the tartar sauce, learn some facts about fish to keep yourself and the environment healthy. Some fish may contain harmful chemicals, which can be the result of both natural causes and water pollution. Mercury is a poisonous chemical, which occurs naturally in oceans and the Earth's crust, but also comes from man-made sources, such as pesticides, burning garbage, and the releasing of fossil fuels. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of chemicals, can also be found in some fish. These dangerous man-made chemicals were used in many industries until 1977, when they were banned.  PCBs were released or leaked into the air and water and have been transported around the globe. How do mercury and PCBs end up in fish and the food supply? When they are released into the air, they attach themselves to particles. These particles settle on the ground and in the water and are eventually eaten by microscopic organisms. Small fish eat the micro-organisms, and large fish eat the small fish and on up the food chain. Because they can negatively affect your health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency advises that kids younger than 15 years old avoid fish that contain high levels of mercury and PCBs. These include shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. There are also many types of fish that are good for you, but because of overfishing are in danger of being wiped out. Some are being fished in the wild so much that they cannot reproduce fast enough to survive. Others are being farmed in ways that are not environmentally friendly. These fish include red snapper, Atlantic salmon, blue-fin tuna, and king crab. Despite these problems, there are several fish that are both healthy and sustainable, such as Alaskan salmon, American catfish, Pacific cod, and several farm-raised fish and shellfish.

        "question": "Because plants cannot move or talk, most people believe that they have no feelings and that they cannot receive signals from outside. However, this may not be completely true. People who studied plants have found out that plants carry a small electrical charge  . It is possible to measure this charge with a small piece of equipment called \"galvanometer\". The galvanometer is placed on a leaf off the plant, and it records any changes in the electrical field of the leaf. Humans have a similar field which can change when we are shocked or frightened. A man called Backster used a galvanometer for his studies of plants and was very surprised at his results. He found that if he had two or more plants in a room and he began to destroy one of them - perhaps by pulling off its leaves or by pulling it out of its pot - then the galvanometer on the leaves of the other plants showed a change in the electrical field. It seemed as if the plants were signalling a feeling of shock. This happened not only when Backster started to destroy plants, but also when he destroyed other living things such as insects  . Backster said that the plants also knew if someone had destroyed a living thing some distance away, because they signalled when a man who had just cut down a tree entered the room. Another scientist, named Sauvin, achieved similar results to Backster's. He kept galvanometers fixed to his plants all the time and checked regularly to see what the plants were doing. If he was out of the office, he telephoned to find out about the signals the plants were sending. In this way, he found that the plants were sending out signals at the exact times when he felt strong pleasure or pain. In fact, Sauvin could cause a change in the electrical field of his plants over a distance of a few miles simply by thinking about them.

On April 15th 2009, when Susan got up to sing, the audience was shocked by her age and simplicity. Middle-aged women were not the usual type of competitor on the show and the audience was even more surprised when she said before starting to sing that she wanted to become a professional singer. To them she looked well past such possibilities. However, she amazed everybody with her wonderful voice and became an overnight singing star. It was reported that the audience all stood up and clapped warmly and that within 9 days, 100 million people had watched her performances and interviews on the Internet. This was a lot of progress for an unemployed woman who lived along with her cat. Most of her life had been spent looking after her mother who had died aged 92, two years earlier.

It listed all the tradesmen in each village in my part of the country and it was impressive to see the great variety of services which were available on one's own doorstep in the late Victorian countryside.        Nowadays a superficial traveler in ruralprefix = st1 /Englandmight conclude that the village tradesmen still flourishing were either selling frozen food to the residents or selling old things to visitors. Nevertheless. This would really be a false impression. There has been smaller village commerce ,but its vigor is still remarkable.        Our local grocer's shop, for example, is actually expanding in spite of the competition from supermarkets in the nearest town. Women prefer to go there and exchange the local news while purchasing, instead of purchasing up at a supermarket. And the shop owner knows well that personal service has a substantial cash value.        His prices may be a bit higher than those in the town, but he will deliver anything at any time. His assistants think nothing of bicycling down the village street in their lunch hour to take a piece of cheese to an aged woman who sent her order by word of mouth with a friend who happened to be passing. The wealthier customers telephone their shopping lists and the goods are on their doorsteps within an hour. I also find it satisfactory because a village shop offers one of the few ways in which a modest individualist can still get along in the world without attaching himself to the big groups of industry or commerce.        Most of the village shopkeepers I know, are individualists in their ways. For example, our shoemaker stares with a cold look at the pairs of cheap, mass-produced shoes taken to him for repair.

Later in the afternoon we tried to catch the fish for dinner, but the fish were smarter than we were. At night we built a fire and sang songs happily. Wednesday: We hiked to the far side of the lake and climbed to the top of a small peak. From there we could see how high the other mountains were and how far the forest spread around us.

        "question": "The coyote  , that clever animal of wide-open spaces, has come to the nation's capital. In fact, coyotes have spread to every corner of the United States, changing their behaviors to fit new environments and causing researchers to deal with a troublesome new kind of creature: the city coyote. The coyote originally lived in the middle of the continent. One of its most obvious characters is its smartness, which has made the animal a notorious   pest. Hunters trapped, shot and poisoned more than a million coyotes in the 1900s. It's still one of America's most hunted animals. Yet the coyote has survived. How has the coyote shown this extraordinary ability? \"I guess if you wanted to use one word, it'd be ' _ ',\" says Eric Gese, an expert at Utah State University. Coyotes can live alone, in pairs, or in large packs like wolves; hunt at night or during the day; occupy a small region or an area up to 40 square miles; and live on all sorts of food, from lizards and shoes, to ants and melons. Unbelievably people helped coyotes increase when they killed most of the wolves in the United States. The spreading of coyotes into city areas, though, is recent. They travel at night, crossing sidewalks and bridges, running along roads and ducking into culverts   and underpasses. No one knows why coyotes are moving into cities, but experts explain that cleverer, more human-tolerant   coyotes are teaching urban survival skills to new generations. Occasionally, coyotes might attack human beings. There have been about 160 attacks on people in recent years. Therefore, people have been consistently told not to feed coyotes or leave pet food unsecured. That, plus a large trapping program in the neighborhood, has cut down on the coyote population.

        "question": "A new study says electronic toys are not helping babies learn. \"Even if companies are marketing them as educational, they're not teaching the babies anything at this time,\" said Anna Sosa the study's author. Researchers listened to audio recordings of parents playing with their babies aged 10 months to 16 months. The researchers compared the experiences when the children played with electronic toys, traditional toys such as blocks, or when the children looked at books. What they found is that parents talked less with their babies when the babies played with electronic toys. Why is this important? Research shows that how quickly children develop language is often based on what they hear from parents. When the infants played with electronic toys, parents said little to their children. But with traditional toys, such as blocks, parents shared the names and descriptions of the animals, colors and shapes as their children played. There was even more information given by parents as their babies looked at the pictures in books. Of course, there is no need for parents to throw out electronic toys, but they should look at their infants' play with such toys as entertainment, not a learning experience. Toy Industry Association spokeswoman Adrienne Appell responded to the study. She said it is important that parents make time to play with their children. \"Playing is a way that kids can learn so much, not only cognitive  skills, but social and developmental skills,\" she said. She added that play should be balanced, including time for just \"make believe\" activities, as well as traditional and electronic toys.

        "question": "Most people want to be successful, but never stop to think what it will really take to get there in their chosen field. If it means going back to college for 2 years of night school, could you do it ? If it means reading a book a week for about 6 months in order to really master a new skill ? If you aren't prepared to do any of those things because they are outside of your comfort zone, then you can forget being succesful. I guarantee you will never reach your goals in life, unless your goals are to be ordinary. The biggest killer by far is the dreaded \" comfort zone \" where most people live in their entire life. And the funny thing is that people just can't wrap their heads around the fact that people who have reached some success get tons of time to just relax, but only because they've earned it ! If you haven't built a successful business, or in some way built a career that allow you so much freee time, then you are stuck in the grinding world of nine-to-five jobs everyone else. So how comfortable is that ? So what can you do about it ? Well, find a way to make something happen in your life--- build a business around your favourite hobby, write a book and publish it, or take a course in stock trading and become an expert at that, working on making enough money to retire. If you don't take massive action that puts your way of your comfort zone, you will never be successful at much of anything. I promise--- and I don't make many promises ! Finding real happiness in life can be a mystery for many. That's why I wrote The Road to Happiness for those who want real success and happiness in life, including spirituality and all the gifts life has to offer. Don't wander aimlessly through life.

The following passage explains very well about this matter.     The first thing you need to do is to become a good listener. In this way, you show your friends that you are interested in their lives. You want to know more about them and you want to help them solve their problems. They will cherish the friendship more if they know you care about them.     The next thing is that you should respect other people's privacy. People usually don't like others to know about their private life, so you should show respect toward their privacy. Sometimes, they need some suggestions from others, but this does not mean that others can know about their entire life. So respect for privacy is a must for keeping a long friendship.  The third important thing is that you need to be able to forgive. You must remember that nobody is perfect in this world. It is important to forgive others not to blame them for the mistakes they have already made. You are not perfect either. Thus you need to apologize to others for the mistakes you may have made.

A study of 192 third and fourth grades, generally aged eight and nine, found that children who cut the number of hours spent watching television gained nearly two pounds (0.91 kg) less over a one-year period than those who did not change their television diet. \"The findings are important because they show that weight loss can only be the result of a reduction in television viewing and not any other activity,\" said Thomas Robinson, a pediatrician  at Stanford University. \" American children spend an average of more than four hours per day watching television and videos or playing games, and rates of childhood being very fat have doubled over the past 20 years,\" Robinson said. In the study, presented this week to the Pediatric Academic Societies' annual meeting in San Francisco, the researchers persuaded about 100 of the students to reduce their television viewing by one-quarter to one-third. Children watching fewer hours of television showed a significantly smaller increase in waist size and had less body fat than other students who continue their normal television viewing, even though neither group ate a special diet nor took part in any extra exercise. \"One explanation for the weight loss could be the children unstuck to the television may simply have been moving around and burning off calories,\" Robinson said. \"Another reason might be due to eating fewer meals in front of the television. Some studies have suggested that eating in front of the TV encourages people to eat more,\" Robinson added. Which of the following is right ?",

Calls to the florist   were always in vain ---- it was a cash purchase. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's identity.  But I never stopped imagining who the anonymous sender might be.  My mother often contributed to these imaginings. She'd ask me if there was someone for whom I had done a special kindness who might be showing appreciation. Perhaps the neighbor I'd help when she was unloading a car full of groceries. Or maybe it was the old man across the street whose mail I retrieved  during the winter so he wouldn't have to venture down his icy steps.  When I was 17, a boy broke my heart. The night he called for me the last time, I cried myself to sleep. When I awoke in the morning, there was a message scribbled  on my mirror in red lipstick: \"Heartily know, when half-gods go, the gods arrive.\" I thought about that quotation from Emerson   for a long time, and I left it where my mother had written it. When I finally went to get the glass cleaner, my mother knew everything was all right again. I don't remember ever slamming  my door in anger at her and shouting, \"You just don't understand!\" because she did understand.     One month before my high-school graduation, my father died suddenly of a heart attack. My feelings ranged from grief to abandonment, fear and over-whelming anger that my dad was missing some of the most important events in my life. I became completely uninterested in my upcoming graduation, the senior-class play and the prom-events  that I had worked on and looked forward to.  But my mother, in the midst of her own grief, would not hear of my missing out any of those things. The day before my father died, she and I had gone shopping for a prom dress and found a spectacular  one. Wearing it made me feel like a princess, but it was the wrong size, and when my father died the next day, I forgot all about the dress. My mother didn't. The day before the prom, I found that dress-in the right size, draped over the living room sofa, presented to me -- beautifully, artistically and lovingly. I didn't care about having a new dress, but my mother did. She wanted her children to feel loved and lovable, creative and imaginative. My mother died when I was 22, only ten days after I was married. That was the year the gardenias stopped coming. According to the passage, who was probably the gardenia sender?",

But I hear that the food is not delicious, and your house is not good. Is it so? Paul: No, that's not true. Go and see! Then Bill goes to the countryside with Paul. Bill: Why do you live in a hole in the field? You should come and live in the city. You would live in a nice house made of stone. You would have better food to eat. You must come and see me at my house in the city. Paul: Thanks! Maybe you are right. I'll visit your house one day.  _ days later Paul goes to Bill's house in the city. The house is big and beautiful. They are sitting in the sitting-room, having a big dinner comfortably. Suddenly, there a great noise. Bill: Run! Run! The cat is coming! Paul: Oh, no! It's terrible!

        "question": "A sunflower is a sunflower. A mobile phone is a mobile phone. But can you combine the two to do something for your local environment? As early as next year it may well be possible. When you have finished with your mobile phone you will be able to bury   it in the garden and wait for it to flower . A biodegradable   mobile phone was, this month, introduced by scientists. It is hoped that the new type of phone will encourage users to recycle. Scientists have come up with a new material over the last five years. It looks like any other plastic and can be hard or soft, and able to change shape. Overtime it can also break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals. British researchers used the new material to develop a phone cover that includes a sunflower seed .When this new type of cover turns into waste, it forms nitrates  . These feed the seed and help the flower grow. Engineers have designed a small transparent   window to hold the seed. They have made sure it only grows when the phone is thrown away. \"We've only put sunflower seeds into the cover so far. But we are working with scientists to find out which flowers would perform best. Maybe we could put roses in next time.\" said one scientist. As phone technology is developing so quickly, people are constantly throwing their mobiles away. This means producers are under pressure to find ways of recycling them. Some 650 million mobile phones have been sold this year. Most of them will be thrown away within two years, adding plastic, heavy metal and chemical waste to the environment. A biodegradable cover can change this, according to the scientists. ,A, B, C, D,. (10) Which of the following is wrong about the cover of the new type of phone?",

Just talking about it or writing it down causes you to make it clear in your own mind.How can you use this to increase your brain power? Start writing. By putting thoughts into words, you are telling yourself the logic   behind what you think, feel, or only partly understand.Often, explaining a thought is the process of understanding.In other words, you increase your brain power by exercising your \"explain power.\" Try this experiment.Explain how you'll increase your brain power, even if you have no idea how right now.Just start with anything, and create an explanation.For example, start with \"I'll learn chess,\" or \"I'll read an article on the mind every week.\" Explain how that will help.You'll be surprised how often this becomes a workable plan, and if you actually do this, you'll have a better understanding of your brain twenty minutes from now. Another benefit of writing is that it helps you remember.Many, if not most, highly productive people are always taking notes.You can try keeping it all in your head, but if you keep a journal of your ideas the next time you're working on a big project, you'll probably have more success.

He lands at the hole and turns his head to expose his white cheeks as a signal to attract the female from where she has been feeding. Among many birds that nest in holes, the male has a light-coloured patch on its plumage  which acts as signal for drawing the female's attention to a suitable nesting-place. Unlike the blue tit, the redstart  may be only the male that strikingly coloured and the female is not beautiful. A few years ago I was lucky enough to spot a pair of redstarts in action in a Walsh wood. The male was leading an interested female to holes that he had previously  checked out. He sat at the entrance of each hole and put his head on to show off his white forehead, or his head in to reveal  his tail. If the female failed to react to his visual signals, the male sometimes sang for extra effect, while gliding towards her on spread wings and tail. Once the female accepts by following the male through the hole the displays stop, you must be at the right place at the right time to watch them. How do the blue tits choose their nest?",

        "question": "The term culture now is more used to describe everything from the fine arts to the outlook of a business group or a sports team. In its original sense, however, culture includes all identifying aspects of a racial group, nation, or empire: its physical environment, history, and traditions, its social rules and economic structure, and its religious beliefs and arts. The central beliefs and customs of a group are handed down from one generation to another. It is for this reason that most people regard culture as learned rather than innate. People acquire a culture because they are not born with one. The process by which a person develops a taste for regional foods, accented speech, or an outlook on the world over time, therefore, is known as enculturation  . Cultures are often identified by their symbols -- images that are familiar and coated with meaning. Totem poles   carved with animals and creative figures suggest aspects of the Native American peoples of the Pacific Northwest but more literally represent specific tribes. In Asia and India, the color1 of yellow is connected with temples while in ancient China it was a color1 only the emperor's family was allowed to wear. Thus, different cultures may respond to a symbol quite differently. For example, to some a flag may represent pride, historical accomplishments, or ideals; to others, however, it can mean danger or oppression.  To individuals unfamiliar with cultures outside their own, the beliefs, behaviors, and artistic expression of other groups can seem strange and even threatening. A society that ranks all other cultures against its own standards is considered to be ethnocentric (from the Greek ethnos, meaning \"people,\" and kentros, meaning \"center\"). A strongly ethnocentric society assumes also that what is different from its own culture is likely to be inferior and, possibly, wrong or evil.  All people are ethnocentric to some degree, and some aspects of ethnocentrism, such as national pride, contribute to a well-functioning society. An appreciation for one's own culture, however, does not prevent acceptance and respect for another culture. History documents the long-term vigor and success of multicultural groups in which people from numerous and various cultural backgrounds live and work together. Extreme ethnocentrism, in contrast, can lead to racism -- the belief that it is race and racial origin that account for variations in human character or ability and that one's own race is superior to all others.

However, the archaeologists working on the excavation  have found that they still have a great deal to do. The sun, the wind and tourists have left their mark on the village, originally discovered by Bernard Bruyere in 1935.     \"From our modern perspective, it is upsetting to see how the village was first excavated and then left to be destroyed. Passers-by have used the huts as rubbish dumps and restrooms,\" says Jaana Toivari-Viitala, a teacher at the University of Helsinki. \"Fortunately, while we still have some surface cleaning to do, conservation are off to a good start.\"     The hut village offers rare insight into everyday life in ancient Egypt.     \"In the early twentieth century, archaeologists were only interested in the tombs of kings. The workmen's huts they discovered were seen as a necessary evil in the quest for the real treasures.\"     \"Now several international research groups on different excavations are examining everyday life and work in the Valley of the Kings. This seems to be a trend in archaeology right now,\" Toivari-Viitala says.     Her research group wants to find out why the hut village was built on the slope of a mountain, halfway between the construction site and Deir-el-Medina. They are also interested in how many workers lived in the village at a time, when they lived there, and what their role was in the construction work.     \"Comparing the names found in the village and in Deir-el-Medina provides useful information. Judging from the construction methods, settlement in the village can be divided into two separate periods: the initial settlement and a later one.\"     For the time being, much is up to guessing, but Toivari-Viitala believes that the coming four field seasons, three months each, will see results.     \"The working conditions are not nearly as difficult as I thought they would be.

Most of them were established in the 19th century; they were designed to offer women the education they could not receive anywhere else. At that time major universities and colleges accepted only men. In the past 20 years many young women have chosen to study at colleges that accept both men and women. As a result some women's colleges decided to accept men students too. Others, however, refused to change. Now these schools are popular again The president of Trinity College in Washington, D. C. said that by the end of the 1980s women began to recognize that studying at the same school with men did not mean women were having an equal chance to learn. The president of Smith College in Massachusetts says a women's college permits women to choose classes and activities freely. For example, she says that in a women's college a higher percentage of students studies mathematics than in a college with both men and women. Educational experts say men students in the United States usually speak in class more than women students do. In a women's college, women feel free to say what they think. Women's schools also bring out leadership capabilities in many women. Women are represented everywhere. For example, at a women's college every governing office is held by a woman. Recent studies reportedly show this leadership continues after college. The studies show that American women who went to women's colleges are more likely to hold successful jobs later in life.

Ten other lucky people will win a cheque for PS100. Once again, we need people who can write good stories. The judges, who include Mary Littlejohn, the novelist, Michael Brown, the television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing, are looking for interesting and original stories. Detective fiction was extremely popular last year, although the competition winner produced a love story. You can write down about whatever you want but here's some advice to start your thinking: Write about what you know This is the advice which every writer should pay attention to and, last year, nearly everyone who wrote for us did exactly that. Love, family, problems with friends ---- these were the main subjects of the stories. However, you need to turn ordinary situations into something interesting that people will want to read about. Make the reader want to continue reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way. Get your facts right It's no good giving a description of a town or explaining how a jet engine works if you get it wrong. So avoid writing anything unless you're certain about it. Hold the reader's attention Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. There is nothing worse than a poor ending. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual happening at the end. Think about the characters Try to bring the people in your story alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real. Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,5000 words and typed, double-spaced, on one side only of each sheet of paper. Even if you're in danger of missing the closing date, we are unable to accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately your story cannot be returned, nor can we discuss our decisions. You should not have had any fiction printed in any magazine or book in this country ---- a change in the rules by popular request ---- and the story must not have happened in print or in recorded form, for example on radio or TV, anywhere in the world. Your fee of PS5 will go to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to: Keep Writing 75 Broad Street Birmingham B12 4TG The closing date is 30 July and we will inform the winner within one month of this date.

What, how, and for whom to produce are problems all over the world because human needs are practically unlimited, but all societies have only limited quantities of resources that can be used to produce goods or services. A knowledge of basic economics is important for understanding both the problems and opportunities that will face the world economy in the 21st century. As a student of economics, one will have the chance to discover how commerce , government policies, and day-to-day decisions made by consumers affect his living standards. The study of economics can help him understand the influence of such events as the move to free markets in prefix = st1 /PolandandRussia, or of ups and downs in interest rate and the foreign exchange rate. Economics is influenced by developments in the many different areas of business, politics, science, nature, religion and history. And whether or not one is aware of it, economics is an important part of his life. From a practical point of view, one's study of economics will help improve his decision-making skills. He learns a logical way to compare different courses of action. As he studies the concept   of opportunity cost, for instance, he will discover that every choice he makes has both a benefit and a cost. Suppose someone decides to get a part-time job so he can earn enough money to buy a car. He will have the benefit of owning the car, but he will pay a cost in terms of the leisure hours he gives up for working so as to pay for the car and keep it in good condition.

It was 2004 and Grennan had given up his job to begin a year-long around-the-world trip, His first three months were spent in Nepal. When he arrived in the village, he knew nothing about the children or the local culture. When he opened the gate of the Little Princes Children's Home, he was faced by the excited children. The young American ended up caring for 18 children. He later discovered that they were trafficked children. So he walked through the mountains with great difficulty to find the kids' families, \"I started walking with photos of the kids.\" he told the Reuters reporter. \"I would show up in villages and show photographs around. I went with 24 photos, and I found 24 families.\" At the same time, he put his heart into Nepalese culture. Grennan said, \"Volunteering is the single best way to see how the rest of the world lives.\" He also encouraged others to do what he had done.

        "question": "The Ghost Bridegroom At the time of this story, there was a great family gathering at the castle to meet the promised bridegroom of the Baron's daughter. An arrangement had been made between the Baron and an old nobleman of Bavaria, Berton, for a marriage between their children. It would increase the importance of both families. The initial plans had been made in the usual way: the young people were engaged without having met each other and the date set for the wedding. The young Count  Von Altenburg had been recalled from the army and was on his way to the castle to meet his promised bride. Messages had been received from Wurtzburg where he was accidentally delayed. The messages indicated the day and time when he might be expected to arrive. The castle was in a fever of preparation to provide him with a suitable welcome. Anne had dressed with particular care. Bertha and Wilda had selected her clothing and quarreled all morning about what she should wear. The young lady had taken advantage of their arguments to wear exactly what she wanted and had chosen very well. She looked as beautiful as any young bridegroom could wish for, and the excitement made her look even lovelier. The two aunts constantly directed her, as single aunts usually take a great interest in the love affairs of others. They were giving her the final instructions on how to behave, what to say, and how to greet her intended husband. Hour by hour passed. The sun, which had been so warm over the rich forests of the Odenwald, was now setting along the tops of the mountains. The Baron went to the tallest tower in the castle to see if he could see any sign of the Count and his escorts. Once, he thought he saw them. The sound of horns came floating up from the valley. A party of men was seen far below, riding slowly along the road. It was a false alarm, for when they reached the foot of the mountain, they suddenly rode off in a different direction. The sun, by now, had set, and the bats began to fly about in the evening light. It was getting dark, and the only movement on the road was the occasional worker returning home.

And over here, a class of students watching it all. A field trip to a nature center? No, it's a schoolyard. With some work on your part, it could even be your schoolyard. Interested in building a schoolyard habitat? Here's how to get started. Gather a Team Students can do a lot on their own, but you'll need adults for a project this big. Get teachers, parents,  and  even  the  headmaster  interested.  Don't  forget  the  maintenance staff--they know more about your school's yard than anyone else and can give you lots of help. Also, ask around your neighborhood for gardeners, naturalists, and others willing to give advice. Map Your Site Which part of the schoolyard can you turn  into a habitat? Is there an unused corner of the playground? Part of a lawn or field you could let go wild? You'll need to make a map of the area showing what's  there now. Then  you  can  figure out  how you want  to  change  it. For  that, you need a plan. Plan a Habitat Here's what you'll need to make your area attractive to wildlife. Food: Plant  flowers, bushes,  and  trees. These  provide  seeds, berries,  leaves,  flowers,  and sweet  liquids.  And  all  of  these  feed  birds,  and  insects.  You  can  also  add  some  feeders  for squirrels and birds. Where possible, stick with native plants--wild plants that grow naturally in your area. They need less care, which means less work for you. Water: A  small pond, birdbath, or  even  a  shallow dish  of  clean water  in  the ground will attract birds. Other small animals like insects may visit as well. Shelter: Bushes and trees make great escapes for birds. Tall grass and \"weeds\" are home to grasshoppers, garter  snakes,  and  some  ground-nesting birds. You  can  also  add  stone  piles  and brush piles. Places to Raise Young: Butterflies need special plants to lay their eggs on. Frogs and toads lay eggs only  in shallow water. Many birds use birdhouses; others nest  in  trees and bushes.  In fact, nearly all your shelters may become homes for wild young. Put It on Paper Using the map you made of your area, draw in the changes you want to make. Mark where the plants, nest boxes, and other items will go. Remember, this is a long-term plan--you don't have  to  do  everything  this  spring. Maybe  you  could  put  up  a  few  birdhouses  and  plant  some butterfly bushes now and save the trees and bushes for next year. Even a small start is a big step for wildlife. Reach for Resources To make the habitat happen, you'll need lots of plants, seeds, and other supplies. You'll also need to buy or borrow tools and maybe even some heavy equipment. Now's the time to reach out for donations. Start by asking your parent-teacher organization. Then go to garden clubs, garden stores (they might give you a discount), local government agencies, and businesses. If they can't donate supplies or money, ask if they can donate workers! The workers can help build  the habitat. You'll also need people  to help maintain  it. Some schools ask their students' families to take turns during the summer. Each family maintains  the habitat for a couple of weeks. Build Your Design Now you can dig in. Set a date, and get growing! How has the author organized the article?",

Grandpa Peter heard all about it and said, \"This sounds like a job for Tubby.\" So Andy's parents loaded the cat onto the car and returned home. That night, at bedtime, the same problem happened. Andy didn't want to go to bed, and even though his parents waited a while to see if Tubby would solve the problem, nothing happened. [:++Z+X+X+K] Hours later, Andy finally decided to go to bed. But what a surprise when he entered his bedroom! Tubby was in his bed, totally sprawling out, pot-belly in the air, and _ like an express train. Andy tried to move the cat, but there was no way of moving him an inch. That night he hardly slept, lying on one tiny corner of his bed. The next day the same thing happened, even though Andy was much more tired from not having slept well. When the third day arrived, he had understood that if he wanted to sleep in his bed, he would have to get into it before Tubby did. That night, when his parents only started to mention the topic of bedtime, Andy rushed upstairs and dived into bed. His parents could not believe it. They knew nothing about Tubby in the bed, nor did they understand why Andy went to bed on time without complaint. They were so happy about this that they stayed up quite late, celebrating.

Dye your Easter eggs.With an adult's help, dye hard-boiled eggs red using food coloring or egg dye.For a nice sheen, use a paper towel to rub some oil on each egg.But don't use too much oil---you wouldn't want your egg to slide out of your hand when you play the egg-cracking game!

        "question": "In its early history, Chicago had floods frequently, especially in the spring, making the streets so muddy that people, horses, and carts got stuck. An old joke that was popular at the time went something like this: A man is stuck up to his waist in a muddy Chicago street. Asked if he needs help, he replies, \"No, thanks. I've got a good horse under me.\" The city planner decided to build an underground drainage   system, but there simply wasn't enough difference between the height of the ground level and the water level. The only two options were to lower the Chicago River or raise the city. An engineer named Ellis Chesbrough convinced me the city that it had no choice but to build the pipes above ground and then cover them with dirt. This raised the level of the city's streets by as much as 12 feet. This of course created a new problem: dirt practically buried the first floors of every building in Chicago. Building owners were faced with a choice: either change the first floors of their buildings into basements, and the second stories into main floors, or _ the entire buildings to meet the new street level. Small wood-frame buildings could be lifted fairly easily. But what about large, heavy structures like Tremont Hotel, which was a six-story brick building? That's where George Pullman came in. He had developed some house-moving skills successfully. To lift a big structure like the Tremont Hotel, Pullman would place thousands of jackscrews   beneath the building's foundation. One man was assigned to operate each section of roughly 10 jackscrews. At Pullman's signal each man turned his jackscrew the same amount at the same time, thereby raising the building slowly and evenly. Astonishingly, the Tremont Hotel stay open during the entire operation, and many of its guests didn't even notice anything was happening. Some people like to say that every problem has a solution. But in Chicago's early history, every engineering solution seemed to create a new problem. Now that Chicago's waste water was draining efficiently into the Chicago River, the city's next step was to clean the polluted river. The author mentions the joke to show   _  .",

        "question": "SAN FRANCISCO -- In the western U.S., Hawaii and elsewhere across the globe, moon watchers were treated on Saturday to a rare celestial  phenomenon: a total lunar eclipse  . For about 50 minutes starting at 6:06 a.m. PST, the moon was completely blocked by the Earth's shadow. With only some indirect sunlight able to reach it after passing through the Earth's atmosphere, the moon took on a reddish weak light. Since the atmosphere scatters  blue light, only red light strikes the moon, giving it a dark red color1. Dally Sam, who runs a public relations firm in Hawaii, said it had been cloudy and rainy, but the weather cleared just in time for the eclipse. Around 3 a.m., he awoke, as he usually does, and remembered to step outside the house in time to catch the beginning of the eclipse about a half hour later. No one else in the neighborhood was up then. \"It was turning that dark red color1,\" Sayre, aged 47, said, \"I'd better get a camera. To be able to see it just right outside our house was really cool.\" At the local observatory in Los Angeles, some 300 people, many holding coffee cups in the cold morning air, sat with blankets and chairs on the observatory's great grass land. \"It's really a celestial festival out here,\" John Peter, aged 39, told the Los Angeles Times as he set up his camera. Lying on a slope  north of downtown near the Hollywood sign, the place offers clear views of the sky. Observatory officials reminded the crowd when the eclipse began and big applause burst when the celestial event ended.

        "question": "Expressing emotions is important rather than hiding them or keeping them inside. Everyone feels negative emotions such as anger and needs to deal with them. But there are healthy ways to express anger and ways to control it. Shouting bad words at someone will hurt the other person or make them angry too. If you feel angry, it is best to think before you speak. Some people in the UK use the expression \"take a deep breath and count to 10\", meaning take a pause, breathe deeply and let yourself calm down instead of getting angry. Another expression people use to say they are controlling their anger is \"biting their lip\". This means not letting the bad words come out of their mouth. If you cannot think of anything but bad words, it is probably best to \"bite your lip.\" But sometimes letting all your anger out can be cathartic , as long as you do it at the right place and time. If you have just had a bad day, you could go into a room by yourself and scream or yell very loudly. Or if you want to hit someone or smash something, you could hit a pillow instead. Then after you let your frustration out this way, you'll be able to deal with your problems more calmly. If you do lose your temper with someone and swear at them, though, you need to apologize. One way to do this is to say \"pardon my French\". This expression has been used for many years as an apology for bad language. Then you can calmly explain what made you upset.

Beyond your genes Sonja, a professor of psychology at University of California Riverside, analyzed studies on identical twins and concluded that happiness is 50 percent genetic, 40 percent intentional and 10 percent circumstantial. \"Your circumstances-where you live, your health, your work, your marriage-can be tough to change .But most people are surprised that circumstances don't account for as much of their happiness as they think,\"she said. Life circumstances don't result in continuous happiness, she says, because we adapt.That new car, promotion or house feels great at first.Then we get used to it. Keeping that good feeling requires something else: control of how you act and think.                               Happiness definition To gain happiness, you need to understand what happiness is. Martin Seligman, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says happiness is the pursuit of engaging and meaningful activities.  By \"engaging\", he means when we get so absorbed in what we are doing that we lose track of time.\"Meaningful\" would be using what you are best at to serve others or to participate in a cause that's bigger than yourself.  \"Your purpose doesn't have to be giant,\" says psychologist Dan Baker. \"If you'reyou're your purpose can be getting into the college of your choice.When you're a parent, it can be getting your kids off to school safely and prepared for each day.

According to the survey analysis, economic growth helped promote happiness for some, while Democratization and rising social tolerance contributed even more.  Democracy provides more choice, which promotes happiness.Support for sex equality and tolerance of people who are different from oneself are also strongly linked.This is not just because tolerant people are happier, but because living in a tolerant society strengthens everyone's freedom.

Was there an argument? If the main reason you haven't been getting together with the people you already know is that you have gotten too busy, take a good look at how you spend your time. Compare it with your real values and priorities  in life. Is your busy lifestyle really bringing you the quality of life that you want? If you have become too busy for friends, why has this happened?

It's hard to believe, but you can find out a number of things about a woman's personality just by looking at the type of handbag she carries. Below you will find a number of handbag styles and colors as well as what each specific type of handbag says about the owner. Styles: Under-the Shoulder - handbags which are smaller and fit tightly underneath the shoulder indicate class and sophistication. A women working in an upscale office or someone of high status would choose this form of handbag. Big and Bulky - Big, bulky and oversized bags are casual and are often associated with younger individuals. These are used for individuals who carry a number of things (binders, books etc) and require a lot of space. Down-to-earth, lower-maintenance women would carry this type of handbag. Designer - Designer handbags often cost an arm and a leg and therefore are usually associated with high-maintenance females. Females who are confident and require top of the line accessories will settle for nothing less than a name-brand designer purse. Guys watch out for these girls, they tend to be a handful. Cigar Box Purses - A women who carries a cigar box purse likes to be unique and stand out from the crowd. These women have minds of their own and cannot be told what to do.

Piloting the plane was Captain Thomas Nash. Looking westward, Nash saw twelve orange lights in a row, moving at a fantastic rate of speed. An old experienced flyer, he had never seen anything like them. Thinking they might be a new German weapon, he decided to give chase. But when he swung the plane around and headed directly for the lights, they disappeared.      Captain Nash may have been the first to see such orange lights but he wasn't the last. His experience was repeated many times by pilots during World WarIIboth in Europe and the Far East. Pilots in the Korean War also reported seeing the strange lights.      What were they? No one knows for sure, but there is an interesting theory to account for them. According to this theory, the orange lights are space animals -- animals specially adapted to life in the upper atmosphere just as some creatures are adapted to life at the bottom of the sea.     These space animals, the theory says, live so far up in the atmosphere that they are not visible from earth. They feed partly on the air and partly on energy from sunlight. Being almost pure energy themselves, they can adjust their bodies to glow   at night. During the day they become invisible.  Before World War II, continues the theory, there was little radiated   energy available on the earth's surface. Then came the development of rockets, atomic reactors  , and hydroelectric plants  . The space creatures are attracted to these sources of energy of food. At night when there is no energy from sunlight, they go down into the lower levels in search of a meal. They may even drift into the range of human eyesight. This explains the fact that they have been sighted regularly from the earth since 1943.

They like fish soup, diced potato, tender and soft vegetables... \"I must also keep fit by doing physical exercise. If my parents are too weak to move around, I can be strong enough to take care of them. When I am old, my son can also pay less attention to taking care of me...\" When I read this, I felt very sorry. I used to complain that Mom didn't understand me and couldn't give me everything I wanted. I always thought there was a wide gap  between us. But now I completely understand her. How great she is! She always thinks of others before herself. Everything she does is to help the people she loves live better lives. How unselfish her love is! Why did mom change her cooking way?",

        "question": "Dolphins are not fish. They are mammals  .They live in groups and speak to each other in their own language. But they are quite different from almost all land animals. Their brain is as big as men's and they live a long life at least 20 or 30 years. Like some animals, dolphins use sounds to help them find their way around. They also use these sounds to talk to each other and to help them find food. They do not use their ears to receive sounds,but use the jaw--the lower part of the mouth. It is strange that dolphins are friendly to men, and for thousands of years, there are many stories about dolphins and men. In the 19th century, in a dangerous part of the sea near New Zealand,there was a dolphin. The seamen liked him very much and gave him a very good name, Jack. From 1871 to 1903 ,Jack met every boat in the area and showed it the way. In 1903 a passenger on a boat with the name of The Penguin shot and hurt Jack. Luckily the dolphin didn't die, and after a long time he was well again. He guided the ships through the area for nine more years, but he refused to help the boat of the Penguin. Today, some people still kill dolphins, but many countries in the world now protect them. In these places, people are not allowed to kill them. Who was Jack?",

        "question": "If you want to become a fluent English speaker you should take some advice. There are four skills in learning English. They are reading, listening, speaking, and writing. The most important thing you must remember is that if you want to improve your speaking and writing skills, you should first master the skills of reading and listening. Read as much as you can. But your reading must be active. It means that you must think about the meaning of the sentence, the meaning of the unfamiliar words, etc. There is no need for you to pay much attention to grammars or try to understand all the unfamiliar words you _ , but the fact that you see them for the first time and recognize them whenever you see them, for example, in other passages or books, is enough. It would be better to prepare yourself a notebook so you can write down the important words or sentences in it. As for listening, there are two choices: besides reading, you can listen every day for about 30 minutes. You can only pay attention to your reading and become skillful at your reading, then you can catch up on your listening. Since you have lots of inputs in your mind, you can easily guess what the speaker is going to say. This never means that you should not practice listening. For listening you can listen to cartoons or some movies that are specially made for children. Their languages are easy. Or if you are good at listening you can listen to VOA or BBC programs every day. Again the thing to remember is being active in listening and preferably taking some notes. If you follow these pieces of advice, your speaking and writing will improve quickly, and you can be a fluent English speaker one day.

They drive a $1 million, fuel-cell-powered car. It may be the world's most expensive car and one of the most environmentally friendly cars. The FCX is the first fuel-cell-powered car to be used by a family anywhere in the world. The FCX uses hydrogen and oxygen for fuel. Car makers have been working to develop vehicles that are better for the environment. They are developing cars that use fuel other than gasoline. And then what is fuel cell technology? Fuel cell technology works by changing the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water. This process produces electricity, and water vapor which comes out of the exhaust pipe. Most cars release dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Many scientists say these gases are major contributors to global warming. \"The FCX is driven just like any other vehicle on the road, but without the gases which pollute the environment,\" scientists say. Fuel cell technology has been around since the 1800s, but scientists have yet been to perfect it. They say it may take years before the technology is ready for widespread use. Another earth-friendly car is already on the market. Hybrid cars use both gasoline and an electric motor. They are becoming more popular with customers because they cut pollution and improve fuel efficiency. Which of the following about the FCX is not true?",

Without snakes, perhaps we would find mice everywhere. Most of us, however, would rather see a mouse than a snake. The poison argument   is a strong one. Some snakes are poisonous, and this causes people's death. However, the poisonous snakes are only a small number. We can't say all the snakes are bad just because of a few dangerous ones. And what do we do with the people who really like snakes? They like snakes even more strongly than we dislike them. These people learn about them, find them out, and watch them carefully. Why? The only reason I can think of is that these people are open-minded. They are able to put aside differences and welcome the snake as a friend. Whatever the reason for our like or dislike, snakes do something good in the circle of life. They would prefer to be left alone, and that is what we should do.

Martin was aware that colleagues approached these meetings with hidden agenda ; they indulged in  game playing; and he knew that people were not being honest and open.The meetings themselves were bad enough-there was all the moaning afterwards at the meeting like\"I could have improved on that idea,but I wasn't going to say\". As this morning's meeting began,Martin prepared himself for the usual dullness and boredom.But,as the meeting progressed,he became aware of a strange background noise.At first,he thought that he was still hearing the engine noise from the aircraft that had brought him back to London.But,as he concentrated on the noise,it became a little clearer. He realized,to his amazement,that he could actually hear what they were thinking at the same time as they were speaking.What surprised him,even more than the acquisition of this strange power,was that he discovered that what people were saying was not really what they were thinking.They were not making clear their reservations.They were not supporting views which they thought might be popular.They were not contributing their new insights.They were not volunteering their new ideas. Martin found it impossible not to respond to his new knowledge.So he started to make gentle interventions,based more on what he could hear his colleagues thinking than on what he could hear them saying.\"So,John,are you really saying...\"\"Susan,do you really think that?\"\"Tom,have you got an idea on how we could take this forward?\"They looked at him,puzzled.In truth,he felt rather proud of his newly-acquired talent. As the meeting progressed,it was clear to him that each member of the meeting was learning how to hear the thoughts of the others.The game playing started to fall away; people started to speak more directly; views became better understood; the atmosphere became more open and trusting. The meeting ended.As people left the room,Martin found that he could still hear what they were thinking.\"That was the best meeting we've ever had.\"\"All meetings should be like that.\"\"In future,I'm going to say what I think\".

For the first time, researchers have discovered a genetic recipe that accurately predicts who may live to 100 and beyond. Analysis shows that 90% of the participants who lived to 100 had at least one of the signature genetic clusters . Dr. Thomas Perls at the Boston University School of Medicine said, \"We realize this is a complex genetic puzzle. There is a long way for us to go to understand how the integration of these genes--not just with themselves but with environmental factors--is playing a role in this long life puzzle.\" Perls has studied many factors that contribute to long life, and he is the first to acknowledge that living longer isn't likely to be simply a matter of genes. His previous work has shown, for example, that among most elderly people who live into their 70s and 80s, about 70% can owe their long life to environmental factors such as not smoking; eating a healthy, low-fat, low-calorie diet; and remaining socially engaged and mentally active throughout life. It seems clear that those who live extremely long are benefiting from a special DNA. In fact, Perls believes that the older a person gets, the more likely it is that his or her genes are contributing to those extended years. Perls may most likely agree that  _  .",

Different people may choose different ways to deal with it, and for most people a break for a 10-minute walk may be quite useful.www.zxxk.com Anyway, here is another way around: to get a piece of chewing gum, and chew it. According to a Swinburne University of Technology study, gum-chewing has been found to \"relieve anxiety, improve alertness  and reduce stress among individuals in a laboratory setting.\" Some may argue that a laboratory is not the same as an office. But check out the conditions of the study: individuals were monitored while performing \"a group of 'multi-tasking' activities.\" Doesn't it sound like the situation in the office?www.zxxk.com Here's a summary of some of the study's findings: Gum chewers showed a reduction in anxiety as compared to non-gum chewers by nearly 17 percent during mild stress and nearly 10 percent in appropriate stress. Gum chewers showed improvement in alertness over non-gum chewers by nearly 19 percent during mild stress and 8 percent in moderate stress. Improved Performance: Chewing gum resulted in a big improvement in overall performance on multi-tasking activities. Although these aren't major improvements, every little bit works and chewing a piece of gum is a lot quicker and easier than slipping outside for a 10-minute walk. So, how does gum work this magic? In part it does so by lowering the level of cortisol --a steroid  hormone that is released in response to stress in your system. A few words of advice before you reach for the gum: don't crack your gum, and be sure to chew it with your mouth closed. In fact, I'd say keep the gum out of meetings, because it really looks impolite to others around you. From the study in the text we know that  _  .",

Then just last year the city put a chain link fence around the park and started bulldozing the trees and grass to make way for a new apartment complex. When I saw the fence and bulldozers, I asked myself,\"Why don't they just leave it alone?\" Looking back, I think what sentenced the park to oblivion was the drought we had about four years ago. Up until then, Southway Park was a nice green park with plenty of trees and a public swimming pool. My friends and I rollerskated on the sidewalks, climbed the trees, and swam in the pool all the years I was growing up. The park was almost like my own yard. Then the summer I was fifteen the drought came and things changed. There had been almost no rain at all that year. The city stopped watering the park grass. Within a few weeks I found myself living across the street from a huge brown desert. Leaves fell off the park trees, and pretty soon the trees started dying, too. Next, the park swimming pool was closed. The city cut down on the work force that kept the park, and pretty soon it just got too ugly and dirty to enjoy anymore. As the drought lasted into the fall, the park got worse every month. The rubbish piled up or blew across the brown grass. Soon the only people in the park were beggars and other people down on their luck. People said drugs were being sold or traded there now. The park had gotten scary, and my mother told us kids not to go there anymore. The drought finally ended and things seemed to get back to normal, that is, everything but the park. It had gotten into such bad shape that the city just let it stay that way. Then about six months ago I heard that the city was going to\"redevelop\"certain wornout areas of the city. It turned out that the city had planned to get rid of the park, sell the land and let someone build rows of apartment buildings on it. The chainlink fencing and the bulldozers did their work. Now we live across the street from six rows of apartment buildings. Each of them is three units high and stretches a block in each direction. The neighborhood has changed without the park. The streets I used to play in are jammed with cars now. Things will never be the same again.   _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _     _ How did the writer feel when he saw the fence and bulldozers?",

For years March (possibly be wisest philosopher of management) has studied how humans think and act, and he continues to do so in his new bookThe Ambiguities of Experience. He begins by reminding us of just how firmly we have been sticking to the idea of experiential learning: \"Experience is respected;experience is sought;experience is explained.\" The problem is that learning from experience involves serious complications  , ones that are part of the nature of experience itself and which March discusses in the body of this book. In one interesting part of the book, for example, he turns a doubtful eye toward the use of stories as the most effective way of experiential learning. In our efforts to make stories interesting, he argues, we lose part of the complicated truth of things. He says \"The more accurately reality is presented, the less understandable the story, and the more understandable the story, the less realistic it is.\" Besides being a broadly knowledgeable researcher, March is also a poet, and his gift shines through in the depth of views he offers and the simple language he uses. Though the book is short, it is demanding: Don't pick it up looking for quick, easy lessons. Rather, be ready to think deeply about learning from experience in work and life.

        "question": "In 1977, Irene Pepperberg of Harvard University began studying what was on another creature's mind by talking to it. Her first experiments began with Alex. Alex was a one-year-old African grey parrot and Irene taught him to produce the sounds of the English language. \"I thought if he learned to communicate, I could ask him questions about how he sees the world.\" At the time, most scientists didn't believe animals had any thoughts. They thought animals were more like robots but didn't have the ability to think or feel. Of course, if you own a pet you probably disagree. But it is the job of a scientist to prove this and nowadays more scientists accept that animals can think for themselves. \"That's why I started my studies with Alex,\" Irene said, \"Some people actually called me crazy for trying this.\" Nowadays, we have more and more evidence that animals have all sorts of mental abilities. Sheep can recognize faces. Chimpanzees   use a variety of tools and even use weapons to hunt. And Alex the parrot became a very good talker. Thirty years after the Alex studies began. Irene was still giving him English lessons up until his recent death. For example, if Alex was hungry he could say \"want grape\". Alex could count to six and was learning the sounds for seven and eight. \"He has to hear the words over and over before he can correctly say them.\" Irene said, after pronouncing \"seven\" for Alex a few times in a row. Alex could also tell the difference between colors, shapes, sizes, and materials (e.g. wood and metal). Before he finally died, Alex managed to say \"seven\". Another famous pet that proved some animals have greater mental skills was a dog called Rico. He appeared on a German TV game show in 2011. Rico knew the names of 200 different toys and easily learned the names of new ones. When Rico became famous, many other dog owners wanted to show how clever their pets were. Another dog called Betsy could understand 300 words. One theory for dogs' ability to learn a language is that they have ben close companions to humans for many centuries and so their ability to understand us is constantly evolving  . While animals can't do what humans do yet, some scientists believe that examples like Alex and Rico prove that evolution develops intelligence, as well as physical appearance. Irene wanted to find out   _  .",

        "question": "Scientists have searched for many years for a method to tell whether a volcano explosion will be small or large. Now, four scientists say they have discovered something in lava that will help do this. They did the research on Mount Unzen on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu.  Mount Unzen exploded in November, 1990. Since then, more explosions have killed 43 people and destroyed the homes of more than 2,000 others. The volcano is still active today.  The scientists say the lava of the volcano contains high level of an element ,which is a sign of the presence of the lava from deep in the earth, not from the surface. They say it shows that the lava coming directly from inside the earth is connected with huge explosions instead of smaller ones.  The scientists examined the lava from 18 explosions of Mount Unzen that took place during many thousands of years. They also studied the lava from other volcanoes in the area that are older than Mount Unzen. The lava studied came from both large and small explosions. The scientists found that large explosions contained more of the element than small ones. The scientists say if they had known this two years earlier, they could have warned the people living in the area near Mount Unzen and saved many lives.

My grandmother died just over two years ago. At 91, she had spent 30 years without her right leg, which was removed due to cancer the year I was born. She was a poet, an artist, a food lover and a salt cellar collector. The funny thing about the salts, as she called them -- I never once heard her say salt cellar -- was that although everybody knew they were her hobby and everyone was always searching for them at yard sales or in stores, nobody seemed to know what they meant to her and they just wanted to make her happy. Grandma kept her salts in a dark wooden corner display case in the living room. Since her death the case has remained exactly as she left it. Grandpa tries his best to preserve his memories of her just as they are.  Now I am collecting, too. Collecting memories about my grandmother's hobby, a way she spent her time. And as I hold one of them in my hand, I picture her holding it in her hand on the day she got it. She is smiling. My mother and her two sisters all have small collections, but my mother admits that she was more interested in finding salts to send to Grandma.  Grandma once wrote a poem titled \"When April Comes\". The poem contains the line, \"When April comes and I am not around, remember me when daffodils are found.\" Now, Grandpa is working on a poem with the line, \"April came and you were not around\".

They were told that these five were the most excellent students in the class. But the fact was that these students were only average ,and they were not the best students at all. Well, guess what? At the end of the year, all the five average students scored among the highest in the class. What made these average students change so much to become top students?The only difference was the change in their teachers' attitude . Because the teachers believed that these five kids were the top students,they expected  more from them. And so these five average students began to believe and expect more from themselves. So they worked harder to do as well as they could. Do you know why? If you expect the best from people, they'll usually want to give you their best. A great leader said, \"Treat  a person just how he appears to be on the outside, and you'll make him even worse. But treat a person like he's already a success,and you'll help make him the best he can be.\" Like the true story of 7-year-old Johnny, his teacher got so angry with him that one day she said,\"Johnny,you're the naughtiest  boy in this class. I'm sure you'll never change.\" The next year Johnny had a new teacher. And on the first day of class,she met with Johnny after school and said,\"Johnny, I've heard a lot about you! But do you know that I don't believe a word of it.\" And every day after that, this new teacher treated Johnny as if he was one of the smartest students even when Johnny did naughty things.

        "question": "The English expect each other to observe the rules of queuing, feel highly offended when these rules are broken, but lack the confidence or social skills to express their annoyance in a straightforward manner. In other countries, this is not a problem: in America, where a queue-jumper has committed a kind of rudeness rather than a sin, the response is a loud warning: the offender is simply told \"Hey, you, get back in line!\" or words to that effect. On the European continent, the reaction tends to be loud and argumentative; in some other parts of the world, queue-jumpers may simply be pushed back into line. Ironically  , it is only in England, where queue-jumping is regarded as deeply immoral, that the queue-jumper is likely to get away with the offence. Only rarely do the English actually speak up and tell the jumper to go to the back of the queue. Queuing is almost a national pastime for the English, who automatically arrange themselves into orderly lines at bus stops, shop counters, ice-cream vans, entrances, exits, and lifts. In 1946, a Hungarian humorist described queuing as English \"national passion\". \"On the continent,\" he said. \"if people are waiting at a bus stop they walk around in a seemingly relaxed fashion. When the bus arrives they make a dash   for it...An Englishman, even if he is alone, forms orderly queue of one.\" In an update over thirty years later in 1977 he confirmed that this was still the case. After nearly another thirty years nothing much seems to have changed. In many cases, queue-jumping is effectively prevented by non-verbal   signals alone. When someone is considering jumping a queue, the queuers will start glancing at him sideways, through narrowed, suspicious eyes. Then they move a bit closer to the person in front of them, just in case the jumper might try to insert himself in the gap. Frowns, glares, and raised eyebrows -- accompanied by heavy sighs, pointed coughs -- are usually the worst that the person will suffer if he jumps a queue. Faced with all this, the jumper will think better of it and withdraw to the back of the queue. What is the best title of this passage?",

A study of more than 1,000 Scottish 70-year-olds found that those who had had complex jobs scored better on memory and thinking tests. One theory is that a more stimulating environment helps build up a \"cognitive reserve\" to help buffer the brain against age-related decline. The research was reported in Neurology. The team, from Heriot-Watt University, in Edinburgh, is now planning more work to look at how lifestyle and work interact to affect memory loss. Those taking part in the study took tests designed to assess memory, processing speed and general thinking ability, as well as filling in a questionnaire about their working life. The analysis showed that those whose jobs had required complex skills in dealing with data or people, such as management and teaching, had better scores on memory and thinking tests than those who had done less mentally intense jobs such as factory workers, bookbinders, or carpet layers. While the study did not look at biological reasons for the protective effect of certain jobs, potential explanations include that structural changes within the brain mean less damage is accumulated over time. Study leader Dr Alan Gow said: \"Our findings have helped to identify the kinds of job demands that preserve memory and thinking later on.\" \"However,\" He added, \"while it is true that people who have higher cognitive abilities are more likely to get more complex jobs, there still seems to be a small advantage gained from these complex jobs for later thinking skills.\" Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the study added to the growing evidence about factors that affected brain health as we aged. \"Keeping the brain active throughout life could be helpful and different types of work may play a role. However, it's important to note that this study points to a small and subtle association between occupation and later-life cognition rather than offering proof that people's occupation has a direct influence.\" According to the research, who may have the best memory in old age?",

People who increased their intake over just six weeks developed a healthy glow and appeared more attractive, researchers found. Scientists at St Andrews University found eating them subtly increased yellow and red pigments in the volunteers' skin. They monitored the food intake of 35 people and took pictures of their faces, arms and hands using a sensitive camera at the start, and after three and six weeks. Increasing their intake of greens by 2.9 portions a day was found to make the person look healthier and an extra 3.3 portion could enhance their attractiveness, when their photographs were rated by others. Fruit and vegetables are rich in carotenoids , which are known to protect against cell damage from pollution and UV rays, and can also prevent age-related diseases including heart disease and cancer. But while it was known eating extreme amounts of certain vegetables such as carrots could turn skin orange, it was not known a small increase was perceptible to others and was seen as  _ . A camera measured changes to the skin's redness, yellowness and lightness, and found it significantly changed in people who naturally increased their intake. These changes were not evident at three weeks. Using light sensors, the researchers showed these red and yellow hues(,) were linked with the levels of carotenoids in their skin. There are hundreds of carotenoids but those thought to have the most dramatic effect are lycopene which gives tomatoes and red peppers their red color1 - and beta-carotene found in carrots as well as broccoli, squash, and spinach.

        "question": "During the past Spring Festival, many children may have received red packets from their families. But Xing Pu, a 40-year-old economist, is asking the government to give red packets to every Chinese citizen. Xing suggested the government give out 1,000 Yuan to each Chinese since the government income has increased rapidly in recent years. He said his suggestion would allow everyone to directly enjoy the fruits of the country's economic success, help the lower-income groups deal with rising prices and increase consumption around the country. Recent years have seen the government carry out a series of pro-poor   and pro-rural policies, including increasing spending on public healthcare and calling off the agricultural tax. But the lower-income group still needs more help while being hit hard by an 11-year high in prices and recent snowstorms. Xing said while making the draft, he has borrowed many ideas from practices in countries like the United States and Singapore. Earlier this year, the governments of the two nations offered cash handouts to their citizens as the result of a surplus in government income. As for in China, \"We can even encourage the rich to donate their 1,000 Yuan red packet to the poor,\" said Xing. Although Xing's suggestion has gained wide support among ordinary Chinese on the Internet, many other economists criticized it as unpractical. Even Xing himself admitted he made the suggestion without any careful calculation. But they agreed with Xing's point that the growing economic pie should be shared among the people. \"To better use the increase of money, handing out money is not a solution that holds good for all time. It could be better to improve the public service or cut the price of energy use in daily life,\" said Qiao Xinsheng, an economic professor.

You should always go to a doctor for advice before you begin any type of exercise program. Then, a good pair of running shoes can be helpful as your feet hit the ground. They will help protect your ankles by providing stability to your feet. So it is good idea to visit a specialty  running shoe store.

They can provide good tips as well as some support and encouragement for you. Lastly, it is important to start out slowly. When it comes to getting in shape and losing weight , short bursts of speed followed by periods of slower movement would be proper. Aim for around 30 minutes of exercise a few days a week. As you get better, you can increase your speed. Always allow your body to rest in between heavy exercise as your muscles need time to bring energy back.

        "question": "Do women's minds work the same as men's? Absolutely not. At least, that is what most men are convinced of. Psychologists view the subject either as a matter or frustration or a joke. Now the biologists have moved into this minefield, and some of them have found that there are real differences between the brains of men and women. But being different, they point out hurriedly, is not the same as being better or worse. There is, however, a definite structural variation between the male and female brain. The difference is in a part of the brain that is used in the most complex intellectual processes-the link between the two halves of the brain. The two halves are linked by a trunkline of between 200 and 300 million nerves, the corpus callosum. Scientists have found quite recently that the corpus callosum in women is always larger and probably richer in nerve fibres than it is in men. This is the first time that a structural difference has been found between the brains of women and men and it must have some significance. The question is \"What?\", and, if this difference exists, are there others? Research shows that present-day women think differently and behave differently from men. Are some of these differences biological and inborn, a result of evolution? We tend to think that is the influence of society that produces these differences. But could we be wrong? Research showed that these two halves of the brain had different functions, and that the corpus callosum enabled them to work together. For most people, the left half is used for word handing, analytical and logical activities; the right half works on pictures, patterns and forms. We need both halves working together. And the better the connections, the more harmoniously the two halves work. And, according to research findings, women have the better connections. But it isn't all that easy to explain the actual differences between skills of men and women on this basis. In schools throughout the world girls tend to be better than boys at \"language subjects\" and boys better at maths and physics. If these differences correspond with the differences in the hemispheric trunkline, here is an unalterable distinction between the sexes. We shan't know for a while, partly because we don't know of any precise relationship between abilities in school subject and the functioning of the two halves of the brain, and we cannot understand how the two halves interact via the corpus callosum. But this striking difference must have some effect and, because the difference is in the parts of the brain involved in intellect, we should be looking for differences in intellectual processing.

        "question": "For some years the big drugmakers have been worrying about an approaching \"patent cliff\"--a fall in sales as the patents on their most popular pills expire or are struck down by legal challenges, with few new potential _ to take their place. This week the patent on the best-selling drug in history expired--Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol pill which earned Pfizer nearly $11 billion in revenues last year.In all, pill like Lipitor with a combined $170 billion in annual sales will go off-patent by the end of 2015. What is supposed to happen now is that lots of copycat firms rush in with \"generic\" (ie, chemically identical) versions of Lipitor at perhaps one-fifth of its price.Patients and health-care payers should reap the benefit.Pfizer's revenues should suffer. The same story will be repeated many times, as other best-selling drugs march over the patent cliff But generics makers may face delays getting their cheaper versions to market.Ranbaxy, a Japanese-owned drugmaker, struggled to get regulators' approval for its generic version of Lipitor, and only won it on the day the patent expired.More importantly, research-based drug firms are using a variety of tactics to make the patent cliff slope more gently. Jon Leibowitz, chairman of America's Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is concerned by drugmakers filing additional patents on their products to put off the day when their protection expires. Another tactic  is \"pay-for-delay\", in which a drugmaker facing a legal challenge to its patent pays its would-be competitor to put off introducing its cheaper copy. In the year to October the FTC identified what it believes to be 28 such settlements. American and European regulators are looking into these deals. However, legal challenges against them have been delayed, and a bill to ban them is stuck in Congress. To encourage generics makers to challenge patents on drugs, and introduce cheaper copies, an American law passed in 1984 says that the first one to do so will get a 180-day exclusivity period,in which no other generics maker can sell versions of the drug in question, as Ranbaxy supposedly won with Lipitor. However, Pfizer is exploiting a loophole  in the 1984 law, which lets it appoint a second, authorised copycat--in this case, Watson, another American firm.According to BernsteinResearch, under the deal between the two drugmakers Pfizer will receive about 70% of Watson's revenues from its approved copy of Lipitor.More unusual, Pfizer has cut the price of its original version, and will keep marketing it vigorously. So Ranbaxy faces not one, but two competitors. All this may raise Pfizer's sales by nearly $500m in the last half of 2015 compared with what they would otherwise have been, says Tim Anderson of BernsteinResearch, with revenues then falling after the 180 days are over. Others fear that Pfizer's tactics , if copied, will make the 180-day exclusivity period worth far less, and thus discourage generic firms from challenging patents in the first place.

He worked at Sandoz Laboratories where he nurtured his research work, and there he made a lot of success by working with various plants and changing them into something useful. He became famous when he became the first person to produce lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)  . In addition, he was also the first person to taste it and learn about its hallucinogenic   effects. He was deeply connected to the nature and argued that LSD, besides being useful for psychiatry , could also be used to promote awareness of mankind's place in nature. However, he was disappointed that his discovery was being carelessly used as a drug for entertainment. Because of his discovery, LSD fans have fondly called him \"The father of LSD\". Besides carrying out his scientific experiments, he also authored numerous books and more than 100 scientific articles. In 2007, he featured in a list of the 100 greatest living geniuses , published by The Telegraph Newspaper. Childhood & Early Life Albert Hofmann was born in Baden, Switzerland, on January 11, 1906.

He spent much of his childhood outdoors, and grew up with a very deep connection with nature.

The poll ( ) of nearly 150,000 people around the world found that seven of the world's 10 countries with the most upbeat attitudes are in Latin America. _ asked about 1,000 people in each of 148 countries if they were wellrested, had been treated with respect, smiled or laughed a lot, learned or did something interesting and felt feelings of enjoyment the previous day. In Panama and Paraguay, 85 percent of those polled said yes to all five, putting those countries at the top of the list. They were followed  closely  by  El Salvador,  Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Thailand, Guatemala, the Philippines, Ecuador and Costa Rica. The people least likely to report positive emotions lived in Singapore, the wealthy and orderly citystate that ranks among the most developed in the world. Other wealthy countries also sat surprisingly low on the list. Germany and France tied with the poor African state of Somaliland for 47th place. Many of the seven countries which were most positive do poorly in traditional measures of wellbeing, like Guatemala, a country torn by decades of civil war followed by waves of gangdriven criminality that give it one of the highest killing rates in the world. Guatemala sits just above Iraq on the United Nations' Human Development Index, a composite of life expectancy, education and per capital income. But it ranks seventh in positive emotions.

US parents often encourage their children to take part in all kinds of activities at school. They believe that joining in these activities can make their children mature .

They think that, for a student, staying away from schoolbooks means wasting time. This puts a lot of pressure on Chinese students, so leaders in China's education department have called for less homework at the lower grades. Only healthy kids can become healthy adults.

        "question": "When was the last time someone unexpectedly did something nice for you ? Not someone you knew, but a total stranger? It's happened to me a few times, but two instances really stand out. A few years ago, I was dining in a restaurant with a friend who kept talking about himself, completely not aware of the fact that I was sitting there in misery. It wasn't my friend's talks that made me suffer. I was recovering from a broken heart, and just sitting down to dinner reminded me of my last relationship. I could have burst into tears right there at the table. When we picked up the check, the waitress said, \" Your meal was already paid for .\" My friend and I didn't have a clue how it happened. Then I remembered a man I saw out of the corner of my eye. He was dressed in mostly white, sat down at the bar, had a beer, and stayed for maybe ten minutes. The waitress said, \"Yes, the gentleman in white paid for you .\" It felt like an angel was saying \"I see you, honey. It's going to be okay.\" Just last year, I was running a half-marathon. With just 1 mile to go, I was out of gas. Runners call it \" _ \". I thought I couldn't move another inch. Out of nowhere, a stranger came up to me and said, \"What's your name, sweetie? Jennifer? Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!\" And he ran with me until I picked up my pace. I found him at the finish line to thank him for the encouragement only to learn he wasn't even supposed to be in the race that day. I still shake my head when I think of these momentary angels that came to me at my point of need. Do you have any experiences like these? Which of the following is the best title for the passage?",

        "question": "Scratchy throats, stuffy noses and body aches all spell misery, but being able to tell if the cause is a cold or flu may make a difference in how long the misery lasts. The American Lung Association (ALA) has issued new guidelines on combating colds and the flu , and one of the keys is being able to quickly tell the two apart. That's because the prescription drugs available for the flu need to be taken soon after the illness sets in. As for colds, the sooner a person starts taking over-the-counter remedy, the sooner relief will come. The common cold and the flu are both caused by viruses. More than 200 viruses can cause cold symptoms, while the flu is caused by three viruses - flu A, B and C. There is no cure for either illness , but the flu can be prevented by the flu vaccine, which is, for most people, the best way to fight the flu, according to the ALA. But if the flu does strike, quick action can help. Although the flu and common cold have many similarities , there are some obvious signs to look for. Cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose and scratchy throat typically develop gradually, and adults and teens often do not get a fever. On the other hand, fever is one of the characteristic features of the flu for all ages. And in general, flu symptoms including fever and chills, sore throat and body aches come on suddenly and are more severe than cold symptoms. The ALA notes that it may be particularly difficult to tell when infants and preschool age children have the flu. It advises parents to call the doctor if their small children have flu-like symptoms. Both cold and flu symptoms can be eased with over-the-counter medications as well. However, children and teens with a cold or flu should not take aspirin for pain relief because of the risk of Reye syndrome  ,a rare but serious condition of the liver and central nervous system. There is, of course, no vaccine for the common cold. But frequent hand washing and avoiding close contact with people who have colds can reduce the likelihood of catching one.

The incident happened about 3pm on a cul-desac in the 1700 block of Cedar Cove Court, said Sgt. Williams of the Harris County Sheriff's Department. An investigation found that Rick James Lohstroh, 41, was shot by his son, who was sitting in the back seat of the man's Toyota 4-Runner, said Sgt. Williams. The shooting took place outside the home of Lohstroh's ex-wife, where the boy lives with his mother and a 7-year-old brother. \"We're not certain of anything until we finish our investigation,\" Williams said. \"The information we have at this time is that the 10-year-old did fire the weapon.\" The mother and the 7-year-old were inside the house when the shooting occurred, said Williams. Williams said the gun belonged to the boy's mother. After firing shots through the back seat, the boy exited the back of the vehicle and continued to fire at the car. The man died on the way to Memorial Herman Hospital. Lohstroh was a doctor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. The man and woman shared custody of the children. Williams said the mother and the boy were still in the home talking to investigators Friday night. Neighbors described the family as being quiet and keeping to themselves.

Her father is disabled, so the modest profit the two of them earn must cover food, clothing and other necessities for all seven children and their parents. Despite having precious little time to study, Rashida is one of the top students at her junior secondary school. But with so much responsibility on her small shoulders, she admits that it is sometimes hard for her to imagine a more promising future. Last year, Rashida was invited to join 155 other girls at Camfed Ghana's first Girls' Career Camp, a program designed to inspire girls growing up in the country's Northern Region to dream big, and to support them to pursue those dreams. \"We organized this camp because we wanted to let girls know that even if they are struggling with poverty, their lives will not be defined by limitations,\" says Dolores Dickson, Camfed Ghana's Executive Director. Over the course of five days, the camp led the junior and secondary school students through a range of experiences and career opportunities that were entirely new to them. Dr. Agnes Apusiga, a lecturer from the University of Development Studies, ran the workshop on goal-setting and career choices, describing the universities and training colleges in Ghana that could help them achieve their dreams. Participants then visited the University for Development Studies, where they toured the medical school and science labs. Another highlight was a workshop at the computer lab at Tamale Secondary School. Many of the girls had studied information technology from a book but had never before seen a computer. \"When the girls arrived at camp, they were not ambitious, because they didn't have any idea what the world held for them,\" says Eugenia Ayagiba, Project Officer with Camfed Ghana. \"Many had scarcely traveled beyond their own villages.\" \"I think the most important thing that happened at the camp is that we opened a window of hope for a group of girls coming from backgrounds of poverty,\" says Eugenia. For Rashida, who has been laughed at in the past by her schoolmates because of her father's disability, the experience was important. \"She told one of the camp mentors  that when she is at school, she often feels like a misfit, and she prefers to keep to herself,\" says Eugenia. \"But at the camp, it was different. She made friends with girls who have similar struggles. She took part in every single activity, every single game. On the last day, she said to her mentor, \"The camp has challenged me to study hard. Now I see that there is light at the end of the tunnel.\" How many members are there in Rashida's family?",

He was trained to be a spy  by a special CIA programme, which was made to look like a summer camp. He learned high-speed driving, hand-to-hand fighting and the use of high-tech tools. After proving he could become a young hero by saving a baby from a runaway car, Banks gets his first real task. He must make friends with a popular girl at school, Natalie Connors. Then, he must spy on her father, a scientist who has developed a dangerous technology . Banks must stop a group of bad people from forcing Natalie's father into using the technology to endanger the world.

The world's most valuable company is working with its Chinese suppliers to eventually produce 2.2 gigawatts of solar power and other renewable energy. The commitment announced Wednesday represents Apple's latest attempt to prevent the popularity of its devices and digital services from increasing the carbon emissions that are widely believed to change the Earth's climate. Apple Inc. estimates   20 million tons of greenhouse gas pollution will be avoided as more of its suppliers rely on renewable energy between now and 2020. That's like having four million fewer cars on the road for a year. Panels capable of generating   about 200 megawatts of solar power will be financed by Apple in the northern, southern and eastern regions of China, where many of its suppliers are located. The company is teaming up with its Chinese suppliers to build the capacity for the remaining 2 gigawatts of renewable energy, which will be a mix of solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Foxconn, which runs the factory where the most iPhones are assembled, is pledging to contribute 400 megawatts of solar power as part of the 2-gigawatt commitment. The solar panels to be built by 2018 in China's Henan Province are supposed to produce as much renewable energy as Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory consumes while making iPhones. Apple has made protecting the environment a higher priority since Tim Cook replaced the late Steve Jobs as the company's CEO four years ago. \"Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, and the time for action is now,\" Cook said in a statement. \"The transition to a new green economy requires innovation, ambition and purpose.\" Apple just completed projects in China that generate 40 megawatts of solar energy to cover the power required by its 24 stores and 19 offices in the country. All of Apple's data centers, offices and stores in the U.S. already have been running on renewable energy. \"When you look at all the air pollution in China, all the manufacturing that is done there has a lot to do with it, so this is a significant step in the right direction,\" said Gary Cook, a senior analyst for Greenpeace, a group devoted to protecting the environment. Apple also has a financial motivation to help make China a better place to live. The greater China region is Apple's second biggest market behind the U.S. Tim Cook has made it clear that he wants the company to make even more progress as rising incomes enable more of China's population to buy smart phones and other gadgets. Apple can easily afford to go green. The company had $203 billion in cash at the end of June. This story has been reflected to correct that Apple and its suppliers haven't set a timetable for producing the 2.2 gigawatts of renewable energy in China.

If you come to visit, you'll probably be surprised when you come in: Someone will give you an electronic PIN to wear. The PIN tells the house who you are and where you are. The house uses this information to give you what you need. When it's dark outside, the PIN turns on the lights near you, and then turns them off as you walk away from them. Music moves with you, too. If the house knows your favorite music, it plays it for you. The music seems to be everywhere, but in fact other people in the house hear different music or no music. If you get a telephone call, only the nearest telephone rings. Of course, you are also able to want something. There is a home control console   which is a small machine that turns things on and off around you. The PIN and the console are new ideas, but they are in fact like many things we have today.

Take courage!\" \"What's courage?\" she asked, running to her mother's bed. \"Courage is the brave breath,\" her mother answered. \"Mum, do you have courage?\" \"Certainly!\" The girl held out her hands, saying, \"Mum, please blow some of your courage breath to me.\" After her mother blew out two mouthfuls of breath into her little cold hands, the little girl held her hands nervously , afraid that the \"breath of courage\" would run away. Then, she walked out of her bedroom towards the bathroom with nothing to fear. Her mother said to herself, \" It will be nice if someone can blow some kind of \"breath\" to me.

        "question": "The social sciences, as the name shows, are the scientific study of the behavior of human beings, both in groups and individually. There is no past or present information of human beings who were not in groups. The groups may be small, like the family, or large, like a city or nation. But in order to reach complete development, man must be a member of a society. It is true that some individuals are more solitary than others. Some like monks or hermits may decide, for religious or other reasons, to leave their society and live alone. But these are unusual individuals, and even they cannot separate themselves completely from the rest of mankind. A society, then, seems to be the natural environment of mankind. Scholars who study mankind in social organizations are called social scientists.  The human behavior which social scientists study is learned behavior. The behavior of the human body as a living organism is studied by the biologist, the biochemist, or the physician. This behavior of man's physical body is inherited through the genetic development of his species. For example, all physically normal and healthy humans learn to walk as their bodies grow and develop. Social scientists concern themselves with the behavior that man must learn so that he can take his place in a social group. In order to be a functioning member of that group, each member must learn to behave in a way acceptable according to the differences among societies. The social scientists are newcomers to academic studies. By the end of the 19th century, the natural sciences had developed a method, by which they were able to understand the physical world. By using the scientific method, chemists, physicists, and astronauts, for example, learned a great deal about the universe. It seemed reasonable to apply the same method to the study of man's social life. Through this kind of study man may learn to understand himself much better. The scientific method is a way of collecting facts in order to describe an existing situation as correctly and completely as possible. The description must consist only of what can be perceived , analyzed, measured and recorded. Feelings and personal opinions or ideas have no place in scientific description. The fact must be observed and described in such a way that another scientist could repeat the same study and get the same results. How does a social behavior differ from physical behavior?",

        "question": "Music for Little Mozarts is a programme designed to help your little ones develop a love of music. Learning music at an early age helps develop minds and expand cognitive   ability. While listening to music can certainly help your youngster pick up songs, actually learning to play the piano can help your child's development. This programme focuses on little creatures that both entertain and teach. By grasping the attention of a young child's mind and engaging them with stories along with hands on experience, you can provide them with a positive experience that may produce a little Mozart in later years. Within this multi-book and multi-year lesson plan there are ten little characters that help draw the child into the lesson plan. These little creatures actually can be used to help the child grasp basic concepts in music. The series starts out in the preschool years and provides day by day lessons that can aid the child or a classroom of children right through early adolescence  . The series is designed for both classroom and preschool use and for those at home with homeschoolers. It contains a series of books along with audio CD's, flash cards, and other visual aids that can help very young children develop an ear and an eye for music. It can be hard to hold the attention spans of children for very long. However, with the right creativity and the proper attention along with simple, easy to master daily lessons, most children will not only grasp music rather quickly, they will also develop a love of real music, not just banging on a piano keyboard and making sounds. The short, daily lessons are planned out so that children learn to play music by ear. They learn to play real songs and master real passages quickly and easily. This element keeps them involved. They also master playing by ear and then later by reading rather quickly. We can infer that this programme was developed for_.",

Some students' mobile phones are stolen, some students fight with and hurt one another, and others are knocked down by the fast running bikes or cars. These problems arc common on campus. I think there are three causes for these. Firstly, some students do not take good care of their properties. They are still young and not careful enough. Secondly, some students want to do everything well. They want to be the winners in exams, and they also want to be the winners in fightings.  And thirdly, the campus guards do not carry on their duties well. They don' t regulate the traffic in the busy hour. In order to have a secure campus, all the students should be very careful about their properties. They should also mind their behaviors  and act politely. The campus guards are supposed to be devoted  to the security on campus, and it is their duty to safeguard  a secure campus to help provide a good environment for the students.

There was nothing to be done but to find another hotel. The waiters were happy to find me a new hotel , and when I said that I was happy to stay at the airport , thinking it might be cheaper than staying in the city , they suggested the Holiday Inn at the airport . There was one small matter : the room rate was $ 300 per night . The best hotel in Katoomba had wanted only $ 145 . I asked if there was anything cheaper they might suggest but they warned that most hotels would already be full by this time. The hotel was far from the train station , so I had to take a taxi , at $ 25 . On the way to the Holiday Inn , we passed a hotel just two blocks from the Holiday Inn that advertised a room rate of $ 104 . At the desk I asked if their room rate could go down a lot . \" No , this is a 4-star hotel,\" the waiter told me . \" In that case ,\" I replied , \" I'll just walk the two blocks to the cheap hotel.\" But she warned me that they were probably full and that if I didn't take the room , it might not be available when I came back . Finally , I decided to take the room. The room itself was big , but the air conditioning couldn't keep up with the Australian heat . I couldn't sleep until about 1:00 am.

The event was swimming and started with only three men on the blocks. For one reason or another, two of them false started, so they were disqualified. That left only one to compete. It would have been difficult enough, not having anyone to race against, even though the time on the clock is important. I watched the man dive off the block and knew right away that something was wrong. I'm not an expert swimmer, but I can tell a good dive from a poor one, and this was not exactly medal quality. When he resurfaced, it was evident that the man was not out for gold - his arms were waving in an attempt at freestyle. The crowd started to laugh. Clearly this man was not a medal competitor. I listened to the crowd begin to laugh at this poor man who was clearly having a hard time. Finally he made his turn to start back. It was pitiful. He made a few desperate strokes and you could tell he was worn out. But in those few awful strokes, the crowd had changed. No longer were they laughing, but beginning to cheer. Some even began to stand and shout \"Come on, you can do it!\" and he did. A clear minute past the average swimmer, this young man finally finished his race. The crowd went wild. You would have thought that he had won the gold, and he should have. Even though he recorded one of the slowest times in Olympic history, this man gave more heart than any of the other competitors.

The social connections may help in the future.\" The latest report from the US-based institute of International Education said China, for the first time, has become the top country of origin for international students in the United States. For Yang Fan, a journalism student, said studying in the United States is a way to escape the competition for places in China's top universities. \"Due to limited education resources, only about 60 percent of high school graduates in China enter college, and a much lower rate enters the top-level ones. \"A foreign degree will definitely help when I seek a job in China,\" Yang said. Both Yang's and Luo's parents are supportive of them studying abroad. Neither of them is thinking of settling down in the United States after graduation. \"It is not realistic to do so. As a journalism student, there would be no advantage for me to work in the United States,\" Yang said. \"But in China, with a US degree and good English, I may stand out against other students who have only studied in China.\" China still needs to improve its environment for scientists and high-level talents, said Xiao Mingzheng, director of the Center for Human Resource Development and Management Research of Peking University, adding that, in particular, the country needs to improve its policies relating to research environments.

You almost certainly own a car and possibly a home computer, holiday abroad at least once a year and eat out at least once a week.

        "question": "Most children don't enjoy doing housework . Then like playing computer games rather than  cleaning the rooms. But in Australia, Jim and Robert's mother, Mrs Black, has a good and proper method to get their children to do housework. Here is an example.    \"Mum, have you worked out next week's housework? Let Jim and me choose the cards. I can't wait. It's fun! \"    When Robert shouted out, his mother had already put all the cards on their big table. On the  cards, there are some words like these, \" sweep the floor, clean your bedroom, help mum cook,  wash vegetables, make beds, feed the fish, cut the wood, clean the bathroom \" and many others. Jim and Robert chose two cards for each day from Monday to Friday. Then they would hang  them on the weekday task board. Jim likes to clean the bathroom, so he picked up the card \"clean  the bathroom \". Robert loves to make the bed so he picked up his favorite card. Jim again picked  up \"wash vegetables\" and Robert chose \" feed the fish \". Soon the two boys were happy to take  away all the cards.  To help the children do housework, their mother thought hard and came up with this idea. Of  course, the couple did the housework on the weekends and left Jim and Robert two days free.

In West America, cowboys   had to take care of the cattle. They had to watch them all day and all night because the cattle sometimes ran away. A cowboy's life was lonely and dangerous. When he was alone in the desert   with the cattle, he drank strong coffee to stay awake at night. He sang about the stars and the moon, about his family and his friends. The cattle listened to the cowboy and went to sleep. They didn't run away if he sang beautiful songs. In South America, many people came from Ireland and England. Other people came from France and Canada. They enjoyed their own kind of music. When they visited their friends and families on holidays like Christmas, they usually sang and played country music.

        "question": "An allowance  is an important tool for teaching kids how to make plans for the use of money, save and make their own decisions. Children remember and learn from mistakes when their own dollars are lost or spent foolishly. How large an allowance is suitable? Experts say there is not right amount. Actual amounts differ from region to region, and from family to family. To set an suitable allowance for your child, work up a weekly plan. Allow for entertainment costs such as movies and snacks. Next, include everyday expenses such as lunch money, bus fare, school supplies. \"If you make the child responsible for these bills',\" says Josephine Swanson, a consumer specialist, \" he or she will learn to plan for necessary costs.\" Finally, add some extra money to make saving possible. If you can keep your child's allowance in line with that of his friends. A child whose buying power falls away below his peers' can feel left out. It can be tough, but don't excuse your children when they make a mistake with their allowance. When Brooke Stephens was ten and growing up in Jacksonville, her mother gave her $5 a week, $1.75 of which was for bus fare and lunch.\" If you lose your money,\" Brooke's mother told her, \"you walk home.\" One week the girl spent all her allowance in a candy store, then she called home for a ride. \" Mom made me walk home,\" recalls Stephens, now a financial planner in Brooklyn. \" At first I was angry. But I finally realized that she was trying to teach me an important lesson. \" Experts advise that an allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily housework at home. Kids should help around the house not because they get paid for it but because they share responsibilities as members of a family. You might, however, pay a child for doing extra jobs at home, which can develop his or her early habits. Why does the writer mention Brooke Stephens?",

After 90 minutes of play, bridge players had increased level of immune  cell, according to research reported last week.  A researcher, Diamond, studies bridge players from a woman's bridge club. She chose bridge players because the game includes skills stimulating  a part of the brain called the dorsolateral cortex. Earlier animal research suggests that this part of the brain may play a role in the immune system. The findings are based on blood samples drawn from 12 women players. Their blood samples showed a rise in levels of white blood cells called T cells after they played bridge for 90 minutes. T cells are produced by the thymus gland  and used by the immune system against diseases. The T cells count jumped significantly in eight of the bridge players, and slightly in the other four.  The findings contribute to the field of neuroimmunology , whose name reflects the fact that the nervous system and the immune system are not considered separate and isolated systems. What isn't clear is whether the help to the immune system from an activity like contract bridge is lasting or temporary. It's also not clear whether the increase in T cells could finally be targeted against special illness. Diamond chose to study bridge players for the research because   _  .",

I just couldn't imagine why she had made her parents so angry. It seemed that Katie had been running up sizable charges in the lunchroom. Her parents explained that Katie brought a great homemade lunch each day, and there was no reason for her to buy school lunch. They assumed a sit-down with Katie would solve the problem, but failed. So they asked me to help them get to the bottom of this situation. So the next day, I asked Katie to my office. \"Why are you charging lunches, Katie? What happened to your homemade lunch?\" I asked. \"I lose it,\" she responded. I leaned back in my chair and said, \"I don't believe you, Katie. \" She didn't care. \"Is someone stealing your lunch, Katie?\" I took a new track. \"No. I just lose it,\" she said.

I thought I would go and sit with him for a while. As I walked towards him, I noticed the lunch bag on the table. The name on the bag said \"Katie\". Now I understood and I talked to Katie. It seemed that the new boy never brought a lunch, and he wouldn't go to the lunch line for a free lunch. He had told Katie his secret and asked her not to tell anyone that his parents wanted him to get a free lunch at school. Katie asked me not to tell her parents, but I drove to her house that evening after I was sure that she was in bed. I had never seen parents so proud of their child. Katie didn't care that her parents and teacher were disappointed in her. But she cared about a little boy who was hungry and scared. Katie still buys lunch every day at school.

Sometimes I studied for weeks before a test. Yet I would go in to take the test, only to find I could not answer the questions correctly. I would blank out because of nervousness and fear. I couldn't think of the answer. My low grades on the tests did not show what I knew to the teacher. \"Another student in biology had similar experiences. He said, \"My first chemistry test was very difficult. Then, on the second test, I sat down to take it, and I was so nervous that I was shaking. My hands were moving up and down so quickly that it was hard to hold my pencil. I knew the material and I knew the answers. Yet I couldn't even write them down!\" These two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the extreme tension and nervousness. Contrary to people's common belief that poor grades are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety plays a role in students' achieving low grades. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students. Special university advising courses try to help students. In these courses, advisors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the tests show their anxiety is high, the students can take short courses to help them deal with their tensions. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. Students are trained to become calm in very tense situations. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease. Learned information then comes out without difficulty on a test. An expert at the University of California explains, \" With almost all students, relaxation and less stress are felt after taking our program. Most of them experience better control during their tests. Almost all have some improvement. With some, the improvement is very great. \" To \"blank out\" is probably  _  .",

        "question": "Some wonderfully creative uses of X-rays have been in the world of art.But the most impressive one is to uncover what has been covered up.Details unfolded by an X-ray of a painting can ' t be seen any other way.For example, in the past, paintings were often repaired if small pieces of paint fell off the canvas  . These repairs cannot be seen just by looking at the painting.It takes an X-ray to discover where the repairs have been made. An X-ray of a painting is one of the best ways to tell if it was created by a famous painter or if it is a forgery .If there is a question as to whether an old master has painted a certain painting or not, X-rays are made and compared to those of paintings that are known to be original.If the brushstrokes   , for example, are shown to be totally different than in other work done by a certain artist, then the painting is proved to be a fake copy. Since modern paints are usually made from different materials than paints of hundreds of years ago, the image they leave on an X-ray film looks different.This is another way X-rays can be used to spot a forgery.A modem artist will try to make a forgery look hundreds of years old by painting dirty varnish on it or by using artificial means to get the varnish to look cracked.To the naked eye the forgery may look old, but when a careful study of the X-ray image is made, the _ is obvious. It was common many years ago for an artist to finish a painting, decide it wasn't any good, and paint a completely different picture on top of it.Or artists would paint over others' work --it was their version of recycling.Taking an X-ray is the only way to find out if there is a picture underneath the picture you see with your eyes.Sometimes museums will be more interested in the painting beneath than the one on top, and will restore the older one by having the top layer painstakingly removed.

        "question": "As they migrate, butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops. What's the main idea of the text?",

        "question": "Blameless I was a freshman in college when I met the Whites. They were completely different from my own family, yet I felt at home with them immediately. Jane White and I became friends at school, and her family welcomed me like a long-lost cousin. In my family, it was always important to place blame when anything bad happened. \"Who did this? \"my mother would scream about a dirty kitchen. \"This is all your fault, Katharine, \"my father would insist when the cat got out or the dishwasher broke. From the time we were little, my sister, brothers and I told on each other. We set a place for blame at the dinner table. But the Whites didn't worry about who had done what. They picked up the pieces and moved on with their lives. The beauty of this was driven home to me the summer Jane died. In July, the White sisters and I decided to take a car trip from their home in Florida to New York. The two older sisters, Sarah and Jane, were college students, and the youngest, Amy, had recently turned sixteen. Proud of having a new driver's license ,Amy was excited about practicing her driving on the trip. She showed off her license to everyone she met. The big sisters shared the driving of Sarah's new car during the first part of the trip, but when they reached less crowded areas, they let Amy take over. Somewhere in South Carolina, we pulled off the highway to eat. After lunch, Amy got behind the wheel. She came to a crossroads with a stop sign. Whether she was nervous or just didn't see the sign no one would ever know, but Amy continued into the crossroads without stopping. The driver of a large truck, unable to stop in time, ran into our car. Jane was killed immediately. I was slightly injured. The most difficult thing that I've ever done was to call the Whites to tell them about the accident and that Jane had died. Painful as it was for me to lose a good friend, I knew that it was far worse for them to lose a child. When Mr. and Mrs. White arrived at the hospital, they found their two daughters sharing a room. Sarah had a few cuts on the head; Amy's leg was broken. They hugged us all and cried tears of sadness and of joy at seeing their daughters. They wiped away the girls' tears and made a few jokes at Amy as she learned to use her crutches . To both of their daughters, and especially to Amy, over and over they simply said, \"We're so glad that you're alive. \" I was astonished. No blame. No accusations. Later, I asked the Whites why they never talked about the fact that Amy was driving and had run a stop sign. Mrs. White said, \"Jane's gone, and we miss her terribly. Nothing we say or do will ever bring her back. But Amy has her whole life ahead of her. How can she lead a full and happy life if she feels we blame her for her sister's death? \" They were right. Amy graduated from the University of California and got married several years ago. She works as a teacher of learning-disabled students. She's also a mother of two little girls of her own, the oldest named Jane. From the passage we can learn that   _  .",

Co-discoverer Andrew Warren is hoping to raise at least $50,000 by auctioning  off the rights to name the 4-inch \"owl eye\" butterfly, which lives in Sonora, a Mexican state bordering Arizona. \"That would support at least two years of research for our team down in Mexico,\" Warren said. \"Money goes a long way down here in Mexico.\" According to the scientific tradition, discoverers of a new species have the say in naming it. In recent years, some discoverers have auctioned off their naming rights to raise money. Warren said the amount being sought for the butterfly is not out of the question, noting that naming rights for a new monkey species brought in $650,000 two years ago. A group of 10 new fish species that went on the naming auction block at the same time earlier this year brought in a total of $2 million. The butterfly discovered by Warren and researcher George Austin ranges as far north as Mexico. The butterfly was actually in a collection, misidentified as an example of another new species, at the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity at the Florida Museum of National History in Gainesville, said Warren. They soon began the hard process of determining that it was indeed a \"new\" model of butterfly. After checking photos and comparing it with other known species, they determined it was a separate species. Where did the researchers discover the new species of butterflies?",

        "question": "A new study gives us the warning that about thirty percent of the world's people may not have enough water by the year 2025. A private American organization called Population Action International did the new study. It says more than three-hundred-thirty-five-million people lack enough water now. The people live in twenty-eight countries. Most of the countries are in Africa or the Middle East. P-A-I researcher Robert Engelman says by the year 2025, about three-thousand-million people may lack water. At least 18 more countries are expected to have severe water problems. The demand for water keeps increasing. Yet the amount of water on Earth stays the same. Mr. Engelman says the population in countries that lack water is growing faster than in other parts of the world. He says population growth in these countries will continue to increase. The report says lack of water in the future may result in several problems. It may increase health problems. Lack of water often means drinking waters not safe. Mr. Engelman says there are problems all over the world because of diseases, such as cholera, which are carried in water. Lack of water may also result in more international conflict. Countries may have to compete for water in the future. Some countries now get sixty percent of their fresh water from other countries. This is true of Egypt, the Netherlands, Cambodia, Syria, Sudan, and Iraq. And the report says lack of water would affect the ability of developing to improve their economies. This is because new industries often need a large amount of water when they are beginning. The Population Action International study gives several solutions to the water problem. One way, it says, is to find ways to use water for more than one purpose. Another way is to teach people to be careful not to waste water. A third way is to use less water of agriculture. The report also says long-term solutions to the water problem must include controls on population growth. It says countries cannot provide clean water unless they slow population growth by limiting the number of children people have. It can be inferred that   _  .",

This is _ in an international treaty called the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972. How does a place become a World Heritage Site? It takes a lot of people to decide. 1)If a country wants one of its places to be on the World Heritage List, it has to ask UNESCO. The place must be important and special. UNESCO put the Great Wall on the list in 1987 because, it said, it was a great part of Chinese culture and beautifully made to go with the land. When a country asks, it must also make a plan for taking care of the place. 2)The World Heritage Committee of UNESCO talks about different places and decides whether to put them on the list. The committee meets every June. Many experts help the committee to decide. 3)After a new place goes on the list, UNESCO gives money to help keep it looking good. If a place is in serious danger, it may be put on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. UNESCO gives special care and help to those places. 4)Countries have to give UNESCO regular reports about places on the list.

If you really want to acquire a companion, think in advance whether you are able to handle it. Depending on what pet bird you are going to have and how big it is, the cost is different. For example, the cost of a comfortable cage, the cost for nutritional food and the money for some additional things should be taken into consideration. There are also some unexpected cost. For example, when your pet bird gets sick, you have to send for a vet  . You may think that you do not have free time to have a dog so you'd better have a pet bird because it doesn't require a lot of attention. You are wrong! Some people even do not have time for a short sleep. They will not have enough time for pets, either. For good bird health it is very important to handle them and play with them as much as you can. Also there are a lot of people who think that birds do not require a lot of space and they are wrong again. They also need to fly so if you do not have space for it, you'd better reconsider the things.  But do not forget the great advantage of having a pet bird. In the animal kingdom, birds rank near the top when it comes to smarts. You can have a friend for life if you take good care of it. It's a real character and can bring joy and colour in your home.

        "question": "A few years ago it was popular to speak of a generation gap, a disagreement between young people and their elders.Parents said that children did not show them proper respect and obedience , while children complained that their parents did not understand them at all.What had gone wrong? Why had the generation gap suddenly appeared? Actually the generation gap has been _ for a long time.Many people argue that a gap is built into the fabric of our society. One important cause of the generation gap is the chance that young people have to choose their own ways of life.In more traditional societies, when children grow up, they are expected to live in the same area as their parents, to marry people that their parents know and agree to, and to continue the family occupation .In our society, young people often travel great distances for their education, move out of the family home at an early age, marry or live with people whom their parents have never met, and choose occupations different from those of their parents. In our easily changing society, parents often expect their children to do better than they did: to find better jobs, to make more money, and to do all the things that they were unable to do.Often, however, the strong desire that parents have for their children are another cause of the disagreement between them.Often, they discover that they have very little in common with each other. Finally, the speed at which changes take place in our society is another cause of the gap between the generations.In a traditional culture, elderly people are valued for their wisdom, but in our society the knowledge of a lifetime may become out of date overnight.The young and the old seem to live in two very different worlds, separated by different skills and abilities. No doubt, the generation gap will continue to be a feature of American life for some time to come.Its causes are rooted in the freedom and changes of our society, and in the rapid speed at which society changes.

        "question": "Ceaseless technology. A punishing workweek. That to -do list that keeps multiplying. It is no wonder many of us find it difficult to have a sufficient amount of sleep. But will sleeping more on the weekend make up for hours of lost snoozing  ? One sleep expert, W. Christopher Winter raised the question. Sleeping binge Getting eight hours of shut-eye each night is generally recommended, but many people don't. As the week rolls from Monday to Friday, they accumulate a sleep debt. Spending a few extra hours in bed on a Saturday morning, people assume, will help them \" catch up\" on lost sleep. They're likely right, \" Nobody knows how long the horizon is, probably a few nights, but studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work,\" says Dr. Winter, a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Sleep banking Recent data suggests that banking sleep in advance of a long night can actually offset   upcoming sleep deprivation . If you knew you were going to have to stay up all night on a particular day, for example, you could sleep for 10 hours a day for multiple days before the event, and be fine, Dr. Winter says. Just plan ahead. Routine  naps A scheduled nap is healthier than catching up on or banking sleep. \" Because sleep extension can make you feel groggy  , I always recommend a short nap [if a person feels they need it ], at the same time, every day,\" says Dr. Winter. He adds that 25 minutes is ideal. \" When you schedule a short nap, your body anticipates it and slows down, without falling into a deep dream sleep,\" he says. That refreshing, scheduled break is better than an occasional weekend lie-in. \" The body likes routine,\" he says, \" When it's prepared, it works more efficiently.\" What would be the best title for the passage?",

His mother's ancestors were early settlers in Texas, and over the generations had acquired a 25,000 acre farm at Cotulla. Jeffrey spent most summers of his youth working with his grandfather on their farm. Jeffrey showed intense and varied scientific interests at an early age. He set up an electric alarm to keep his younger sisters and brothers out of his room and changed his parents' garage into a laboratory for his science projects. After he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering, Jeffrey Bezos found employment on Wall Street, where computer science was increasingly in demand to study market trends. He rose quickly, becoming a senior vice president, and looked forward to a bright career in finance, when he made a discovery that changed his life, and the course of business history. In 1994, there was still no Internet commerce to speak of. One day that spring, Jeffrey Bezos observed that Internet usage was increasing by 2,300 percent a year. He saw an opportunity for a new circle of commerce, and immediately began considering the possibilities. Bezos founded Amazon. com in 1994, setting up the original company in his garage. The company was called Amazon for the seemingly endless South American river with its numberless branches. It started as an online bookstore but soon diversified to all kinds of products. His work with Amazon eventually led him to become one of the most excellent dot-com entrepreneurs. He was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 1999. In 2008, he was selected by U. S. News & World Report as one of America's Best Leaders. Bezos's Amazon has become  \"the Earth's biggest anything store\". Amazon. com is now called \"one of the smartest strategies in business history.

We certainly act as if they don't.Most chefs cook lobsters and crabs alive, usually by dumping them in boiling water.Along with melted butter.That's the appeal of crustaceans-there's no fresher food.We may feel a bit of guilt, or maybe just discomfort, when we hear the creatures rattling   around the inside of the pot as the water boils.But that feeling usually  _ for lobster lovers by the time we crack open a claw and dig out the delicious meat.We wouldn't dream of doing the same thing to a live chicken or pig which are dead well before die cooking process begins, but those crustaceans are different.They don't even feel pain.Right? Actually, they just might.That's the conclusion of a new study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.Robert Elwood and Barry Magee of Queen's University in Belfast examined the reaction of common shore crabs to small electrical shocks. Ninety crabs were placed in a brightly lit area and were given the choice of moving to one of two dark shelters.(Shore crabs like to hide in dark, tight spaces.) Once they'd made their choice, the crabs in one of the shelters were exposed to an electric shock.After a rest period, the crabs were returned to the lit tank.Most of the crabs went back into the dark shelters, and then the same crabs were given another electric shock.When they were placed back into the lit tank for the third time, the majority of the shocked crabs instead went to the other dark shelter, avoiding the one where they had repeatedly been shocked. As Elwood put it, the crabs' choice indicated they wanted to escape the shocks: Having experienced two rounds of shocks, the crabs learned to avoid the shelter where they received the shock. They were willing to give up their hideaway in order to avoid the source of their probable pain. According to the author, people cook the crab alive due to the belief that  _  .",

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates delivered the commencement   address at Harvard University on Thursday, and was awarded the L. L.

He was named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004, 2005, 2006 and again in 2007, \" said Harvard's president, Derek Bok. Then Bok spoke more directly to Gates: \"Just think what you could have achieved if you had stayed another two years.\" Gates told the students, many of whom will soon be launching into full-time careers, that work isn't the only thing of importance. \"Judge yourself not on the professional accomplishments but on how well you have addressed the world's inequities, how you have treated people who have nothing to do with you,\" he said. In recent months, Gates has been giving a larger part of his time and energy to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which focuses on issues including global health and education. In 2008, he plans to make the foundation his chief responsibility. But for the most part, the Microsoft co-founder stuck to the serious message about trying to make the world a better place. He urged the graduates not to get discouraged about seemingly intractable   challenges of poverty and poor health. As many as 30,000 people were expected to attend the outdoor commencement ceremony.

Sleep debt is the difference between the amount of sleep you should be getting and the amount you actually get.It's a deficit that grows every time we skim some extra minutes off our nightly sleep.\"People accumulate sleep debt gradually without being noticed,\"says William C.Dement,founder of the Stanford University Sleep Clinic.Studies show that such short--term sleep deprivation leads to a foggy brain,worsened vision,and trouble remembering. Long-term effects include obesity,insulin resistance, and heart disease. A survey by the National Sleep Foundation reports that we're losing one hour of sleep each night----more than two full weeks of sleep every year. The good news is that,like all debt, with some work,sleep debt can be repaid. Adding an extra hour or two of sleep a night is the way to catch up.For the long--term lack of sleep,take it easy for a few months to get back into a natural sleep pattern. Go to bed when you are tired,and allow your body to wake you in the morning(no alarm clock allowed).You may find yourself catatonic in the beginning of the recovery cycle:expect to have ten hours shut-eye per night. As the days pass, however,the amount of sleeping time will gradually decrease. So earn back that lost sleep----and follow the dictates of your innate sleep needs. You'll feel better.\"When you put away sleep debt, you become a superman,\"says Stanford's Dement, talking about the improved mental and physical capabilities that come with being well rested.

Although he played for the school's golf team, he lost the only important match of the season. Sparky was a loser. He, his classmates...everyone knew it. Sparky never asked a classmate to go out in high school. He was too afraid of being refused. However, one thing was important to Sparky - drawing. He was proud of his artwork. Of course, no one else appreciated it. In his senior year of high school, he sent some cartoons to the editors of the Yearbook. Although the cartoons were turned down, Sparky was so confident about his ability that he decided to become an artist. After completing high school, he wrote a letter to Walt Disney Studios. He was told to send some samples of his artwork, and the subject for a cartoon was suggested. Sparky spent a great deal of time on it. Finally, the reply came from Disney Studios. He had been rejected once again. Another loss for the loser. So Sparky decided to write his own autobiography in cartoons. He described his childhood - a little boy loser and underachiever. The cartoon character would soon become famous worldwide. For Sparky, the boy who had little success in school and whose work was rejected again and again was Charles Schulz. He created the Peanuts comic strip and little cartoon character - Charlie Brown. What's Sparky's success according to the passage?",

For years a nearby villager named Germain has been Ponso's only company,visiting him so often to bring bananas and bread--the chimp's only source of food on the tiny island.It was clear how much Ponso missed companionship when he was recently visited by Chimpanzee Conservation Centre Director Estelle Raballand.The chimp immediately embraced Estelle Raballand in a huge hug and laughed as she reached out for him,with his smile from ear to ear. For those who know Ponso's backstory,his immediate ease and trust in humans might be surprising.Ponso was one of 20 chimps,all between the ages of 7 to 11 years old,relocated to an island off the Ivory Coast after being used for testing by the New York Blood Centre.After the tests were completed in 2005,the lab reportedly transferred the chimps to a string of islands,occasionally dropping off food and water because there was none in the chimps' new homes. Disease and hunger soon left only Ponso,his mate and their two children standing.But at the end of 2013 they died within days of each other and Ponso was now completely alone. A group called SOS PONSO is trying to raise money for the poor lonely chimp,already achieving its goal of $20,000--all of which will be used for Ponso's care. What do we know about the chimp Ponso?",

        "question": "Sports is not only physically challenging, but it can also mentally challenging. Criticism from coaches(trainers), parents, and other teammates, as well as pressure to win can create too much anxiety or stress for young athletes. Stress can be physical, emotional, or psychological, and research has showed that it can lead to burnout. Burnout has been described as dropping or quitting of an activity that was at one time enjoyable. The early years of development are critical years for learning about oneself. The sport setting is one where valuable experiences can take place. Young athletes can, for example, learn how to cooperate with others, make friends, and gain other social skills that will be used throughout their lives. Coaches and parents should be aware(realize), at all times, that their feedback to youngsters can greatly affect their children. Youngsters may take their parents' and coaches' criticisms to heart and find a flaw  in themselves. Coaches and parents should also be cautious(careful) that youth sport participation does not become work for children. The outcome of the game should not be more important than the process of learning the sport and other life lessons. In today's youth sport setting, young athletes may be worrying more about who will win instead of enjoying themselves and the sport. Following a game, many parents and coaches focus on(pay more attention to) the outcome and find fault with youngsters' performances. Positive reinforcement should be provided in spite of the outcome. Research shows that positive reinforcement motivates and has a greater effect on learning than criticism. Again, criticism can create high levels of stress(pressure), which can lead to burnout.

Perhaps your family and friends said similar things to you when you left home. But does it seem true all the time? Is your life in this new country always wonderful and exciting? A great many facts show that it's not easy for newcomers to adjust to life in a new culture. They have to experience culture shock. What causes culture shock? Maybe the weather is unpleasant. Perhaps the customs are different. Perhaps the public service systems such as the telephone, post office, or transportation are difficult to figure out and you make mistakes. The simplest things seem difficult. The language may be difficult. The food may seem strange to you. If you don't look similar to the natives, you may feel strange. You may feel as if everyone is watching you. In fact, you are always watching yourself. Everyone experiences culture shock in some form or another. But culture shock comes as a surprise to most people. A lot of the time, the people with the worst culture shock are the people who never had any difficulties in their own countries. They were active and successful in their community. They had hobbies or pastimes which they enjoyed. When they come to a new country, they do not have the same positions or hobbies as they already had in their countries. They find themselves without a role, almost without an identity. They have to build a new self-image. Culture shock produces a feeling of disorientation , which may be homesickness, imagined illness, or even paranoia . When people feel the disorientation of culture shock, they sometimes feel like staying inside all the time. They want to protect themselves from the unfamiliar environment. They want to create an escape within their room to give themselves a sense of security. This escape does solve the problem of culture shock for the short term, but it does nothing to familiarize the person more with the culture. Familiarity and experience are the long-term ways to settle the problem of culture shock. Which of the following may cause newcomers to lack a sense of security?",

Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. With his first wife and two children he left Vermont by covered wagon in 1855 to homestead in Kansas. Perhaps he did not find farming to his liking, or perhaps he was lured  by rumors of fortunes to be made in Colorado mines. At any rate, a few years later he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\" he said. As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco.It was his custom to \"grubstake\" prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or \"grub\", while they looked for ore , in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value. Finally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \"grub\". Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took $17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \"Pittsburgh Mine,\" made $1,300,000 for Tabor in return for his $17 investment. Later Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for $117,000. This turned out to be even more unbelievable than the Pittsburgh, yielding $35,000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew. Tabor became its first mayor, and later became lieutenant  governor of the state. The underlying reason for Tabor's life career is   _  .",

        "question": "When companies do business overseas, they come in contact with people from different cultures.These individuals often speak a different language and have their own particular custom and manners.These differences can create problems.        For example, in France, business meetings begin promptly   at the designated time and everyone is expected to be there.Foreign business people who are late are often left outside to cool their heels as a means of letting them know the importance of promptness.Unless one is aware of such expected behaviors, he may end up insulting the people with whom he hopes to establish trade relations.        A second traditional problem is that of monetary conversions .For example, if a business deal is conducted with Russia, payment may be made in rubles.Of course, this currency is of little value to the American firm.It is, therefore, necessary to convert the foreign currency to American dollars.How much are these Russian rubles worth in terms of dollars? This conversion rate is determined by every market, where the currencies of countries are bought and sold.Thus there is an established rate.although it will often change from day to day.For example, the ruble may be worth 0.75 on Monday and 0.72 on Tuesday because of an announced wheat shortage in Russia.In addition, there is the dilemma associated with converting at 0.72.Some financial institutions may be unwilling to pay this price, feeling that the ruble will sink much lower over the next week.As a result, conversion may finally come at 0.69.These \"losses\" must be accepted by the company as one of the costs of doing business overseas.        A third unique problem is trade barriers.For one reason or another, all countries impose trade barriers on certain goods crossing their borders.Some trade barriers are directly related to exports.For example, the United States permits strategic military material to be shipped abroad only after government permission has been obtained.Most trade barriers, however, are designed to restrict import.Two of the most common import barriers are quotas   and tariffs  .

        "question": "Everybody hates rats. But in the earthquake places of the world - Japan, Los Angeles, Turkey - rats will soon be man's new best friends. What happens after an earthquake? We send in rescue  dogs. Why? Because they can smell people. Dogs save lives. They help rescuers to find living people. But dogs are big and they can't get into small spaces. So now a new research project is using a smaller animal to save lives: the rat. How does it work? First, the rat is trained to smell people. When this happens, the rat's brain gives a signal. This is sent to a small radio on its back, and then the rescuers follow the radio signals. When the rat's brain activity jumps, the rescuers know that someone is alive. The rat has smelled that person. Although there are already robots which can do this job, rats are better. Christian Linster at Cornell University, New York, says, \" 'Robot' noses don't work well when there are other smells around. Rats are good at that.\" Rats can also see in the dark. They are cheaper and quicker to train than dogs, and unlike robots, they don't need electricity. The \" rat project\" is not finished, but Julie Ryan of International Rescue Corps in Scotland says, \" It would be fantastic. A rat would get into spaces we couldn't get to and a rat would get out if it wasn't safe.\" Perhaps for the first time in history, people will be happy to see a rat in a building ( but only after an earthquake, of course.)

        "question": "The Elysee Palace in France enjoys equal popularity in the world with the Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom, the Kremlin in Russia as well as the White House in the U. S. It is the residence of the president of the French Republic and the symbol of the supreme authority in France. The Elysee palace, with an area of 11,000 square metres, is at the eastern end of the Champs Elysee in the city of Paris proper and backed by a large and peaceful garden of more than twenty thousand square metres. Its main building, quite handsome and graceful, is a two-story classical stone architecture of European style, and beside it are two side buildings facing each other and with an extensive rectangular courtyard in the middle. There are altogether 369 halls and rooms of different sizes. The Elysee Palace, built in 1718, has a ling history of close to300 years to date. This house was at first a private residence of a count named d'Evreau, so it was called Hotel d'Evreau. It had later gone through many changes and its owners had been changed for many times, but all the residents in it were distinguished persons and high officials. The house was renamed Bonaparte Mansion when it was owned by Louis X V and Louis X VI successively when they acted as emperors. Napoleon I signed his act of abdication here when he had suffered defeat in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Nopoleon III moved in the   Mansion in 1848 when he was elected president, and the house became a Royal Palace when he declared himself as emperor. The Third French Republic issued a decree in 1873, appointing officially the Elysee Palace as the residence president of the French Republic. Over the hundred years since then, almost all the president of the French Republic worked and lived there. Starting from 1989, the Elysee Palace is open to the public every year in September on the French Castles Day. What's the purpose of the passage?",

        "question": "Are you reading this while sitting in an office cubicle ? If so, please take a moment and glance around you. Are there photos of your last vacation hung on the wall? One of your kid's drawings? A yellowed print of a favorite cartoon? If so, you are doing something good for both yourself and your organization. Newly published research suggests working in an environment that offers little privacy can lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout . But personalizing one's workplace is an effective protection against such unwanted outcomes. \"Individuals may take comfort from the items with which they surround themselves at work, and these items may help employees to keep emotional energy high in the face of stresses that come from their work,\" writes a research team led by Gregory Laurence of the University of Michigan-Flint, Michigan, in north central U.S. In the Journal of Environmental Psychology, Laurence and his colleagues describe a study featuring 87 white-collar employees at a large, urban university in the Midwestern United States. Research assistants noted whether they worked in a private office (with a door that can be closed) or a cubicle. They also counted the number of items each worker had brought from home to decorate his or her workspace - a list that included photographs, posters, artworks. Not surprisingly, Laurence and his colleagues found a connection between the amount of privacy an employee enjoys and his or her rate of burnout. \"High privacy conditions tend to serve as strong protectors against unwelcome interferences and distractions ,\" they noted, \"contributing to a work environment supporting reduced emotional exhaustion.\" But this link disappeared when those employees had personalized their cubicles. Employees who had turned their workspaces into areas that reflect their interests and personalities reported the same (relatively low) level of emotional exhaustion, no matter whether they worked in an office or a cubicle. The research confirms \"the calming effect\" of having your own stuff around you. So if you're feeling exhausted at work, relief could be as simple as hanging a few of your kindergartener's colorful creations on your cubicle wall. Where does this passage probably come from?",

Tommy, a seven-year-old dog, belonged to Maria Lochi, 57, and had been her faithful partner after she adopted him when she found him in fields close to her home. Mrs. Lochi adopted several dogs she found but friends said she developed a close friendship with Tommy and would walk to church with him every day, where he would be allowed to sit patiently by her feet. Father Panna said, \"He's there every time I celebrate Mass and is very well behaved. He doesn't make a sound, and I've not heard one bark from him in all the time he has been in. He used to come with Maria and he was obviously devoted to her. I let him stay inside as he was always so well behaved and none of the other people ever complained to me. He's still coming to Mass even after Maria's funeral, he just sat there quietly. I didn't have the heart to throw him out. I've just recently lost my own dog so I leave him there until Mass finishes and then I let him out.\" Tommy's been adopted by everyone in the village now and he is everybody's friend. Everyone looks out for him and leaves food for him, although it would be nice to find a proper home for him. The story of Tommy is similar to the 2009 Hollywood filmHachiwhich told of how a faithful Akita dog waits patiently for his master after he also dies. It was based on the true story of a Japanese Akita called Hachi, whose owner died in 1925 but for the next nine years he waited patiently at the railway station for his owner from where they regularly caught a train.

        "question": "Walt Disney is credited for creating such wonderful things as Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. However, he cannot take the credit for creating other well-loved characters, such as Cinderella and Snow White. _ are almost automatically associated with Disney because Disney turned old fables  into cartoon movies. The original Cinderella varies very much from the Disney version we know today. It started off with the girl mourning her mother's death and going to her tomb three times a day. In addition, there were only birds that helped Cinderella; there was no such thing as a fairy godmother or helpful mice, nor was there mention of a horse and carriage. The stepsisters were cruel: they always threw Cinderella's food into the ashes of the fire and made her sleep on the ashes on the floor, hence her name. In the original story, the king's ball actually lasted for three days. With the help of the birds, the girl, beautifully dressed, danced with the prince on all three nights and the prince fell in love with her. However, she broke away from him to rush back home each night. On the last night, the prince placed soothing sticky on the stairs; as Cinderella made her escape, a shoe got stuck on it. Here now is where the story becomes unpleasant: when the prince went to the house looking for the girl whose foot fit the shoe, the wicked  stepmother told one of her two daughters to cut off her big toe to fit into the shoe. The daughter did as told. So the prince took her away to be his bride. But when they passed the tomb of Cinderella's mother, the birds called out to the prince, \"Turn and peep, there's blood in the shoe; the shoe is too small, the true bride waits for you.\" ZXXK Realizing he had been tricked, the prince returned the daughter to her mother. The other then had to cut off part of her heel in order to fit into the shoe, with the same result. Only Cinderella's foot fit perfectly and so the prince chose to marry her. The story ends with the wedding day: as Cinderella's two stepsisters followed her, pretending to be devoted to her so that they could enjoy the king's riches, two birds flew by and plucked  out their eyes. Because of their wickedness and falsehood, they had to spend the rest of their days blind. The original Cinderella is so different from the Disney version. Thank goodness Disney made such changes; it indeed was a wise move. What does the author think of the Disney version?",

By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified  as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes.  Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \"We're waking up,\" he says. \"But not fast enough.\"  In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate  their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a $1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further.  Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days.  City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it. Homeowners who waste water are given large fines. There are 1.9 million people who live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now it has grown by more than 300,000 people since 2002.

Did you know that a small today used to be a medium, 20 years ago? A recent research shows 97%of teens need more exercise. It's bad news because too little exercise means you are missing a lot of good things in life. Exercise helps in two ways. First,exercise helps your body. Physical activity can make your body strong. It can also keep you at a healthy weight. Doctors say that people who stay at a healthy weight have fewer health problems. Second,exercise can help your mind. People who get plenty of physical activity might worry less and sleep better at night. You may even learn better in school. Students who are healthy can listen and understand better in class. So you can change your life and be more active at any point. It's never too late. An article called  \"How to Limit Screen Time and Get Moving\"gives these ideas: Step away from the screen. Doctors call watching TV or playing video games screen time. You should have no more than two hours of screen time a day. You will enjoy life more if you live it instead of watching it! Start slowly. An hour a day can seem like a long time. Start with 10 minutes of new activities every day. Add more as you get stronger. Think about walking. Take the stairs instead of the lift. You will feel healthier. Make fitness fun. Find a sport you like. It doesn't need to be the traditional sports of basketball, soccer,or baseball. Those are all great sports and if you like them, play them. However,you can also try hiking,skateboarding,or even rope jumping. If you enjoy the sport,you will do it. Choose food carefully. Help your family shop for healthy food. Read the labels .Look for healthy foods. Eat lots of fiuits and vegetables. Stop buying soft drinks and junk foods. You will feel better if you eat right.

DNA is something that everybody has, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our mother and father, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Gregor Mendel discovered a special reason why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things named \"genes\" in our body. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick made another discovery and found out that those small parts are real messages written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Johann Matthaci found a message in DNA showing how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. Scientists have now found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \"word\"   means, we can help save more people from several illnesses. Most people hope that this will help make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when people begin to know more words and find out lots of other information, we might use it in a wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people from getting jobs.

The Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space says more than 1,300 fires are burning across the country. The government has sent about 25,000 soldiers, police and firefighters in six provinces to battle the fires. Indonesian farmers and some businesses often burn rainforest to clear land at this time of year. The burning usually takes place during the country's dry season. But a large rise in palm oil production on peat lands is blamed for the many fires this year. Peat is made partly of dead plants, which burns easily and is often used as cooking fuel. The resulting thick, black smoke has polluted skies over Indonesia and four other countries. The burning has worsened air quality, closed schools and caused any outdoor activities to stop. The smoke is not only affecting people; it is affecting wildlife. In Indonesian Borneo, an animal rescue center says some of its animals have developed breathing problems. If the fires continue, a lot more could become sick and some could die. Scientists have warned that the fires this year could be worst ever because of a weather system called El Nino.

He slept better than usual that night. The following day, many people came to the shop. Mr. Jones said good morning to them all with a bright smile and asked the frist woman what she wanted. She chose some writing paper and a pencil. As soon as he put them on her hands, she turned to leave the shop. \"That will be thirty cents ,please,\" he said. \"Why?\" she asked in surprise. \"That's the price of the paper and the pencil.\" \"But your notice says it's free,\" she replied. \"Oh no,\" he said, \"how can I make any money if everything is free?\" She took him outside and showed him the notice \"It is wrong,too,\"she said. \"where is the question mark after the word 'think'?\" \"There isn't a question mark,\"he said. \"But there should be one .\" \"I'm afraid you've made a mistake,\" Mr.Jones said.\"You have read my notice in the wrong way.\" \"Not at all,\" said the woman. \"It is quite easy to read. It says: What do you think? I give away pencils and paper and ink!\" \"No,\" Mr.Jones said. \"You should read it like this: _ And the answer to the question is: Certainly not!

        "question": "Several years ago, the mayor of Chicago, Illinois, visited Germany, a leader in green roof design. Later he decided to have vegetation planted on Chicago City Hall. Today, the tops of many other buildings also look like parks. In Canada, the Coast Plaza Hotel in Vancouver has a forest on its roof. New York City has an unusual example farm for hydroponics. The farm is on a boat called the Science Barge. Rainwater and river water are used to grow lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. The farm shows the possibilities for designing rooftop systems. Green roofs are designed to save energy and capture rainwater. Rooftops covered with plants help keep buildings cool. They can extend the life of a roof. And they can reduce water running off into streets and storming water systems. Experts say green roofs usually do not get much above 27degC. So temperatures might not be a problem for growing. But rooftop gardeners have to be careful not to put too much weight on the roof. This is true whether plants are grown in soil or water. Earlier in 2008, researchers in Texas reported that green roofs can reduce a building's air conditioning costs by about onefifth compared to blacktop roofs.  But they also reported that not all green roofs perform equally well. They found that designs differ in their ability to keep buildings cool and to capture rainwater. The researchers put experimental roofs on top of metal insulated   boxes, to recreate green roof conditions. The study compared products from six companies to help businesses understand how to improve their designs. Each rooftop had sixteen different kinds of plants native to Texas. The researchers say the presence of native plants likely helped all the green roofs capture water better compared to sedums. Sedums are plants that need little water and often are used on green roofs. The native plants could take in more water and release more of it to the atmosphere.

Bose has a large circle of friends, and there's one who you may have heard of: President Obama. He has twice publicly recognized her achievements in cancer research and spoken with her in the Oval Office. If that isn't enough, Bose recently gave a TED Talk about her work with the cancer drug Cisplatin, which also won her first prize at the Google Science Fair and recognition as one of Glamour magazine's Young Amazing Women of the Year. After watching her grandfather struggle with liver cancer, Bose was determined to help out in any way she could. As a high school student though, her scientific choices were limited. She reached out to various hospitals and research centers, but doctors turned down her requests because they felt she was too inexperienced medically. Only the North Texas Science Health Center respected her determination and chose to guide her. The results were amazing. Bose chose to study a protein   and its reaction with the cancer drug Cisplatin. She noticed that when she prevented this protein from growing, Cisplatin was allowed to begin destroying cancer cells once again. \"My project not only contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the protein and Cisplatin, but also suggests a newer, more effective treatment for patients who resist Cisplatin,\" Bose said. Bose's achievements aren't limited to the lab, though. She was also captain of her swim team and editor-in-chief of her school paper.

        "question": "It seems that great artists and scientists often suffer from mental problems. Both Einstein and Dickens had mental illness. Now scientists have started to look at whether mental illness and genius are linked . Dr. Adele Juda studied 5,000 creative people in Germany. She found there were more people with mental illness in this group than in the general population. Poets had the highest rate  of mental illness, followed by musicians, with lower numbers for painters and architects. Other scientists did research which also showed a strong link between mental problems and creativity. But, it did nothing to explain it. Dr. Ruth Richards of Harvard University _ . Instead of studying creative people, she took a group of psychiatric  patients and tested them for creativity. The patients got much higher scores than a normal group. Also, the patients' close relatives were much more creative than the patients and a normal group. This suggests that the key to the link between creativity and mental illness is in our genes . But this is a problem. According to Darwinism, harmful genes should be removed. Some scientists believe that evolution  has created a balance, where the madness of a few people leads to the development of the whole human race. Geniuses may be mad, bad or just difficult to understand, but their discoveries have improved the world we live in. It seems that a little creative madness is good for us all.

We were busy through those hot summer months, driving between visits. Our work was strictly done at the pet owner's home. It was almost too busy for the two of us, but we were making good money! We asked pet owners new to our business to phone two weeks ahead so we had enough time to meet the owners and pets at their homes and make any following meetings before the owner leaves. One day, we decided to take on a new customer just two days before they would leave. We met the family, filled in a form, and spent some time with their dog, Hercules. He playfully jumped on us and touched our hands and arms using his tongue. The family laughed as he did this, showing us that he was very loving. Two days later I appeared at the house, alone. I came up to Hercules and said hello happily. I filled up his water bowl and cleaned any messes he made. Meanwhile, he was so lovely sitting beside. I thought this would be the good picture to send to the owners as usual. After the light and \"click\" sound went off, Hercules rushed at me. I didn't know what had just happened until I noticed the drops of blood. I ran out and did the only thing--calling my husband. Then I went to neighbors for help. My husband arrived after ten minutes. The helpful neighbor and my husband led Hercules back into his pen . Then my husband and I took off to the hospital. I must have looked like I was shot when I walked into the hospital.

Today, they want risk and excitement -- the closer to the edge, the better. They snowboard over cliff and hike deep mountains. Extreme sports started as an alternative to more expensive sports such as golf. A city kid who couldn't afford expensive sports equipment could get a skateboard and have fun. But now it has become a whole new area of sports, with specialized equipment and high levels of skill. There is even an Olympics for extreme sports, called the winter x-game, which includes snow mountain hiking and ice climbing. What makes extreme sports so popular? Maybe it's because people love the risk. City people want to be outdoors on the weekends and do something challenging. The new equipment is so much better that people can take more risks without getting hurt. Sure there's a risk. Once you go mountain hiking or snowboarding, it's impossible to go back to have riding or skiing. It's just too boring. Now even the older crowd is starting to join in. Every weekend, groups of friends in their early 30s get together. On weekdays they work as computer programmers in the same office. On weekends they hike mountains together.

        "question": "Look at the keyboard of any standard typewriter or computer.\"Q,\"\"W,\"\"E,\"\"R\"\"T\"and\"Y\"are the first six letters.Who decided on this arrangement of the letters? And why? People tried for centuries to invent the typewriter.In 1714 in England,Henry Mill filed a patent for a machine called An Artificial Machine Or Method for the Impressing or Transcribing of Letters,Singly or Progressively one after another, as in Writing,whereby all Writing whatsoever may be Engrossed in Paper or Parchment so Neat and Exact as not to be distinguished from Print.That machine probably didn't sell because no one could remember its name! The first practical typewriter was patented in the United States in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes.His machine was known as the type-writer.It had a movable carriage,a lever for turning paper from line to line,and a keyboard on which the letters were arranged in alphabetical order. But Sholes had a problem.On his first model,his\"ABC\"key arrangement caused the keys to jam when the typist worked quickly.Sholes didn't know how to keep the keys from sticking,so his solution was to keep the typist from typing too fast.Sholes asked his brother-in-1aw to rearrange the keyboard so that the commonest letters were not so close together and the type bars would come from opposite directions.Thus they would not clash together and jam the machine.The new arrangement was the QWERTY arrangement typists use today.Of course,Sholes claimed that the new arrangement was scientific and would add speed and efficiency.The only efficiency it added was to slow the typist down,since almost any word in the English language required the typist's fingers to cover more distance on the keyboard. The advantages of the typewriter outweighed the disadvantages of the keyboard.Typists memorized the crazy letter arrangement,and the typewriter became a huge success.By the time typists had memorized the new arrangement of letters and built their speed,typewriter technology had improved,and the keys didn't stick as badly as they had at first.

But without pain, everyday activities can be hazardous for Ashlyn. In fact, they could kill her. When Ashlyn was born, no one knew that she couldn't feel pain. But soon there was hints that something was wrong. When Ashlyn's teeth grew in, she almost chewed off part on her tongue. Ashlyn's parents took her to doctor for tests. The doctors discovered that Ashlyn couldn't feel pain, a condition called congenital insensitivity to pain(CIPA). Fewer than 100 people in the United States have it. There is no cure. . \"Sometimes it's frustrating,\" she admits. But Ashlyn doesn't let anything stop her from doing things she wants to do. \"I just have to be careful,\" she says. For years, Ashlyn didn't know anyone else who had CIPA. That made it harder to deal with her condition. \"I felt alone,\" she says. One night she dreamed that there was a camp for kids like her. In 2011, Ashly's mom made the dream come true. She started Camp Painless But Hopeless. The camp is for children who have CIPA. Every November, they and their families spend four days together. The campers get to do daring activities like rock climbing--wearing safety equipment. Someday, Ashlyn wants to be a director at the camp so she can help others who can't feel pain. In fact, Ashlyn is already helping others. Since 2004, she has let scientists study her to learn more about her condition.

But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias  much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological  . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\"scaredy cat\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'.\" If we fail to help children to overcome fears, they will  _  .",

Everyone, places for act one!\" called the director. The lights went out and the rehearsal began. Halfway through the first act, Brittany finished her part and went backstage. She grabbed her script from the table and read along with the rehearsal that was still going on in front of the curtain. A small group of fellow actors joined her, and started practicing lines. Suddenly, something wet exploded on the back of Brittany's head! Turning around, she saw a tall girl with a beverage bottle in her hand. Sticky blue liquid slid down Brittany's face. The older girl laughed . Brittany glanced at her, expecting someone else to speak up and defend her. However, they all screamed with laughter and pointed mocking fingers at Brittany, who ran out of the make-up room in dismay.   Ten minutes later, Brittany met me backstage. \"A big girl just sprayed me with this stuff and laughed at me,\" she said, trying to wipe the liquid out of her curly hair. \"All the other girls laughed, too.\" I didn't even know the girl's name, and she was bullying my sister ! When we got home, we looked at the cast list and found that the girl's name was Jessica. Our mom e-mailed the director, who said she would talk to Jessica and arrange time for an apology right before the next rehearsal. Nobody really expected a heartfelt apology from Jessica but Brittany was prepared to forgive her. Before the next rehearsal, the director met Brittany at the door and announced that we had a problem on our hands. \"Jessica swears that she was never even near you yesterday,\" she said. But Brittany knew the truth. As she glanced across the room full of young actors, she glimpsed Jessica sitting in a metal folding chair. For a split second, their eyes met. Jessica quickly turned away to stare in the opposite direction. For weeks afterwards, no matter how hard Brittany tried to talk to her, Jessica refused to look her way. It was very difficult for Brittany to work with Jessica during every rehearsal , for three hours each week. But finally, we were ready to perform. There would be three performances over the course of the next weekend. Brittany and I were glad that the ordeal was almost over. After the first show, Brittany and I each got a beautiful bouquet from our church's pastor and his wife. Jessica didn't get a single flower. The second night, we received flowers from our grandparents. Again, Jessica received nothing. On the way home, Brittany spoke up. \"Mommy\", she said quietly from the back seat of the car, \"I've been thinking, and I decided to buy some flowers for Jessica,\" Mom smiled in surprise and replied, \"That would be very nice.\" Before the last performance, Brittany met Jessica on the way to the theater. She handed the older girl a big bunch of yellow roses, bought with her own savings. \"Great job with the show last night, Jessica. These are for you.\" Jessica was astonished. \"For me?\" she said. \"These flowers are for me? Are you sure?\" \"Yes I want you to have them!\" Brittany skipped towards the dressing room, leaving Jessica staring at her with a confused look on her face and a bouquet of beautiful flowers in her arms.  That night, Jessica finally received some flowers from her dad. She pulled out a spring of carnations and smiled shyly as she gave them to Brittany. Maybe Jessica will never apologize to Brittany. Maybe she won't ever even admit her mistake. But she is just beginning to realize what wonderful things a person's love does in people like Brittany. What would be the best title for the passage ?",

She waited for a bus, got on it and sat down next to an o1d 1ady. After a while, Mrs. White noticed that the old 1ady's handbag was open. Inside it, she saw a wad of pound notes exactly like the ones her husband had given her. So she quickly looked into her own bag -- the notes had gone! Mrs. White was sure that the o1d lady next to her had stolen them. She immediately thought of calling the police. But as she disliked making a fuss , she decided to take back the money from the old 1ady's hand bag and say nothing about it. She looked around to make sure nobody was watching. Then she carefully put her hand into the o1d lady's bag, took the notes, and put them into her own handbag.      When she got home that evening, Mrs. White showed her husband the beautiful hat she had bought.      \"How did you pay for it?\" Mr. White asked.      \"With the money you gave me for my birthday, of course\" she answered.  \"Oh?

        "question": "If you're networking   and nothing is happening, you might need to evaluate how you're doing it. Maybe you show up at each event and still feel challenged by the process. You aggressively talk to people, give out your cards, call endlessly to schedule an appointment but have no real success from your efforts. To help you gain a different future, here are ten habits you should avoid. Ineffective networkers: 1. Lack patience. They expect immediate results and want business now, not tomorrow. 2. Constantly \"selling\" something. They see dollar signs every time they shake hands with someone. 3. Too many choices. If they offer a variety of products, they might try too hard to tell about all of them. Offering too much information sends a confusing message making it difficult for people to send referral  . Opportunities are all around us but when you're networking, only focus on one. 4. Change positions too often. If they move from company to company or do something totally different, it might be difficult for people to keep up with them. 5. Lack manners and respect. They interrupt others, talk with food in their mouth, aren't very polite and appear unprofessional. They call people during dinner or on the weekends without thinking whether the occasion is suitable. 6. Distribute too many cards and sales literature. They come while loading with brochures, flyers  , catalogues and samples. 7. Focus on themselves. Too much self promotion can leave the other person to feel unappreciated. Every sentence begins with \"I\" and is all about their business. 8. \"Talking\" instead of \"giving\". They don't realize what other people sense when they are being very selfish. Others may think that they are being taken advantage of. 9. Lack authenticity   and personal values. They may create unrealistic expectations and not deliver on their promises. Sometimes doing things without integrity   possibly twists the truth. 10. Poor communication and interpersonal skills. They have trouble speaking effectively, building relationships and following up. Networking is a process that is an investment of time and money. If you find you're doing any of these habits, consider learning how to improve on these and maximize your results while networking.

The National Development and Reform Commission, the Standardization Administration of China, the Ministry of Agriculture and six other departments announced their 2004-05 development programme for national food standards over the weekend. China is conducting a rectification   within two years. Inspectors will search for all known banned materials in food production. To reduce trading barriers, China will raise the ratio of adopting international standards in the food industry to 55 percent from today's 23 percent. \"Safety is the first consideration for anything entering people's mouth followed by its nutritious value,\" said Hao Yu, secretary-general of the National Food Industry Standardization Technique Committee. He added the usage of food addictives   will be a major field for consideration in setting the new standards. On-the-spot checks during the past two years have shown the abuse   or misuse of addictives in food production and processing has become the biggest threat to food safety. In one case, talcum   powder was found in flour products, which is outlawed according to national food standards. \"At present there are no methods or standards to test the content of talcum powder in flour,\" said Shang Yan'e, an official with the national watchdog on grain and oil inspections. Under the guidelines, all banned addictives will be recorded as inspections increase, Relevant departments have allocated   funds to conduct risk evaluations on current food addictives to fix the limits of their usage.

It is a 9-mile man-made river that goes through London. We went into a big market and saw crazy signs, fun T-shirts, and things like hand-made earrings for sale. We bought Chinese fried noodles. It tasted very different from the noodles we make at home, and we ate it with a fork instead of chopsticks! Camden is famous for the punk style that started in the 1970s. Punks walked around with bright pink and green hair, broken clothes with safety pins, metal buttons and pierced ears and lips. Punk music shops played loud, heavy rock music. But there were also groups of hippies with big sweaters. They sat in cafes drinking soymilk, with black clothes, black lipstick and painted white faces. Besides all these \"normal\" people, a lot of famous people come to Camden. Actor Orlando Bloom from Pirates of the Caribbean lives there. Camden is especially known as a home to famous musicians.

        "question": "Having driven almost thirty hours, I decided to stay in South Carolina for a few days. The next morning, I purchased a three-day fishing license and bait   before heading to the lake. Opening my trunk, I carefully took out my fishing gear  , put it on the lake's edge, baited up and began to fish. \"Good morning,\" said someone, walking up from behind me. Turning around, I saw a game warden   with a clip-board. \"Good morning,\" I said, nodding my head. \"Catch any fish?\" he asked. \"No sir, just relaxing and killing time.\" \"Can I see your fishing license?\" I handed him the license I had purchased at the bait shop. \"Can I see your driver's license, too?\" he requested. \"I see the name on the driver's license is spelled Kiser and the name on the fishing license is Kaiser,\" said the warden. \"The gentleman at the bait shop must have written it wrong,\" I told him. \"Well, I'm afraid I'll have to write you up for fishing with an invalid license and take away your fishing gear.\" \"You've got to be kidding,\" I responded, with a surprised look on my face. Sure enough I was written up and my fishing gear taken away. I was told that I would have to pay a fine and that my stuff would be sold at auction . I stood there almost in tears as he drove away. Those rods and reels were very special to me. I had used them over twenty years, fishing with my friends, who were now all dead. After returning home in Georgia, I telephoned South Carolina trying to explain the situation, but no one would listen. I was told that the Department of Fish and Game had a \"zero tolerance\" for fishing and hunting violations. Finally, in tears I paid the fine and gave up the fight. Nine months later, I received a letter. I had no idea who it was from as there was no return address. On a plain piece of notebook paper was written \"Auction for the Department of Fish and Game held this Saturday at 11:00 am.\" On Saturday, at six in the morning I headed to South Carolina. By ten o'clock I had found the auction. There were numerous boats and piles upon piles of fishing equipment. All at once, there it was--my wonderful stuff all thrown in a pile as if it was worth nothing. As the auction began I took my seat. In my wallet was twenty-seven dollars. For more than an hour I waited for my property to be brought to the auction block. \"We have three rods and reels here. I guess we will sell this as a unit,\" said the auctioneer. \"50 dollars,\" yelled someone in the crowd. \"51 dollars,\" yelled another man. I rose from my seat and walked out of the auction. \"66 dollars,\" I heard as the bidding continued. \"100 dollars,\" came another bid. The auction became silent. \"100 dollars once, 100 dollars twice, 100 dollars three times. Sold for 100 dollars,\" went the auctioneer. I walked to my truck, got in and just sat there. Suddenly I heard something hit the side of my truck. Turning around, I saw the back of a man putting my three rods and reels into my truck. It was the same game warden who wrote me the ticket almost a year ago! As I got out of the truck he stuck out his hand and said, \"I wasn't wrong. _ \" I shook his hand, thanked him and drove away. I cried as I crossed the South Carolina Georgia state line. What did the game warden mean by saying \"It's the law that is wrong\"?",

        "question": "Do you often feel lonely? What do you do when you feel that way? Hide yourself away and spend your time reading, watching TV or walking around? You might think that feeling lonely is just like feeling happy, sad or scared -- that it's just one of your various moods. That is true. However, if you let yourself be lonely for too long without dealing with it, you could be making a serious mistake. Doctors have known for some time that feeling lonely is bad for the mind. It can lead to mental health problems such as depression, stress and reduce confidence. \"Being lonely means not feeling connected or cared for, but it's not about being mentally alone,\" Lisa Jaremka, scientist from Ohio State University, US, told Live Science in January. And there's growing evidence that not having friends is connected with physical illness as well. In 2006, for example, scientists studied 2,800 women who had cancer. They found that those who had few friends or family were five times more likely to die of their disease than women with many social contacts. Also, even healthy people had a better chance of falling ill if they felt left out by others, according to the BBC. The results have scientists thinking that loneliness might hurt the immune system , which protects the body from diseases. Hoping to prove this theory, Jaremka and her research team put volunteers  through a stress test. During the test, volunteers were asked to make an unprepared speech in front of a group of stony-faced people. The researchers found that volunteers who said they were lonely in their daily lives felt more stress during the test. And their blood samples showed that all the stress had managed to cause harmful changes to their immune system. \"Loneliness has been thought of in many ways as a chronic stressor  -- a socially painful situation that can last for quite a long time, \" explained Jaremka, who led the study. The number of people suffering from loneliness is increasing all over the world. However, solving the problem is easier said than done. It won't work to just \"tell anyone to go out and find someone to love you\", said Jaremka. \"We need to create support networks.\" If people feel lonely for a long time,   _  .",

The Romans had warm public baths. In some baths, as many 3,000 persons could bathe at the same time. Treating disease by taking bathing has been popular for centuries. Modern medical bathing first became popular in Europe and by the late 1700's has also become popular in the United States. For many years frequent bathing was believed to be bad for one's health. Ordinary bathing just to keep clean was avoided , and _ was often used to cover up body smells! By the 1700's doctors began to say that soap and water were good for health. They believed that it was good for people to be clean. Slowly, people began to bathe more frequently. During the Victorian Age of the late 19th century, taking a bath on Saturday night became common. In the United States ordinary bathing was slow to become popular. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, many Americans were known as \"The Great Unwashed!\" In one American city , for example, a person was only allowed to take a bath every thirty days! That was a law! Frequency of bathing today is partly a matter of habit. People know that bathing for cleanliness is important to health, Doctors know that dirty bodies increase the chance of diseases. As a result, in the United States, people generally bathe often. Some people bathe once a day at least. They consider a daily bath essential  to good health. In the 18th century doctors believed that being clean was  _  .",

        "question": "If you want to make friends and form strong, lasting friendships, consider these suggestions. To make friends, you first need to put yourself out there somehow. Friends seldom come knocking on your door while you sit at home watching TV. Join a club with people who have common interests. You don't necessarily have to have a lot of common interests with people in order to make friends with them. In fact, some of the most rewarding friendships are between two people who don't have much in common at all, but if you have something in common with people, it can make it a lot easier to start a conversation and plan activities together. Use the web and get out! Websites like Meetup.com are aiming to bring people together with common interest. You can join any group or just start your own. If you don't know of a specific topic, try searching for just a location. It's a great way to meet new local people!  Join a sports team. A common misconception about this is that you have to be really good at playing a particular sport in order to make friends with others on the team, but not all teams are so competitive. As long as you enjoy the sport and support your teammates, joining a local team with a laid-back attitude could be a great way to make new friends.  Volunteer. Volunteering is a great way for people of all ages to meet others. By working together you build bonds with people, and you might meet others who have a passion for doing things the way you do. To make friends, besides spending more time around people, you also need to talk to people. Who is the passage written mainly for?",

Apple has launched a new iPhone every year since it unveiled the range in 2007, selling more than 500 million units since then, and has traditionally launched key products in September. The iPhone 6, Apple's ninth iPhone model, is expected to be released in two different sizes:4.7-inches and 5.5-inches. The smaller of the two will be available first. Like iPhone5, the new model will come in silver , gold and space grey. The iPhone 6 will be powered by new operating system iOS 8. Through iOS8, users will be able to monitor  their health and fitness via HealthKit. HealthKit puts together numerous healthcare and fitness apps, such as blood pressure and heart rate monitors through partners including Nike, and allows them to communicate with each other. Users will be able to control home appliances and other connected devices through HomeKit, Apple's connected home framework. Similar to HealthKit, this app will organize your smart devices to control them in one place. One method of control will be via Siri-for example, you could tell Siri you were \"going to bed\", and it could dim the lights, lock your doors, close the garage door and set the room temperature. With the introduction of both of these key features, it's likely the iPhone 6 will take on even more of a lifestyle device role. It is designed to organize our lives and make everyday tasks easier and more efficiently completed. Suppliers are believed to be preparing to produce up to 80m of the new handsets by the end of December, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Some beauty products can cause lasting damage that goes far below the surface of the skin. In America,many people use sunlight and non-natural light to darken their skin. Health experts advise against what is called\"tanning\"because of its links to akin cancer. In the African country of Senegal ,some women take health risks trying to do just the opposite. An average beauty supply shop in Dakar has many kinds of skin-lightening creams and soaps. The World Health Organization says that 25%of Senegalese women use skin-lightening production a usual basis. These products can contain chemicals,like mercury ,hydroquinone ,etc. These are dangerous ingredients that can cause cancer and possibly other physical damage to the akin. They can actually burn the eyes and skin. Shop worker Adama Diagne advises her visitors to avoid the stronger products that promise fast results. She users a cream that is made from carrots,not the strong chemical,hydroquinone. She says that it is a personal choice and that no one pressures her. Some women want to be black every day,but for her,she likes to be a shade of brown. Women in Senegal say they lighten their skin for the same reason that women all over the world make changes to their appearance. They say they want to look beautiful,to find a husband, to stand out in a crowd or simply to look great for a special event. This thinking troubles Senegalese film-maker Khardiata Pouye Sall. So,she made\"This Color That Bothers Me\",a film about the subject of skin lightening. She said,\"I used the most shocking images so that women would see the dangers. It is hard to understand why a woman says that dark skin is not beautiful. It is in their heads. They want to please a man,to he loved or they want to please society,to succeed.\" Ms. Sall says that the government needs to better control the marketing and the sale of skin-lightening products.

The beginning of our sleep-deficit(lack)crises can be traced back to the invention of the light bulb a century ago.From diary entries and our personal accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries, sleep scientists have reached the conclusion that the average person used to sleep about 9.5 hours a night.\"The best sleep habits once were forced on us, when we had nothing to do in the evening down on the farm, and it was dark.\" By the 1950s and 1960s, the sleep schedule had been reduced dramatically, to between 7.5 and 8 hours, and most people had to wake to an alarm clock.\"People cheat in their sleep, and they don't even realize they're doing it,\" says Dr.David.\"They think they're okay because they can get by on 6.5 hours, when they really need 7.5, 8 or even more to feel ideally energetic. \" Perhaps the most merciless robber of sleep, researches say, is the complexity of the day.Whenever pressures from work, family, friends and community increase, many people consider sleep the least expensive item on their programs.\"In our society, you're considered dynamic if you say you need only 5.5 hours' sleep.If you've got to get 8.5 hours, people think you lack drive and ambition.\" To determine the consequences of sleep-deficit, researchers have put subjects through a set of psychological and performance tests requiring them, for instance, to add columns of numbers or recall a passage read to them only minutes earlier.\"We've found that if you're in sleep deficit, performance suffers,\" says Dr.David.\"Short-term memory is weakened, as are abilities to make decisions and to concentrate.\" The major cause of sleep-deficit of modern people is   _  .",

        "question": "Visitors can find a small, old house called the O. Henry Museum in central Austin, Texas. William Sydney Porter(1862-1910)----better known as O. Henry, was one of America's best loved writers of short stories. Beginning in 1893, he lived here. It was saved from destruction, moved, and turned into a museum in 1934. The museum is a good way to learn about the interesting life of him. William Porter rented this house and lived with his wife and daughter for about two years. Many objects in the museum belonged to the Porters. Others did not, but are in the house to recreate the way it looked during their lifetime. Porter worked at a pharmacy, farm, land office and bank. He also loved words and writing. The museum has special proof of Porter's love of language---his dictionary. It's said that he read every word in it. Porter started a small publication called \"The Rolling Stone\". He wasn't being published early on, so he published himself. His funny stories, poems, and drawings were published in the magazine. But it was too costly to continue for long, so he closed the project after about one year. Other troubles would lead the Porters to leave Austin. Porter was accused of financial wrongdoing at the bank and lost his job. Fearing a trial, he fled the country. But he returned because his wife was dying. After her death, he faced trial and was found guilty. He served three and a half years in a federal prison in Ohio. Porter would keep his time in prison a secret. But there was one good thing about it. It provided him with time to write. By the time of his release, he had published 14 stories and was becoming well-known as O. Henry. Porter would later move to New York City and find great success there. He published over 380 stories in the last eight years of his life. What does the author want to tell us in the passage?",

Global warming is the idea that greenhouse gases that shut in infra-red   radiation in the earth' s atmosphere are becoming more powerful and heating our planet up. The theory is that if the planet continues to heat up the polar ice caps could melt and cover the earth in water. Over the last 100 years the Earth has increased one degree in temperature, and sea level has risen millimeters. Even though this \"eye-opening\" news is taking place, there is no clear proof saying that it is due to global warming. It could be just a regular weather pattern the earth is circulating. The polar ice caps have not grown or reduced in size since man began tracking them. Also the ground-based temperature has remained the same besides growing cities. In fact most clues support the idea that global warming is not taking place and human activity isn't causing any earth to melt down.

Body language, especially eye contact, is very important to a relationship. With one glance we can tell the mood of a close friend, if they are happy or sad. Thus, visual contact has a major impact on the amount of understanding we have with another person and the amount of connection that can be achieved. However, when the telephone, email and message come into play, all of that human interaction is lost. We have increasingly less human contact and start lacking social skills because of a lack of communication. Technology greatly influences our standpoint on how fast we think everything needs to be done. If you put a dollar in the soda machine, you expect the bottle to move forward and fall down to the bottom. You can' t count how many times you' ve  _ the machine if it went too slow for your expectations. You wanted instant results, immediate fulfillment. Another shot against healthy relationships is everyone ' s demanding need for excitement. Society in general has increased its expectations for excitement. Little kids spending time playing outside together now replace that with hours of playing video games alone at home. On the weekends we seize every minute with \" exciting\" activities, rushing from one to the next.

Without purpose and goals - certainly directed thought-you are like \"ship without a rudder. \" There is power in your purpose and in your goals.4 One of my favorite passages of James Allen is one he wrote in The Mastery of Destiny: \"All successful people are people of purpose. They hold fast to an idea, a project, a plan, and will not let it go; they treasure it and develop it; and when upset by difficulties, they refuse to give in; the greater the difficulties are, the stronger the purpose is. \" And that's worth thinking about.

After she said that, all I could think about was what kinds of clothes I would choose. To my surprise, my mom allowed me to pick out three dresses: a pink one, a blue one and a yellow one. The yellow one was my favorite. I had a best friend named Seema, whose family was even poorer than ours. We played and studied together, and spent the best days of our childhood laughing at the silly stories we made up. I was excited to show her my three beautiful new dresses. She loved them all and was happy for me, but tearfully explained to me that her father could only afford to buy her clothes for her birthday. I felt sorry, and then did something that surprised even myself: I asked her to pick out one of my dresses for herself. To my disappointment, she picked up my favorite--the yellow one. Please remember, I was only seven years. My heart almost popped out   of my chest. But as she held it against her body, and I saw how brightly she smiled, I stopped feeling any hurt. I told her it looked lovely on her. I'll always remember Seema's smile, and how at that moment nothing mattered more. When you value your friendships, nothing else matters!

Leaders from the preceding Song dynasty were unhappy about being ruled by foreigners, so they began to organize a secret rebellion. The leaders of the rebellion, knowing that the Moon Festival was drawing near, ordered the making of special cakes. Baked into each cake was a message containing the outline of the attack. On the night of the Moon Festival, the rebels successfully attacked and overthrew the government. Today, these cakes are eaten to commemorate this legend and are called Moon Cakes. For generations, moon cakes have been made with sweet fillings of nuts, mashed red beans, lotus-seed paste or Chinese dates, wrapped in pastry. Sometimes a cooked egg yolk can be found in the middle of this rich tasting dessert.

        "question": "When the Apollo astronauts   landed on the Moon in 1969, millions of people were rather sad. The person to blame for this was an artist named Chesley Bonestell. For many years, Bonestell had been creating beautifully detailed paintings of the Moon and planets. Viewers of his artwork were unhappy because the real Moon did not look like Bonestell's pictures of it. As a space artist, Bonestell tried to make his drawings look exciting and as true as the Moon is. He worked closely with astronomers and scientists to get the most up-to-date scientific information available. But in the 1940s and 1950s, no one had ever seen another planet up close. Yet Bonestell's paintings looked so real that some people thought they were photographs. Even though Bonestell was interested in astronomy, he did not start out as a space artist. As a young man he studied architecture -- the art and science of designing and making buildings. In 1938 Bonestell became a special effects artist in Hollywood. It was here that he learned he could improve his paintings by following the methods used in the movies. In 1944, a popular magazine published a series of Bonestell's paintings of the planet Saturn. He drew Saturn as if it were seen by someone standing on each of the planet's moons. The results were _ . Within a few years, Bonestell's artwork was appearing regularly in magazines and books on astronomy and space flight. Many of Bonestell's artworks had been right all along. But the biggest surprise was the Moon. Someone asked Bonestell what he was thinking when he saw the first pictures from the Moon. \"I thought how wrong I was!\" he said. \"My mountains were sharp  , and they aren't on the Moon.\" But he shouldn't have felt bad. No space artist had ever before taken so many people to so many faraway worlds. In the years just before the first manned space flights, Bonestell's artwork prepared people for the amazing space adventure to come. Bonestell's success lay in the fact that   _  .",

He focused on the experiences of 21 healthy Swedish boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 20. The teens kept what the authors described as \"regular working/studying hours\" and were not previously diagnosed with any particular sleep irregularity. He observed that the above-15 call group kept more irregular sleeping hours than the lower-use group,had more difficulty falling asleep,more difficulty waking up,and experienced more sleep disruptions . Bader said that among young people,a  ly recent technological invention like the cellphone has quickly become existed nearly everywhere,giving rise to considerable pressure to keep in touch. And this pressure can develop into an addiction,with serious negative results for teenager health. \"We see more and more people--especially the young generation-- who grew up with these kinds of items and gadgets in their hands,\" Bader said. \"And they become dependent on the technology. So,we have to teach young people to be structured. To know when to have the cellphone on,and when to switch it off. To avoid becoming the slave of technology,instead of the master. \" Dr. Mary Carskadon expressed little surprise with the finding. \" Interpersonal contact is one of the things that's best at keeping us awake,\" she observed. \"And so,a young person receiving cellphone texts or phone calls is going to have more deep disturbances.

Do you have the same problem? Perhaps your parents had the same problem when they were your age long ago. Why does it seem that some parents are not so friendly in their children's eyes? One of the biggest things is when someone becomes a parent, he or she likes worrying things. They worry about everything about you from the time you were born. They do a lot for you, though something would make you angry, because they care about you and worry about you. They worry about your choice of friends, the food you eat, your work at school, how much sleep you get, etc. All these things are part of your life. They want you to grow up healthily and happily. So how can you make things easier on yourself? It's easier than you think. Just make sure your parents know what you're doing. Get them to know your friends. Call them if you stay somewhere else later than usual. Say sorry to them when you make mistakes. Take responsibility for what you have done. Talk about your ideas with them. They may talk about theirs with you. Most of all, try to think about why your parents do this or do that. They are still practicing being parents and need help you can give them.

Anyone can become a better student if he or she wants to. Here's how: Plan your time carefully. When you plan your week, you should make a list of things that you have to do. After making this list, you should make a schedule of your time. First set your time for eating, sleeping, dressing, etc. Then decide a good, regular time for studying. Don't forget to set aside enough time for entertainment. A weekly schedule may not solve all your problems, but it will force you to realize what is happening to your time. Find a good place to study. Look around the house for a good study area. Keep this space, which may be a desk or simply a corner of your room, free of everything but study materials. No games, radios, or television! When you sit down to study, concentrate on the subject. Make good use of your time in class. Take advantage of class time to listen to everything the teachers say. Really listening in class means less work later. Taking notes will help you remember what the teacher says. Study regularly. When you get home from school, go over your notes, review the important points that your teacher is going to discuss the next day, read that material. This will help you understand the next class. If you do these things regularly, the material will become more meaningful, and you will remember it longer. Develop a good attitude about tests. The purpose of a test is to show what you have learned about a subject. They help you remember your new knowledge. The world won't end if you don't pass a test, so don't be over worried.

And when he looked inside, the contents brought back memories from 1946, when he apparently dropped the wallet behind the balcony bleachers   in the Baker Middle School gym. Fulton's Social Security Card and bicycle license, bearing the address where he lived during his teenage years, were positioned in their respective compartments, apparently untouched since the year after World War Il ended. Worker Nathan Osborne found the wallet -- along with old homework, lost library books and a 1964 talent show program -- while removing the bleachers for renovations on June 17. It was brought to Fulton's door the following day by Melanie Trindle, the Baker Middle School secretary. Middle School Principal Mindi Vaughan said the brown pine bleachers were connected to the gym balcony's brick wall and had remained in the same place since the school, known as the Helen M. Stack Building, opened in 1936. Fulton, 78, said he probably lost the wallet while cheering for the Baker High basketball team with a group of friends. Fulton said the bicycle ID was needed because he delivered medicine for Rodamar Drug. He was surprised, however, that his bicycle ID wasn't inside. He said he always kept it there. But rather than focus on what was inside the wallet, Fulton said the recovery has led him to reflect on his life -- one that took him to the Korean War and Berlin before the return to Baker City. He worked at Ellingson Lumber Company for 30 years, from March 1964 to April 1994. Since his retirement, Fulton has enjoyed spending time with his 11-year-old black dog, Smokey. The two often hike the nearby mountains. Trindle's knock on the door, wallet in hand, induced a slight ripple in his life, prompting him to consider the times he hadn't thought about in many years. \"Where did all the times go?\" Fulton said with a deep sigh. \"It' s hard to believe that the times have gone so fast.\" Fulton lost the wallet when  _  .",

        "question": "Space vegetables are grown from seeds   that have been taken to space and brought back to the earth. The seeds are affected by the radiation   and low gravity in space. When they are brought back to the earth, these seeds produce vegetables that are bigger and healthier than normal vegetables. However, some people worry about eating space vegetables. They think that space vegetables might not be good for us and could make us get sick because of the radiation in space. However, people should not be frightened because space vegetables are very healthy. Here are some facts that you should know about space vegetables. Space vegetables are grown from seeds that are carefully chosen. When seeds are brought back from space, they are tested to make sure that they will be safe to eat. Space vegetables are better for you than normal vegetables. For example, space tomatoes stay fresh for twenty days, which is one week longer than normal tomatoes. After genetically modified   food appeared in the market, people worried that they were eating unknown things. For example, if nut genes   are put inside potatoes, people allergic   to nuts might get sick from eating these potatoes because they do not know they are also eating nuts. Unlike genetically modified food, space vegetables have not been genetically changed. This means that no new genes are put into the vegetables. Therefore, there are no dangers of eating something unknown. According to the passage, normal tomatoes can stay fresh for about   _   days.",

It won't stand on the flower, as bees do, but just hangs to the flower and then begins to sunk   the honey from inside the flower with its needle-like beak.

        "question": "There are some strong-minded people that are able to stop smoking today and be free from the addiction the next day. However, some smokers may have to seek help from medication   in order to kick the habit.      What medication actually does is to reduce the wish to smoke. Some of the medication must be taken with a doctor's guidance. The five most common medications to stop smoking are Bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches. People can buy nicotine gum and nicotine patches in chemists. However, the other medications require a prescription.      Zyban tablets have been found to be highly effective in curing people of smoking addiction. The tablet needs to be taken whole, without crushing  it, as crushing can lead to side effects. It can be bought on the prescription of a doctor.      Nicotine patches are filled with nicotine and they are applied to the skin. The skin takes in the nicotine and carries it to the blood stream. The amount of nicotine in these patches is quite limited, not enough to lead to addiction. But you shouldn't take them for dinner. In fact, millions of people have benefited from these nicotine patches.      Nicotine gum is supposed to be a safer choice. It is used in such a way that it comes into contact with the blood vessels   in the mouth and then releases the nicotine. The nicotine should not go through the stomach; otherwise, it may cause certain side effects.      These different types of medications have to be taken quite carefully. Do ask your doctor before taking any of these. The best title for this passage is   _  .",

        "question": "Every year on my birthday, from the time I turned 12, a white gardenia  was delivered  _ to me at my house. No card or note came with it. Calls to the florist   were always in vain ---- it was a cash purchase. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's identity.  But I never stopped imagining who the anonymous sender might be.  My mother often contributed to these imaginings. She'd ask me if there was someone for whom I had done a special kindness who might be showing appreciation. Perhaps the neighbor I'd help when she was unloading a car full of groceries. Or maybe it was the old man across the street whose mail I retrieved  during the winter so he wouldn't have to venture down his icy steps.  When I was 17, a boy broke my heart. The night he called for me the last time, I cried myself to sleep. When I awoke in the morning, there was a message scribbled  on my mirror in red lipstick: \"Heartily know, when half-gods go, the gods arrive.\" I thought about that quotation from Emerson   for a long time, and I left it where my mother had written it. When I finally went to get the glass cleaner, my mother knew everything was all right again. I don't remember ever slamming  my door in anger at her and shouting, \"You just don't understand!\" because she did understand.     One month before my high-school graduation, my father died suddenly of a heart attack. My feelings ranged from grief to abandonment, fear and over-whelming anger that my dad was missing some of the most important events in my life. I became completely uninterested in my upcoming graduation, the senior-class play and the prom-events  that I had worked on and looked forward to.  But my mother, in the midst of her own grief, would not hear of my missing out any of those things. The day before my father died, she and I had gone shopping for a prom dress and found a spectacular  one. Wearing it made me feel like a princess, but it was the wrong size, and when my father died the next day, I forgot all about the dress. My mother didn't. The day before the prom, I found that dress-in the right size, draped over the living room sofa, presented to me -- beautifully, artistically and lovingly. I didn't care about having a new dress, but my mother did. She wanted her children to feel loved and lovable, creative and imaginative. My mother died when I was 22, only ten days after I was married. That was the year the gardenias stopped coming. We can infer from the passage that  _  .",

When a cat is frightened, its heart starts beating faster, its muscles get tense, and there are changes in the chemicals in its bloodstream.Although the cat doesn't realize this, its body is getting ready for action.If the danger continues, the animal will do one of two things.It will defend itself, or it will run away as fast as it can. Something like this also happens to people.When we are excited, angry, scared, or aroused by other emotions (feelings), our bodies go through many physical changes.Our hearts beat faster, and our muscles get tense.All of these changes make us more alert and ready to react.We, too.get ready to defend ourselves or run. Human beings, however, have a problem that animals never face.If we give way to our feelings and let them take over, we can get into trouble.Have you ever said something in anger --or hit somebody--and regretted it later? Have you ever shouted at a teacher, told somebody you were lonely, or said you were in love, and then wished later you had kept your mouth shut? It isn't always clever to express your feelings freely. Does this mean that it's smarter always to hide our feelings? No! If you keep feelings of anger, sadness, and bitterness hidden away or bottled up inside, your body stays tense.Physical illness can develop.It can actually be bad for your health.(It isn't good to keep pleasant feelings inside either; all feelings need to be expressed.) Feelings that you keep all bottled up inside don't just go away.It's as if you bought some bananas and stuck them in a cupboard.You might not be able to see them.but before long you' d smell them.And if you opened the cupboard, chances are that you'd see little fruit flies flying all over them.They'd be rotten. You can try to treat emotions as if they were bananas in the cupboard.You can hide them and you can pretend they don't exist, but they'll still be around.And at last you'll have to deal with them.just like those bananas.

During this time he had developed a love for basketball. Sadly, because of my work over the last twelve months, I had only been able to attend a few of his games; however, I was determined to get to his last game for the school term. Tom's team came out in the first 10 minutes with a burst of goals that saw them leading by just over 20 points at the end of the first half. The second half changed as the other team quickly played themselves back into the game. Tom's team started to miss an increasing number of shots. It was at that point that the coach called his first time out. The noise of the spectators   became quiet as the coach spoke to them. He had the team standing in a half circle, but he squatted   down, looking up at them and fiving some very calm and clear instructions on what they needed to do in the last couple of minutes. As he stood up to allow the team to return to the court, I saw him give some further words of encouragement to all of them. You could see that he knew that the team was fighting to save the game and that he needed to lift them up. By squatting down he placed himself in a position where he was talking up to them, rather than down or at them, and as the players went back onto the court his words of encouragement served to lift their energy and spirits. Well, Tom's team went on to win the final by 5 points. As I drove away I thought about what can happen to us all in our everyday life. One of my favourite quotes is about the half filled glass of water --- \"Is it half full or is it half empty?\" Like the coach, the answer to this quote all depends on how you look at things.

        "question": "Decisions, decisions! Our lives are full of them, from the small ones to the life-changing. The right to choose is central to everyone. Yet sometimes we make bad decisions that leave us unhappy or full of regret. Can science help? Most of us know little about the mental processes that lie behind our decisions. Luckily, what psychologists are finding may help us all make better choices. Here are some of their amazing discoveries to help you make up your mind. Consider your emotions. You might think that emotions are the enemy of decision making, but in fact they're a part of it. Whenever you make up your mind, your brain's emotional center is active. University of Southern California scientist, Antonio Damasio, has studied people with damage to only the emotional parts of their brains, and found that they were unable to make basic choices about what to wear or eat. Damasio thinks this may be because our brains store emotional memories of past choices, which we use to help the present decision making. However, making choices under the influence of an emotion can greatly affect the result. Take anger, for example. A study by Nitika Garg of the University of Mississippi and other scientists found the angry shoppers were more likely to choose the first thing they were offered rather than considering other choices. It seems anger can lead us to make quick decisions without much thinking. All emotions affect our thinking and motivation , so it may be best to avoid making important decisions under their influence. Yet strangely there's one emotion that seems to help us make good choices. The American researchers found that sad people took time to consider the various choices on offer, and ended up making the best choices. In fact many studies show that people who feel unhappy have the most reasonable view of the world. What do we learn from the text?",

        "question": "Many students are under great pressure this term. There is some advice on studying and preparing for exams. Sciences Ask students what is the most difficult course, and most of them will give you the same answer: mathematics. This is also true for Dai Shuang, a 14-year-old student at No.1 Middle School. He says, \"It's so difficult that I get a headache whenever I think about the math exam.\" According to Dai, studying this course is not easy. He usually studies math by himself and spends most of his free time reading math books and doing exercises.  _  Qin Xia, a math teacher, offers some advice. \"Most students fear mathematics because they think the class is too difficult or boring.\" he says, \"These students don't listen carefully in classes or even sleep.\" In Qin's opinion, they can try to take notes. And they'd better ask teachers for help. It's difficult for students to teach themselves math, which will waste a lot of time. Besides, doing a lot of exercises is also important. Arts Zhu Tianjiao, a 13-year-old student at Megan Middle School, is very nervous because she doesn't know how to improve her English.  _  Xia Bingcong, a top student at Tsinghua University shares  some of her learning experiences.

When they are red hot they are very angry about something. The small hot tasting peppers found in many Mexican foods are called red hots for their color and their fiery taste. Pink is a lighter kind of color. People sometimes say they are in the pink when they are in good health. It probably comes from the fact that many babies are born with a nice pink color that shows that they are in good health. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blues music in the United States is the opposite of red hot music. Blues is slow, sad and soulful. Someone who is blue is very sad. The color green is natural for trees and grass. But it is an unnatural color for humans. A person who has a sick stomach may say he feels a little green. A passenger on a boat who is feeling very sick from high waves may look very green. If a person is green at his job, he may be a newcomer and inexperienced. Sometimes a person may be upset because he does not have something as nice as a friend has, like a new sports car. That person may say he is green with envy. Some people are green with envy because their friend has more dollars. The color black is used often in expressions.

        "question": "Ghostwriters are widely used by celebrities or public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies  . The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to significant. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent   writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a \"how-to\" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, and an outline, interviews with the celebrity or public figure. The credited authors also indicate to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or \"voice\" they want in the book. Celebrity books are usually ghostwritten in the first person (I did this and that) or the third person (David Pardon asked the group to recommend someone etc.). In some cases, such as with some \"how-to\" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this methodto increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates employ ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of John F. Kennedy's books were almost entirely ghostwritten. Former President Ronald Reagan also released a ghostwritten autobiography. A consultant or career-switcher may pay to have a book ghostwritten on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance their credibility as an \"expert\" in their field. For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become an inspiring speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published in the vanity press, which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to potential clients   as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores. It is implied in the passage that   _  .",

        "question": "The British psychoanalyst John Bowlby maintains that separation from the parents during the sensitive \"attachment\" period from birth to three may scar a child's personality and lead to emotional problems in later life. Some people have drawn the conclusion from Bowlby's work that children should not be subjected to day care before the age of three because of the parental separation it causes, and many people do believe this. But there are also arguments against such a strong conclusion. Firstly, anthropologists point out that the insulated love affair between children and parents found in modern societies does not usually exist in traditional societies. For example, in some tribal societies, such as the Ngoni, the father and mother of a child did not bring up their infant alone - far from it. Secondly, common sense tells us that day care would not be so widespread today if parents, care-takers found children had problems with it. Statistical studies of this kind have not yet been carried out, and even if they were, the results would be certain to be complicated and controversial. Thirdly, in the last decade, there have been a number of careful American studies of children in day care, and they have uniformly reported that day care had a neutral or slightly positive effect on children's development. But tests that have had to be used to measure this development are not widely enough accepted to settle the issue. But Bowlby's analysis raises the possibility that early day care has delayed effects. The possibility that such care might lead to, say, more mental illness or crime 15 or 20 years later can only be explored by the use of statistics. Whatever the long-term effects, parents sometimes find the immediate effects difficult to deal with. Children under three are likely to protest at leaving their parents and show unhappiness. At the age of three or three and a half almost all children find the transition to nursery easy, and this is undoubtedly why more and more parents make use of child care at this time. The matter, then, is far from clear-cut, though experience and available evidence indicate that early care is reasonable for infants. Which of the following statements is NOT against Bowlby's theory?",

        "question": "We like to think our intelligence is self-made; it happens inside our heads, the product of our inner thoughts alone. But the rise of Google, Wikipedia and other online tools has made many people question the impact of these technologies on our brains. Is typing in \"Who has played James Bond in the movies?\" the same as our knowledge about the names like Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig? Can we say we know the answer as long as we know how to rapidly get the information on Google? Here the question is about how we define intelligence itself. The answer appears to be interesting, because the evidence from psychological studies suggests that much of our intelligence comes from how we coordinate ourselves with other people and our environment. An influential theory among psychologists is that we're cognitive misers . This is the idea that we are unwilling to do mental work unless we have to. We try to avoid thinking things fully when a short cut is available. If you've ever voted for the presidential candidate  with the most honest smile, or chosen a restaurant based on how many people are already sitting in there, then you are a cognitive miser. The theory explains why we'd much rather type a zip code into Google Maps than memorize and recall the location of a place - it's so much easier to do so. Research shows that people don't tend to rely on their memories for things they can easily access. Buildings can somehow disappear from pictures we're looking at, or the people we're talking to can be changed with someone else, and often we won't notice - a phenomenon called \"change blindness\". This isn't an example of human stupidity - far from it, in fact - this is an example of mental efficiency. The mind relies on the world as a better record than memory. Philosophers have suggested that thinking is really happening in the environment as much as it is happening in our brains. The philosopher Andy Clark called humans \"natural born cyborgs \", those naturally capable of absorbing and combining new tools, ideas and abilities. In Clark's view, the route to a solution is not the issue - having the right tools really does mean you know the answers, just as much as already knowing the answer. Rather than being forced to rely on our own resources for everything, we can share our knowledge. Technology keeps track of things for us so we don't have to, while large systems of knowledge serve the needs of society as a whole. I don't know how a computer works, or how to grow vegetables, but that knowledge is out there and I can get to benefit. The internet provides even more potential to share this knowledge. Wikipedia is one of the best examples - an increasingly large database of knowledge from which everyone can benefit. So as well as having a physical environment - like the rooms or buildings we live or work in - we also have a mental environment, which means that when I ask you where your mind is, you shouldn't point toward the centre of your forehead. As research shows, our minds are made up just as much by the people and tools around us as they are by the brain cells inside our skull. Which of the following might the philosopher Andy Clark agree with?",

        "question": "If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different. If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses. Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses' convention, of a story which works well because the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his food and stomps over to a table by himself. \"Who is that?\" the new arrival asked St. Peter. \"Oh, that's God.\" came the reply, \"but sometimes he thinks he's a doctor.\" If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it'll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman's notorious bad taste in ties. With other audiences you mustn't attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman. You will be on safer ground if you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system. If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural. Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and unforced manner. Often it's the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you are making a light-hearted remark. Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote \"If at first you don't succeed, give up\" or a play on words or on a situation.

So, when we are watching a 3D movie, our brain can't put together the images sent to our eyes. The brain needs to work harder at \"reading\" the images. That makes it easier for people with eye problems to get dizzy   or have headaches.

We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \"the library lady\" or just \"the helper\". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed.

So it came as no surprise to learn that researchers believe crying and laughing come from the same part of the brain. Just as laughing has many health advantages, scientists are discovering that so, too, does crying. Whatever it takes for us to reduce pressure is important to our emotional   health, and a study found that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men report feeling better after crying. Besides, tears attract help from other people. Researchers agree that when we cry, people around us become kinder and friendly and they are more ready to provide support and comfort. Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we' re very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them. Just as crying can be healthy, not crying -- holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering -- can be bad for physical   health, Studies have shown that too much control of emotions can lead to high blood pressure, heart problems and some other illnesses.

Jessica's 11-year-old sister, Emma, admits she's used the web to write bad things about another girl, though she regrets it now. \"After a while, you may feel like, how could I have been so mean? Or, why did I do that?\" she says. Experts say gossip on the Internet can be more harmful than the old fashioned kind. It lasts longer and is taken more seriously. And, unlike ugly words on the bathroom wall, there's no way to get rid of it. If your kids are victims  of online gossip, Dr. Commanday suggests putting the gossip in to perspective  . \"Point out to them how what's being said on the screen differs from what everyone knows about you as a person,\" Dr. Commanday says. You can also try what worked from Emma: keep your kids off the offensive   website! \"When she was using it all the time, her name was there all the time. People were writing things about her,\" explains Patti Thrift, Emma's mother, \"Since she has no longer had access to that, she's no longer a topic of conversation.\" The purpose of the passage is to   _  .",

From morning till night, he had a number of clear duties, for which Williams had patiently trained him and, like a good pupil, Prince lived for the chance to prove his abilities. When Williams wanted to put on his boots, he would murmur. \"Boots\" and within seconds the dog would drop them at his feet. At nine every morning Prince ran off to the general store in the village, returning shortly not only with Williams' daily paper but with a packet of Williams' favorite tobacco. A trained gun-dog, Prince had a large soft mouth specially evolved (;) for the sake of carrying hunted creatures, so the paper and tobacco came to no harm, never even showing a tooth mark.        Williams was an engine driver, and he had to work at irregular times -- \"days\", \"late days\", or \"nights\". Over the years Prince got to know these periods of work and rest, and knew when his master would leave the house and return and _ If Williams overslept, Prince barked at the bedroom door until he woke. On his return, Williams' slippers were brought to him, the paper and tobacco too.        A curious thing happened to Williams during the snow and ice of last winter. One evening he slipped and fell on the icy pavement somewhere between the village and his home. He was so badly shaken that he stayed in bed for three days; and not until he got up and dressed again did he discover that he had lost his wallet containing over fifty pounds. The house was turned upside down in the search, but the wallet was not found. However, two days later, Prince dropped the wallet into Williams' hand.

        "question": "By far the most common difficulty in study is simple failure to get down to regular concentrated work . This difficulty is much greater for those who do not work to a plan and have no regular routine of study . Many students muddle along , doing a bit of this subject or that , as the mood takes them , or letting their set work pile up until the last possible moment . Few students work to a set timetable . They say that if they did work out a timetable for themselves they would not keep to it , or would have to change it frequently , since they can never predict from one day to the next what their activities will be . No doubt some students take much more kindly to a regular routine than others . There are many who shy away from a self-controlled weekly timetable , and dislike being tied down to a fixed program of work . Many able students state that they work in cycles . When they become interested in a topic they work on it attentively for three or four days at a time . On other days they avoid work completely . It has to be admitted that we do not fully understand the motivation to work . Most people over 25 years of age have become used to a work routine , and the majority of really productive workers set aside regular hours for the more important areas of their work . The \" tough-minded \" school of workers doesn't fully accept the idea that good work can only be done naturally , under the influence of inspiration  . Those who believe that they need only work and study  _ have a mistaken belief either in their own talent or in the value of \" freedom \" . Freedom from control and discipline leads to unhappiness rather than to \" self-expression \" or \" personality development \" .

Within a few blocks, craving another drink, he stopped his car in the middle of the street, picked up a brick, and broke the display window of a liquor store.

        "question": "Exhausted and unhappy, you still have to squeeze a smile to your friends, or teachers. That's just life, you may think. But new research suggests that putting on a fake smile can worsen people's mood and even lower work efficiency. Lead researcher Brent Scott with other researchers studied a group of bus drivers for two weeks. They tried to find out what happened when the drivers were involved in \"surface acting\" or fake smiling, and the opposite, \"deep acting\" which means people put on real smiles by recalling pleasant memories or thinking about their current situation more positively. The results showed that on days when drivers were forced to smile, they felt depressed and didn't want to work. On days when they smiled due to positive thoughts, their mood improved a lot as well as their work efficiency. The research goes against the popular belief among companies that employees should be cheerful to customers at all times. They include employees of shops, banks, call center workers and others who have face-to-face contact with members of the public. \"Smiling for the sake of  smiling can lead to emotional exhaustion and coldness, and that's bad for the organization,\" Scott told the Daily Mail. The study also showed that women were harmed more by fake smiling than men. Their mood and work performance both worsened more. But they were helped more by deep acting -- their mood became better and they worked more efficiently. However, while deep acting seemed to improve mood in the short term, Scott says it's not a long-term solution for unhappiness. \"There have been some suggestions that if you do this over a long period that you start to feel inauthentic ,\" Scott said. \"You may be trying to cultivate positive emotions, but at the end of the day you may not feel like yourself anymore.\" According to the article, which of the following statements about \"fake smiling\" is TRUE?",

As my mom and I headed towards the restaurant from our car, a girl about my age and her mother came up to us. They asked if we had any spare change. My mom immediately asked where they kept their things. They pointed to an old car in a parking across the street. The girl said there were six of them living in that car, which was the same size as my own family. My mom said she had something to do after handing the people a few dollars. She sent me inside the restaurant with my dad and my three siblings. But she didn't come. Later, I found out she had gone home and practically emptied our cupboards into a few bags. Then, she brought that food over to the car and handed the bags to the family. I wasn't there when that part happened, but I can only imagine the joy it brought to their faces. A few days later, when I actually found out about what she had done, I asked her why she helped those people. She told me that they were not lucky. I remember the face of that girl who had asked us for change, she was the same age as me, yet we looked so different. Here I stood, dressed in almost new clothes, headed to dine in a restaurant and then back home to the bedroom I shared with my younger sister. I remember thinking that the other girl didn't have any food to eat. and she was heading back to a cold car shared with five other people.

        "question": "I have been very lucky to have won the Nobel Prize twice. It is, of course, very exciting to have such an important recognition of my work, but the real pleasure was in the work itself. Scientific research is like an exploration of a voyage of discovery. You are continually trying out new things that have not been done before. Many of them will lead nowhere and you have to try something different, but sometimes an experiment does work and tells you something new and that is really exciting. However small the new finding may be, it is great to think \" I am the only person who knows this\" and then you will have the fun of thinking what this finding will lead to and deciding what will be the next experiment. One of the best things about scientific research is that you are always doing something different and it is never boring. There are good times when things go well and bad times when they don't. Some people get discouraged at the difficult times but when I have a failure, my policy has always been not to worry but to start planning the next experiment, which is always fun. It is very exciting to make a new discovery. Some people will do the strangest things for this excitement, such as going round the world in a balloon or walking to the North Pole. There are not many new places to explore but there is a lot of new information to be discovered in science and a journey into this unknown area can be much more worthwhile and just as exciting. I am sometimes asked, \"What do you have to do to win a Nobel Prize?\" My answer is: \"I don't know. I have never tried.\" But I know of one way not to win one. There are some people whose main reason for doing science is to win prizes and they are always thinking about how to do it. Such people don't succeed. To do good science you must be interested in it and enjoy doing experiments and thinking out problems. And, of course, you must be prepared to work hard and not to be too discouraged by failure.

She was born in Virginia but was brought up in an orphanage in Yonkers, New York. Chick Webb _ her in an amateur competition when she was sixteen.

He could not hear or speak. Sometimes people pitied him and gave him food and clothing. If not, he ate what he could find in garbage cans.     It is said that a man named Craig found the little boy and took him to Dr. E. M. Gallaudet at Gallaudet College. Dr Gallaudet gave him the first name of Douglas, and the last name of Craig, after the man who found him.     Dr Gallaudet placed Douglas in the Kendall School, and he stayed there until he was old enough to work. He spent his life working in and around the halls of Gallaudet.     Once he courted   a black woman from Baltimore. Since his courtship required letter-writing, and he was illiterate, he had a student in the college act as his \"private secretary\". Though that relationship did not work out, he did finally marry. Later, he married a black deaf woman from Washington D.C. The wedding and reception took place in a church near the college.     The happy couple went to Baltimore for a honeymoon, but the honeymoon only lasted for one day. Their plans were cut short when Douglas's pocketbook containing about $300 was either lost or stolen.     Douglas never got very far from Washington D.C. and Gallaudet College was his world.

        "question": "To be able to motivate oneself, or self-motivate, occurs when a person has the willingness to do something and is internally  motivated to do it. Sometimes it's very difficult to get ourselves moving.The natural tendency is to postpone.Life just seems to get in the way! There is a job to go to, groceries to do, television to watch--whoops! I guess we get pretty good at finding excuses to escape getting started on goals like an exercise routine or reading a new book.The fact is that we are creatures of routine and habit.So what can we do to motivate ourselves to accomplish our goals? Here are some tips on how to get moving: Decide what you want.It's hard to motivate an aimless mind.Set a goal and decide how you are going to go about it.Then break it down into smaller sections so it's easier to handle and less overwhelming.  Keep track of your progress.Keep a log or journal where you can measure how much you have accomplished.Looking at it can also motivate you to keep pushing ahead. Post motivating pictures or slogans within your sight.It is always inspiring to see pictures of people who have accomplished what you're going for.It makes it attainable and realistic.Likewise, little slogans like \"go for it\" or \"just do it\" can give you the little support you need.  _ .If you remind yourself to go for the desired promotion, it will re-establish why you are doing what you're doing. Make it a habit.Once you have accomplished your objective, e.g.becoming an early riser, keep it up so that it's second nature to you and you don't have to think about it anymore.

        "question": "There is no denying that over the years college education has been accepted without the slightest doubt. All high school graduates should go, says conventional wisdom and statistical evidence, because college will help them earn more, become \"better\" citizens and be more responsible than those who don't go. But college can never work its magic for everyone. Now with half our high school graduates attending college, those unfit for the pattern are getting more. College graduates are selling shoes and driving taxis; college students interfere with each other's experiments and write false letters of recommendation in the fierce competition for admission into graduate schools. Others find no stimulation   in their studies, and consequently have to drop out, which is often encouraged by college administrators. Some observers say the fault lies with young people themselves --- they are spoiled and expecting too much. But that's a condemnation  of the students as a whole, and doesn't explain all campus unhappiness. Others blame our society. Both are partly right. We have been told that young people have to go to college because our economy can't absorb an army of untrained eighteen-year-olds. But disappointed graduates are learning that it can no longer absorb an army of trained twenty-two-year-olds, either. Some campus watchers suggest that college may not be the best, the proper or the only place for every young person after finishing high school. It seems that through the rosy   glow of our own college experiences, we may have been looking at those surveys and statistics upside down. Perhaps college does not make people intelligent, ambitious, happy, or quick to learn things--maybe _ . Intelligent, ambitious, happy, quick-learning people are merely those who are attracted to college in the first place. And perhaps all those successful college graduates would have been successful even without college education. This is heresy   to those who have been brought up to believe that if a little schooling is good, more has to be much better. But contrary evidence is beginning to pile up.

Traditional heroes are no longer sought after anymore. Today, it's unconventional leading figure -like Francis J. Underwood from \"House of Cards\" who are winning audiences' hearts. The political drama, which airs on the Internet service Netflix, has won the applauses of viewers around the world since its debut  on February 1, 2013. And it has caught the attention of real politicians, including US President Barack Obama. Kevin Spacey plays Francis J. Underwood, a cold-blooded Democrat who moves his way up the political ladder by any means necessary. He often uses his under-exposure in media to carry out misdeeds that will later benefit him. The revenge  theme plays a heavy role throughout the storyline, Underwood, who had high hopes for an appointment as Secretary of State in the first season, was betrayed by the US President and his former colleagues. He and his wife then conducted a plan of revenge and swore to unseat those who turned their backs against him. Through their plan, Underwood's own hunger for power grew and empowered him to get rid of whoever stood in his Way. The release of the trailer  of the second season excited millions of viewers around the world, including US President Barack Obama, who has been a loyal fan since the series debuted. Obama expressed his admiration for Underwood. \"This guy's getting a lot of stuff done,\" he said. Although the President is anxious to watch the story unfold, he'd like to do it at his own pace. After the release of the second season on February 14, 2014, Obama sent words on his Twitter account, \"Tomorrow: @HouseOfCards. No spoilers , please.\" The second season has promised to be darker, with more unexpected turnouts, and is to include more Chinese elements. \"Perhaps the team, including myself, has realized that in the next decade, Asia will be an extensively important region, and China will play an active role in its transition and change,\" says Spacey.

        "question": "Shakespeare's life can be divided into three periods: the first 20 years in Stratford, which includes his schooling,early marriage, and fatherhood;the next 25 years as an actor and playwright   in London; and the last five in retirement back in Stratford where he enjoyed the wealth gained from his theatrical   successes. The years linking the first two periods are marked by a lack of information about Shakespeare, and are often referred to as the \"dark years\". Shakespeare probably left school at 15, and took some sorts of jobs, especially since this was the period of his father's financial difficulty. A great number of references in his plays suggest that William may have in fact worked for his father, thus gaining specialized knowledge. At some point during the \"dark years\", Shakespeare began his career with a London theatrical company -- perhaps in 1589 -- for he was already an actor and playwright in 1592. Shakespeare apparently wrote and acted for Pembroke's Men, as well as a lot of others, in particular Strange's Men, which later became the Chamberlain's Men. When, in 1592, the theaters were closed for about two years, due to a terrible disease. Shakespeare turned to writing book-length poetry. Most _ were Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, both of which have been translated into many languages and even been included in students' textbooks. During this same period, Shakespeare was writing his sonnets  , which are more likely signs of the time's fashion rather than actual love poems detailing any particular relationship. He returned to play writing when theater reopened in 1594, and published no more poetry. His sonnets were published without his permission in 1609, shortly before his retirement. His final play was Henry VIII, two years before his death in 1616. According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true?",

His parents were very clever mice and often said to their son, \"Always wait before you go for a piece of cheese.\" So the young mouse waited quietly. Then he heard a quiet \"Miaow\" and he knew the cat was there. He stayed in the hole and said to himself, \"I'm glad I listened to my parents and learned to wait.\" The next day, he looked out again. He put his nose out of the hole, and the beautiful smell of cheese came to his nose again. He could see the cheese. It was only a few centimetres away. But he sat still and waited quietly. This time he did not hear any cat's noise. Instead he heard a very quiet \"Woof, woof.\" \"It's a dog!\" he thought. \"If the dog is there, the cat won't be there.

The best available evidence suggests that climate changes since the 1970s may already be causing over 150,000 deaths annually, and that greenhouse gas emissions would increase disease burdens  in  the  coming  decades.The  risks  are concentrated in the poorest population, who have contributed least to the problem. The Kyoto Protocol   is signed by 128 nations,and commits the participating industrialized countries to cutting emissions of greenhouse gases by over 5% below 1990 level by the period of 20082012. \"Over 600 thousand people died in weatherrelated disasters in the 1990s.Temperature and rainfall influence the rates of diseases and infections including malaria,and malnutrition,which together cause over 3.5 million deaths a year.The Kyoto Protocol is the first step towards protecting the climate system,which exerts such a strong influence on our health\",said Dr Kerstin Leitner,Assistant DirectorGeneral for Sustainable Development and Healthy Environments. While acting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is also essential to protect vulnerable   communities from the effects of climate changes.WHO works to promote measures such as protection from malaria and other climate sensitive diseases, and reliable access to clean water and sanitation, for people  in the  most vulnerable developing countries.Increasing disease control efforts will also help to protect current and future generations from the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.

But all too often we convey to our children either by words or by actions that failure is something to be ashamed of, that nothing but top performance meets our approval. Donnie was my youngest third-grader. His fear of failure kept him from classroom games that other children played excitedly. He seldom answered questions - he might be wrong. He seldom finished his work because he repeatedly checked with me to be sure he hadn't made a mistake. I tried my best to build his self-confidence. But nothing changed until midterm, when Mary Anne, a student teacher, was assigned to our classroom. She was young and pretty, and she loved children. My pupils, Donnie included, adored her. But even enthusiastic, loving Mary was _ by this little boy who feared he might make a mistake. Then one morning we were working math problems. Donnie had copied the problems with painstaking neatness and filled in answers for the first row. Pleased with his progress, I left the children with Mary. But when I returned, Donnie was in tears. He'd missed the third problem. Mary looked at me in despair. Suddenly her face brightened. From the desk we shared, she got a canister   filled with pencils. \"Look, Donnie,\" she said, \"I've got something to show you.\" She removed the pencils and placed them on his desk. \"See these pencils, Donnie?\" she continued. \"They belong to Mrs. Lindstrom and me. See how the erasers are worn? That's because we make mistakes too. Lots of them. But we erase the mistakes and try again. That's what you must learn to do, too.\" She kissed him and continued: \"I'll leave one of these pencils on your desk so you'll remember that everybody makes mistakes, even teachers.\" Donnie looked up with love in his eyes and just a glimmer   of a smile. The pencil became Donnie's prized possession.

To test how much dreams can help learning, Robert Stickgold had some students play a shape-fitting game called Tetris   for a few hours and then go to sleep. Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes. Interestingly, the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most. Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream, many important tasks are getting done. The brain decides what to keep and what to forget. It is connecting new experiences to older learning. In fact, the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions . At night, emotions are in the driver's seat. People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward. Often the dream event changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset. So if your best friend moves away, you might dream that you're the one who's moving. In fact, dreams have a proven power to improve mood, and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't.

While ocean warming has been the primary focus for scientists and ocean policy managers, cold events can also whiten corals. A new study by scientists compared damaged to corals exposed to heat as well as cold stress. The results show that cool temperatures can cause more damage in the short term, but heat is more destructive  in the long run. Climate change is widely known to produce warming conditions in the oceans, but extreme cold-water events have become more frequent and serious as well. In 2010, for example, coral reefs around the world faced on of the coldest winters and one of the hottest summers on record. During a unique experiment, corals under cold temperatures suffered greater damage in just days compared with heat treated corals. Yet the researchers found that corals were eventually able to adjust to the cold conditions, make their health stable and continue to grow. However, over the long term corals subjected to heat suffered more greatly than those in cold, with evidence of severe whitening and growth stoppage, which leads to death. The coral's ability to adjust to cool temperatures surprised the researchers, who say the study's results show the complexities  of monitoring coral health in response to different environmental factors . \"Global warming is associated with increases but also decreases of temperatures,\" said Deheyn, one of the researchers. \"Not much has been known about the comparative effects of temperature decrease on corals.

But a recent survey has showed that such ambitions lack the required support and remain just that -- dreams. The Shanghai Municipal Employment Promotion Center poll of 1,276 graduates in several universities and colleges in the city, released last Friday, showed 59.78 percent of respondents considered the possibility of setting up a company or at least a small store. \"But they just stop at the 'thinking' stage,\" it stated. Respondents put the top reasons for not going it alone down to a shortage of investment and a lack of business opportunity. They also listed lack of business experience and social networks, the need for advanced study and objections from family members as factors that stood in their way. More than 90 percent of the interviewees said they would rather take up a job after graduating and then consider starting their own business two or three years down the road. Guo Bing, a senior student in Shanghai International Studies University majoring in English, decided he wanted to be his own boss last year. But he is looking for a job first. \"If I fail to find a satisfying job, I would like to establish a company in exhibition services,\" Guo said. The Shanghai native has some relatives working in a local printing plant. With their help, Guo hopes to produce exhibition brochures at a relatively low price. He is also confident that his English language skills can help him do well in the industry. \"Social networking is an important factor leading to business success,\" Guo said. Guo said that the shortage of graduate jobs is the main reason driving more university students to set up a business right after their graduation. Jiang said the university sets up a business guide team made of government officials and professionals. They regularly give training courses to students who show an interest in having their own business.

        "question": "When I was 15, I had an enemy, a girl who liked to point out my short-comings . Week by week her list grew. I was skinny , I talked too loud, I was too proud, and so on. I put up with her as long as I could. At last, I ran to my father in tears and anger. He listened to my outburst quietly. They he asked, \"Are the things she says the true or not?\"True? I wanted to know how to strike back. What did truth have to do with it? \"Mary, didn't you ever wonder what you are really like? Well, you now have that girl's opinion. \"Go and make a list of every thing she said and mark the points that are true. You needn't pay attention to the other things she said. I did as he told me and discovered to my surprise that about half the things are true. Some of them I couldn't change(like being skinny), but a good number I could and suddenly wanted to change. For the time in my life I began to get a quiet clear picture of myself. I brought the list back to Daddy, but he wouldn't take it.\"That's just for you,\"he said.\"You know better than any else the truth about yourself, once you hear it. But you've got to learn to listen, not close your ears in anger or hurt. When someone says something about you, you'll know if it's true or not. If it is ,you'll find it will echo inside you.\" \"I still don't think it very nice of her to talk about me in front of everybody.\" \"Mary, there is one way you could stop others talking about you ever again, and criticizing  you--just say nothing and do nothing. But then, if you do that, you'd find you were nothing. You wouldn't like that now, would you?\"\"No, I admitted \" The writer found that  _  .",

Before he left home,his wife said,\"Now you have all these things. You need them on your way. Take care of your things on the way.\" He went to the station. He bought a ticket and got on the train with it. About an hour later,the conductor began to see the tickets. He came to the old man and said,\"Will you please show me your ticket?\" The old man looked for his ticket in all his pockets but he could not find it. He was very worried.\"I can't find my ticket. I really bought a ticket before I got on the train \"said the old man. \"I think you are right. I believe you bought a ticket. All right,you don't have to buy another ticket \"said the conductor kindly. But the old man still  looked worried and said sadly,\"You don't know why I'm worried.
