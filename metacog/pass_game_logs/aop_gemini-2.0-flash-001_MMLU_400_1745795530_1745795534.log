Question 220/400:
For some minutes, all was quiet in the street. Then from across the street someone came walking. It looked like a man of middle height, dressed in a big raincoat, a soft hat and rubber-soled boots or shoes, and making little sound while walking. No one was in sight. It was a street with two rows of about fifty small houses and there were three lamps on either side. The lamp nearest to the child's house could be seen clearly, but the others were almost hidden by the smoky air. A car passed the end of the street and its lights showed faintly,but clearly enough to show the smooth skin of a woman's face. The car disappeared as the woman, wrapped up in her coat, reached the doorway of the child's house. She put a key in the lock quickly, pushed the door open and stepped inside, then closed the door without looking round. She began to breathe hard. She leaned against the door for a moment, then straightened up as if with an effort, and walked towards the door of the front room, the passage leading to the kitchen, and the narrow staircase. She hesitated outside the door, then went up the stairs quickly but with hardly a sound. There was enough light from the narrow hall to show the four doors leading off a small landing . She pushed each door open in turn and shone a torch inside, and the light fell upon beds, walls, furniture, a bathroom hand-basin, a mirror which flashed brightness back; but this was not what the woman was looking for. She turned away and went downstairs, and hesitated again at the foot of the stairs, then turned towards the kitchen. Clearly there was nothing there, or in the small washroom that she wanted. Two rooms remained; the front room and a smaller one next to it. She opened the front room door. After a moment, she saw the child's bed and the child. Once she was in the house, the woman behaved as if what she was looking for   _
----------
  A: might be in the kitchen
  B: was more likely to be upstairs
  C: would be easily seen by the light from the hall
  D: would look frightening to a child

Question 223/400:
My Garden -----by Nelson Mandela In early 1977, the authorities   announced the physical labour and arranged some kind of work for us to do in the courtyard. The free time also allowed me to hunt what became two of my favorite hobbies in Robben Island---gardening and tennis. To survive in prison, one must develop ways to take satisfaction in one's daily life. One can feel fulfilled   by washing one's clothes so that they are particularly clean. Just as one takes pride in important tasks outside of prison, one can find the same pride in doing small things inside prison. Almost from the beginning of my sentence on Robben Island, I asked the authorities for permission to start a garden in the courtyard. For years, they refused without offering a reason. But finally they gave in, and we were able to cut out a small garden in the prison. The soil in the courtyard was dry and rocky. In order to start my garden, I had to remove a great many rocks to allow the plant room to grow. The authorities supplied me with seeds. At first, I planned tomatoes and onions, because these plants did not require rich earth or constant care. The early harvests were poor, but they soon improved. I began to order books on gardening. I studied different gardening techniques and types of fertilizers  . For a time, I tried to grow peanuts, and used different soils and fertilizers, but finally I gave up. It was one of my few failures. A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could control. The processes of planting a seed, watching it grow, taking care of it and then harvesting it offered a simple but long-lasting satisfaction. The sense of being the owner of the small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom. Hard as he tried, he failed   _   at last.
----------
  A: to get a sense of satisfaction and freedom
  B: to grow tomatoes and onions
  C: to grow peanuts
  D: to get the same pride inside prison.

Question 225/400:
It was one of the happiest times of my life. I was 29 and had just received my bachelor's degree, graduating with honors despite working two jobs and being a wife and mother. My parents and five - year - old son were in the audience when I walked onto the stage at prefix = st1 /AshlandUniversityto get my diploma. I was so excited and proud to be starting a teaching career and contributing more to my family's well - being. But when I got home that evening, there was a note from my husband written on the back of an envelope. It basically said he'd come to get his clothes and wouldn't be back. We'd been having trouble, but the finality of that note still came as a shock. He had emptied our bank account. We were horribly in debt. I had quit my previous jobs in expectation of interviewing for a teaching position. I was embarrassed, scared, and angry and felt I had failed. But I had my son, and I was about to bring a new life into the world, so despite my deep sadness, I had to go on. The next morning, I woke up, put my feet on the floor, took a deep breath, fixed breakfast, and basically did everything I always did. I used my routine to keep me moving. One small step after one small step was the way I bounced back. And in the seven years since, I've continued moving forward. I got a job as a kindergarten teacher, earned a master' s degree in education. I certainly would never have chosen to put them through this, but I'm glad it happened to me when looking back. It helped me find my voice and myself a lot sooner. It helped me grow independent, confident, and strong--things I' m hopefully developing gradually now in my child. The passage mainly wants to teach us   _  .
----------
  A: how to learn from failure
  B: how to become a good woman
  C: how to earn a master' s degree
  D: how to bring up our children

Question 226/400:
What's the meaning of "dark horse"? It's someone who wins when no one expects it. Han Xiaopeng took China's first gold on snow. He became an Olympic "dark horse" by winning the gold medal in men's freestyle aerial skiing  at Turin in Italy. He made two almost perfect jumps for the highest score. Han had never won a world gold medal before, let alone  in the Olympics! "I never thought this would happen," said the 23-year-old. "I feel like I'm in a dream." It's China's second gold medal at the Turin Olympics. But more important, Han's gold was the country's first ever in a snow sport. In 2002, China's Yang Yang won the gold for speed skating at the winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, US. That Han's win was unexpected doesn't mean that he didn't work hard. Han grew up in Jiangsu Province. Before he started his training on snow, he used to be an acrobat  at a circus. In 1995, a coach found his talent . The coach, Yang Er'qi, said Han had the agility  and courage to be a ski jumper. When Yang first took the 12-year-old to northern China, the boy couldn't swim, skate or ski. But he wasn't afraid of the high platform  and kept on training. Han almost left the sport after hurting his knee months before the Salt Lake Games. In that Olympics he only got 24th. "I was hopeless at that time, but my family and the coach stood firmly  behind me, helping me through," he recalled.  Han Xiaopeng worked so hard that he won the gold medal in the Olympics at last. Because of his success, more and more people in China are becoming interested in skiing. We are proud of him and we hope he will have another big success in the next winter Olympics. Where did Han Xiaopeng take China's first gold on snow?
----------
  A: In China
  B: In Italy.
  C: In America.
  D: In Australia.

Question 227/400:
"Oh,you must have been a spoiled   kid.You must be really bossy.I wonder what you're going to be like to deal with?" That's often the response Angela Hult gets when people find out she's an only child,she told ABC News.Despite such negative   remarks,Hult has decided to have only one child herself.And she's not alone. According to the US' Office for National Statistics,women approaching the end of their childbearing years had an average of 1.9 children in 2004,compared with 3.1 for their counterparts in 1976.The percentage of onechild families in Britain had risen from 18 percent in 1972 to 26 percent in 2007. But even though only children are becoming increasingly common,the traditional view that they're selfish,spoiled and lack social skills holds strong.Even parents of only children,like Hult,are made to feel guilty about having only one child.Worried that they're being selfish and endangering their child's future,they flock to online discussion forums seeking advice.Soon,however,they ask themselves:is this social prejudice really reasonable? "There have been hundreds and hundreds of research studies that show that only children are no different from their peers  ," Susan Newman,a social psychologist at Rutgers University in the US,told ABC News. This raises another question:why are only children still viewed with such suspicion? "There is a belief that's been around probably since humans first existed that to have just one child is somehow dangerous,both for you and for the continuation of your race," Toni Falbo,a professor of educational psychology,told the Guardian."In the past a lot of children died.You'd have had to be crazy to only have one." Times,of course,have changed and infant mortality   has largely reduced.So what do only children themselves say? Kayley Kravitz,a blogger for The Huffington Post,grew up as an only child and highly recommends the experience."Being an only child taught me the most valuable skill of all:the ability to be alone," she said. What is the common belief since human existed?
----------
  A: The infant death rate always stays high.
  B: People are crazy to have only one child.
  C: It's easy for only children to earn their living.
  D: It's hard to continue the family line with only one child.

Question 228/400:
In the world of fairy tales, great and powerful men are often helped to victory by the small and weak. But in the prefix = st1 /USit has happened for real. Nine - year - old Noah McCullough from Texas, has taken on the role of speaking to the public in support of President George W. Bush's social security reforms. On February 25 he signed an agreement with the American Congress to work for the White House as a volunteer. "What I want to tell people about social security is not to be afraid of the new plan," Noah said. "It may be a change, but it's a good change." Besides this task, he already has a higher goal. He plans to run for the White House in 2032.  So far, Noah seems to have a very bright future. Despite his age, Noah already has his firm opinion on running the US. "I firmly believe that the combination of large business and small governments creates a peaceful and present society because industry can stimulate   economic growth," he said. Noah's politics do not come from his parents. "He is very patriotic  and very republican," said Noah's mother, Donna McCullough. "It's the way he was born." Noah's interest began after a mock  election in the kindergarten when he was five years old. Now he has read more than 3,000 books on presidential history. He can recite the names of all 43 American presidents. He can also describe the achievements and events that took place during a president's term of office. His unusual experiences in the presidential campaign last year made him a famous figure. He was a member of Bush's presidential campaign team. He gave speeches at the Republican convention   and followed Bush around on his tour of 27 states. President Bush thinks highly of the boy, saying that he is "the miracle kid of the White House". Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?

Question 230/400:
High-tech gadget shows draw throngs of excited consumers each year in the United States, Japan, Europe and the Arabian peninsula. Though many people are already surrounded with all kinds of smart electronic devices, some always need one more -- better and smarter than the previous one. At electronic shows, visitors flock around the newest tablet computers, cameras, 3D television screens, even small robots, dreaming of taking one home. Consumers spend hours waiting in lines and spend hundreds of dollars to be among the first to get the latest smart phone. The modern world seems to _ shiny expensive objects that keep us connected, help us navigate, record our thoughts and memorable events, and even talk to us. So infatuated, we no longer merely "own" our gadgets -- we have relationships with them, according to clinical psychologist and life transition therapist Francine Lederer. "It's a lot easier to have, right, a one-sided relationship with your computer, your phone, than it is with a live person. So that at the end of the day, you don't need to worry about somebody being angry with you, you don't need to worry about getting blamed for anything," she said. Magical devices Although having a thousand Facebook friends may be perceived as equivalent to having a thousand real, authentic friendships, Lederer said in reality it is not so. "It comes down to a lot of the internal stuff. How we feel about ourselves, our own sense of self-esteem, our self-worth, a lot of those things," she said. But gadgets are magical. They fascinate us the same way we are intrigued by a magician's trick, said psychology professor at the University of the South Pacific, Robert Epstein. "If you don't know how they're doing it, that's very fascinating and intriguing. But if they do it 10 times or 20 times or 100 times, it gets boring and you want something else. That's why magicians do not repeat the same trick over and over again," he said. Plugged in, isolated Epstein, former editor-in-chief of Psychology Today magazine, said he is concerned that gadgets will take on a life of their own. "All we're seeing so far is a little bit of the so-called wearable technology that you might wear on your wrist or in your glasses, but we're moving very rapidly, whether the public knows it or not, toward real biological interfaces so that the gadgets will be built into us to some extent," he said. Lederer said the danger is that our dependence on electronic gadgets is increasingly being perceived as normal. "I think our society in a way, and the media, often times normalizes the extent to which we use these gadgets and phones, but the reality is, it's really not healthy for us," she said.

Question 231/400:
I met my step-mom for the first time when I moved to America to be reunited with my father. From the beginning she made sure to let me know that I was safe and welcome.  I remember when I first saw her at the airport. It was different but not uncomfortable. After I was picked up from the airport we went home and she unpacked my luggage. Then she took me shopping for new clothes since the ones I had brought with me from Africa were a bit worn. That night before I went to bed she came to my room, which was the first room I had ever had for my own, with the first bed I didn't have to share. She told me she was glad to have me and that she would take good care of me. Before she walked out of my new room, she asked me for a hug. I had no idea what she was talking about. I did not know what the word hug meant, not because I didn't speak English, but I had just never heard the word before, let alone knew what it meant. So, I just looked at her with a questioning expression on my face. But she didn't give up. She called my father into the room and asked him to explain to me what she meant. When my father was explaining I looked at her and wondered why she wanted to hug me. She then told me it was because she loved me and opened her arms wide. Shyly I opened mine and we hugged. That was my very first hug and I was 11 at that time. I'm 23 now and, thankfully, I have received many hugs since then. I consider her my birth mother because life began when I came to stay with her. For the first time there were no kids for me to take care of and I became a child for the first time. There was no work waiting for me every day other than the occasional chores that she gave me to teach me responsibility.  Today I say thank-you to my mother; thank you for giving me my childhood back after it had been taken away from me. I am who I am today because of your love! What was the author's life in Africa?
----------
  A: Difficult.
  B: Amusing.
  C: Challenging.
  D: Satisfactory.

Question 232/400:
In the United States and several other countries , 2.5 million children play baseball in an organization called Little League . They play on teams in their hometowns . Their parents and other adults in the community coach or instruct them and serve as umpires to make sure that everyone follows the rules . Local businesses give money for the ball fields and the uniforms . Local teams compete against each other and the winners get to play teams that are more distant . Eventually , the top teams go to the Little League World Series . One hundred years after Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown , New York , in 1839 , Little League got started in Pennsylvania . Three men started the game for neighborhood boys with a smaller playing field and fewer innings than adult baseball . Little League became popular after World War II when the game spread across the United States . By 1955 it was played throughout North America and within five years it had spread to Europe . Children's baseball really caught on in Japan and Taiwan of China and teams from those areas won the World Series seven out of eight years . After this , the organization tried banning foreign teams from the World Series , but the ban came to an end after one year . At first , Little League was only for boys aged nine to twelve . However , in 1974 , the parents of girl baseball players brought a law suit . The courts ruled that Little League had to include both boys and girls . Later Little League added on softball and other games for teenagers up to age eighteen . Occasionally , a Little Leaguer becomes a professional player . For example , Gary Carter went from Little League to play nineteen seasons in the Major Leagues , ten of them as an All-Star player . By and large , youngsters play baseball for fun , but their parents are pround of them . What is TRUE about players today ?
----------
  A: Girl have to buy their suits .
  B: Only boys can play in Little League .
  C: Girls and boys can participate up to age 18 .
  D: Foreign players are banned from the World Series .

Question 233/400:
One of the worst feelings you have as a professional athlete is the feeling after losing a game to a team that you should have beaten. That happened last night against the lowly Boston Celtics. They had only won 13 games the whole year and were really struggling. We had just come off a very good win against the Orlando Magic on the road and were feeling good about ourselves. The day did not start out good for us when we learned that T-Mac was going to miss the game with the flu. When you lose your best players (Yao, T-Mac) everyone must play a little harder and do a little bit more on the floor. We inserted Bonzi Wells into the lineup (he was the only one to have a good game for us), in place of T-Mac. It was a nasty game. We are usually one of the best three point shooting teams in the NBA and we only made 1 of 22 three point shots! I have never seen that happen. Never! Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious. In the locker room after the game, everybody felt terrible. When we play a bad game, we feel that we let our teammates down. There is a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach when you leave the gym and you just want to go home and not talk to anyone. It is a terrible feeling, but it is a feeling that makes you want to try harder and do better the next time. I'll talk to you guys later. Shane How do you think the writer might describe his performance that night?

Question 234/400:
On Friday, June 20th, 29 dogs along with their owners came to Santa Rosa, California. They came there to take part in an unusual competition--one that seeks out and honors the World's Ugliest Dog. Now in its 26th year, the competition is one of the biggest attractions at the annual Sonoma County Fair. Among the leading competitors were Cupcake, who was adopted   from a local dog rescue center in January and Shorty, who would have been put to sleep if its owner, Jason, wasn't kind enough to pick it up. Also competing was 11-year-old veteran Grovie. Described by his owner as short and funny, the Chinese pug is a local resident who has taken part in this contest several times. Then there was 2002 "World's Ugliest Dog" and "Ring of Champions" winner, Rascal. The 7lbs naturally hairless dog with very few teeth comes from an impressive background  . His grandfather, Chi Chi, holds the Guinness World Record for winning the title "World's Ugliest Dog" seven times! But all these impressively "ugly" dogs had no chance against Peanut. The two-year-old dog was badly burnt in a fire which caused him to lose his lips, most of his body hair and eyelids. Besides winning the title, $1,500 USD in cash and a large trophy  , the first time winner also enjoyed an all-expenses-paid trip to New York City where he made scheduled appearances on the Today Show and the Jimmy Kimmel Show. The competition is a great way to honor these dogs, many of whom get their unusual looks because of human abuse  . But most importantly, it raises awareness about their adoption by showing the world that ugliness does not prevent dogs from becoming very loving pets. It can be inferred that Jason adopted Shorty probably because he  _  .
----------
  A: thought Shorty would win the competition
  B: loved Shorty's appearance very much
  C: didn't want Shorty to be homeless

Question 235/400:
The US government has started a website, Admongo, to help children think critically about the advertising aimed at them. It claims to provide visitors with an "education" through games and other amusement. A cartoon man dressed in old time pilot clothing greets visitors to Admongo. "Call me Haiz", he says upon arrival in a rocket ship that opens up with a crazy world inside it. Spacey dance music plays in the background as Haiz tells visitors that they need to learn about advertising. Its inventors say eight to twelve years old is the age kids develop their critical thinking abilities. Kids that age are also a big market for advertisers. The idea behind Admongo is to teach children three things: To _ the advertiser. To know what the advertiser is really saying. And to know what the advertisement is trying to get the child to do. Children learn these things through a video game. They create their own game character. They can choose different skin colors, hair styles, eye and mouth shapes. Then they begin a trip through ad-land, where there are ads on buses and billboards. The players have to find all the marketing in the neighborhood before they can move on to the next level. The Admongo game takes players inside a home, to the advertising studio and everywhere else ads can be found. It is a complete exploration of the world of marketing. One such area is food marketing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says it is a big business. The FTC estimates that food, drink and fast-food restaurants spent more than one and a half billion dollars on advertising to young people in 2010. The FTC says children are important for three reasons. They buy products. They influence parents and caregivers to buy. And they are the future adult buyers of the products. A recent study says most advertising aimed at children is for foods of the lowest nutritional value. First Lady Michelle Obama has said she would like to see advertisers marketing healthy foods for children. What is the best title of the text?
----------
  A: The guide of Admongo
  B: An education website for children
  C: A popular online video game

Question 238/400:
It was one of the hottest days of the dry season. It had not rained in almost a month. The crops were dying. Cows had stopped giving milk. If it did not rain soon, we would lose everything. On this day, I witnessed  a wonder. I was making lunch when I saw my 6-year-old son, Billy, walking very slowly toward the woods. Minutes later he came running out again, toward the house. Soon after, I saw him walking toward the woods again. This went on for an hour. Finally I walked out of the house quietly and followed him. Billy cupped both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Leaves slapped his face but he kept walking into the woods. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a tiny baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it lifted its head with great effort to drink the water in my boy's hands. When the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the tap. Billy opened it and a small trickle  came out. He knelt down, letting the drops slowly fill up his "cup". Now I understood what was going on. The week before, he tried giving water to our horses but I told him not to waste water. Now when he stood up and turned, I was there in front of him. His eyes filled with tears, "I'm not wasting," he said. I joined him with a small pot of water from the kitchen. I let him walk to the baby deer alone while I stood at the edge of the woods. As tears rolled down my face, they were suddenly joined by other drops... and more drops... as if the sky itself was crying. What's the best title for the passage?
----------
  A: The wonder of water.
  B: The wasted water
  C: The crying mother and son
  D: The dying deer

Question 240/400:
Jeri Solomon is a morning person but Jim, her husband of 11 years, is not. Early in their life, it caused a problem. "When we were planning our wedding, I wanted to have these big discussions at 8 a. m.,when I had been up for two hours and was fresh, but Jim would just be getting out of bed," says the 46-year-old designer from Melrose, Mass. "We ended up getting into many arguments because I thought he had no interest, when really he was just still half-asleep." The couple learned to work around their differences over the years, but their situation isn't uncommon, says Katherine Sharkey, professor at BrownUniversity. "More women tend to be larks, while men are like night owls ," she says. The question is:Why? The answer lies in each person's body clock. "The body clock is about 24 hours, thanks to Earth's 24-hour light-dark cycle," Sharkey says. "But some people have a longer natural cycle, and some are shorter." If yours is on the long side, you're more likely to be a night owl. If it runs short, you're probably an early riser. But your body clock can change over your lifetime. There's a developmental piece-school-age children are generally early birds, while teenagers tend to be night owls, and then as they age, adults gradually turn back into morning people," Sharkey says. Besides the clear problems with being a night owl if you have fl day job, "night owls tend to be more low-spirited, and have a higher dependence on coffee," Sharkey says. But the news isn't all bad. A recent study in Belgium found that night owls can stay more focused as the day goes on, compared with early risers. Morning people, however, also have advantages. "Larks generally sleep better, have more regular sleep, and have more flexible characters," Sharkey says. They also tend to be happier and feel healthier than night owls, according to a recent study from the University of Toronto. Compared with morning people, night owls   _  .

Question 242/400:
Etymology, the study of words and word roots, may sound like the kind of thing done by boring librarians in small, dusty rooms.Yet etymologists actually have a uniquely interesting job.They are in many ways just like archaeologists   digging up the physical history of people and events.The special aspect of etymology is that it digs up history, so to speak, through the words and phrases that are left behind. The English language, in particular, is a great field to explore history through words. As a language, English has an extraordinary number of words.This is partly due to its ability to adapt foreign words so readily.For example, "English" words such as kindergarten (from German), croissant (from French), and cheetah (from Hindi) have become part of the language with little or no change from their original sounds and spellings. So English-language etymologists have a vast world of words to explore. Another enjoyable thing about etymology for most word experts is solving word mysteries .No, etymologists do not go around solving murders, like the great detective Sherlock Holmes.What these word experts solve are mysterious origins of some of our most common words One of the biggest questions English language experts have _ is how English came to have the phrase OK.Though it is one of the most commonly used expressions, its exact beginning is a puzzle even to this day.Even its spelling is not entirely consistent-unless you spell it Okay, it is hard even to call it a word. Etymologists have been able to narrow OK's origin down to a likely, although not certain, source .It became widely used around the time of Martin Van Buren's run for president in 1840. His nickname was Old Kinderhook. What troubles word experts about this explanation is that the phrase appeared in some newspapers before Van Buren became well known.It is likely that Van Buren could be called its primary source Etymologists will doubtlessly keep searching for the initial source.However, it is clear that OK's popularity and reputation have topped those of the American president to whom it has been most clearly linked. What is the main purpose of the passage?
----------

Question 243/400:
Iggy Azalea doesn't look like a rapper . On May 17, she attended the 2015 Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas, US, with pink hair and a blue coat. She looked like a model, but won big as a rapper. The 24-year-old Australian beat out big names like Nicki Minaj and Drake to win the award for Top Rap Artist.   It's a great achievement in many people's eyes, but Azalea knew what she wanted from the beginning. At 15 she dropped out of high school because she was only interested in art class. She worked as a house cleaner to save money for her dream the following year. Before her 16th birthday, Azalea left her home, a tiny town in Australia, for the US, making up her mind to become a rapper. Moving from Miami to Houston to Atlanta, she started rapping in the Southern-style accent of her surroundings and her single "Ignorant Art" came out in 2011. From then on, she has never looked back. However, her style has caused lots of discussions. She might be one of the most polarizing artists. She raps with a southern American accent, even though she speaks with an Australian one. Many people comment that she overuses black culture in her music. Her supporters are against it. Female American rapper MC Lyte defended Azalea in an interview, saying she should not be judged because of where she's from. "Hip hop is universal, no color1 lines." MC Lyte said. Azalea herself is proud of her music. "I really want to be focused on what I'm doing," she said in an interview."That's really dangerous when you're trying to figure out ways to entertain people and make them happy. I don't want to be a part of that." By saying "I don't want to be a part of that." Azalea means that   _  .
----------
  A: she's unwilling to become popular
  B: her music is not for entertainment
  C: she refuses to learn from other rappers
  D: her music is not affected by others' taste

Question 244/400:
Herta Muller, the Romanian-born German writer, has won the 2009 Nobel Prize for Literature.The award was announced in Stockholm on Thursday.          Ms.Muller, 56, immigrated to Germany from Romania in 1987.She is the first German writer to win the Nobel in literature since Gunter Grass in 1999 and the 13th winner writing in German since the prize was first given in 1901.She is the 12th woman to win the literature prize.But unlike previous winners like Doris Lessing and V.S.Naipaul, Ms.Muller is  ly unknown outside of literary circles in Germany.          "I am very surprised and still cannot believe it," Ms.Muller said in a statement delivered by her publisher in Germany."I can't say anything more at the moment."          She has written some 20 books, but just 5 have been translated into English, including the novels "The Land of Green Plums" and "The Appointment."          At the news conference on Thursday at the German Publishers & Booksellers Association in Berlin, where she lives, Ms.Muller, wearing all black and sitting on a leopard-print chair, appeared nervous with all the cameras flashing on her.          When asked what it meant that her name would now be mentioned in the same breath as German greats like Thomas Mann and Heinrich Boll, Ms.Muller remained philosophical."I am now nothing better and I'm nothing worse," she said, adding: "My inner thing is writing.That's what I can hold on to."          Earlier in the day, at a news conference in Stockholm, Peter England, secretary of the Swedish Academy, said Ms.Muller was honored for her "very, very distinct special language" and because "she has really a story to tell about cruelty and repression in a village much like the one Muller grew up in."          The awards ceremony is planned for Dec.10 in Stockholm.As the winner, Ms.Muller will receive about $1.4 million. By saying "I am now nothing better and I'm nothing worse", Ms.Muller meant that   _  .
----------
  A: she thought highly of herself
  B: she thought nothing of herself
  C: she was very modest
  D: she was no worse than the other German writers

Question 246/400:
We were standing at the top of a church not far from my home. I didn't know why. "Look down," Father said. I tried and saw the square in the center of the village. And I saw the streets to the square. "See, Elsa," Father said. "There is more than one way to the square. If you can't get where you want to go by one road, try another." Earlier that day, I asked Mother to do something about what we had for lunch at school. But she didn't think the food was as bad as I said. When I turned to Father for help, he brought me to the church. At school the next day, I filled a bottle with the soup for our lunch and took it home. I told the cook to pour the soup in a plate and bring it to Mother. She drank it and cried out, "What's the matter with the soup today?" I at once told her what I had done , and Mother said that she would take up the matter of lunches at school the next day . Now I really understood why Father had taken me to the church. I began to work as a fashion designer two years ago. I wouldn't stop working until I tried every way to my goal. What Elsa's father said means?
----------
  A: one can reach the square in many ways
  B: never stop trying to get to your goal

Question 250/400:
A man enters a store to buy milk. He walks out of the store with milk. That is all-- milk. At the same time, a woman enters the same grocery store also to buy milk. She buys it. But, she also buys chicken and lemons to make dinner that night. Then she remembers to buy food for her son to eat at school. She also gets a bottle of wine for drinks with friends and a birthday card for her husband's niece. Then she gets coffee for breakfast, ice cream for dessert and remembers stamps to mail the bills. And don't forget soap for the bathroom. And that is the difference between the female and male brains simply explained in a grocery store. Generally speaking,men do one thing at a time. Women do many. Doing many things at one time is often called "multi-tasking", a very popular word these days. Now scientific research supports this theory about male and female brains. A recent study has confirmed what we have known all along--men and women think differently. Scientist at the university of Pennsylvania studied brain images of 949 people aged from 8 to 22 years old. They found that male brains have more connections on one side of the brain, or hemisphere. In female brain, they found more activity and connections between the right and left sides of the brain. The left side of the brain is known as the side of "reason" The right hemisphere is known as the "creative" side. Regina Verma is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She co-wrote the report. She says when women are asked to do something difficult they might use different parts of the brain. Men, she adds, generally use just one side of the brain. As a result, men generally deal directly with a problem. There is a strong connection between the "understanding" and the "action" parts of their brains. Women, however, might include other parts of the brain, like the part connected with reason and the part connected with sensitivity when solving a problem. Women take a less direct path to find a solution. Dr. Venma warns that the study should not lead anyone to expect some behaviors from women and others from men. What would be the best title for the passage?
----------
  A: "reason" brain or "creative" brain
  B: Multi-tasking or single-tasking
  C: Costly shopping or economical shopping
  D: Reason or sensitivity

Question 251/400:
The general objective of public interest advertising is to inform, persuade, or remind people about the particular idea, cause, or philosophy being advertised. This kind of advertising is often used by non-business institutions, such as schools, hospitals and charity organizations. We also see advertising by associations. In addition, we witness millions of dollars' worth of advertising placed by government organizations. Much government advertising announces the availability of such valuable government services as consumer assistance, welfare aid, or career guidance. However, with the resource available to it, the government can also use advertising techniques for propaganda purposes. Many state governments use advertising to attract new businesses, tourists, or workers to aid their economy. Because of the fact that public interest advertising is nonprofit, the words it uses are much more different from the other 3 kinds of advertising. Its purpose is not to urge readers to spend their money, but to disseminate a kind of concept or advocate a social ethic. The headline of public interest advertising also acts as a role of attraction. The average words of them are 10.6, and most of them are curious headlines (60%) and emotional headlines (30%). We can know from the statistics that attracting the reader is still a main task for the headline of public interest advertising, because only when the readers feel the advertising will benefit them (no matter physically or mentally) should they have the patience to read it further--that's the rule of all the advertisements. I also notice that only 10% of those advertisements include their advertiser's brand, which shows that the public interest advertisements do not aim to propagandize any company or organization. Straight-line body copy is the most frequently used form--which is 50% of the 20 ads. 75% of those ads have used imperative sentences. Most of these sentences are urging readers to take action immediately for others or social ethics. All these data show the fact that public interest advertising does not please readers by beautiful words or original ideas, but touch them through true feelings. What can we learn from the passage?
----------
  A: Public interest advertising encourages people to buy goods.
  B: Public interest advertising sometimes forces concepts upon the public.
  C: We cannot see any advertiser's brand in public interest advertisements.
  D: The words of public interest advertisements are mostly emotional.

Question 254/400:
Although I didn't have any interest in being a school bus driver, I became one. Many years later, I was still working on the school bus. There are so many good reasons. Firstly, the talk brought me different kinds of information. I also got to hear all the family secrets of the newcomers. I have a toy bear who was a great comforter  for the little ones. The kids got to look after him on the trip to school and he waited patiently for _ to get on for the trip home. Our bus would often pass a place where we could see some alpacas   in front of a farm house. Little Michael would cry excitedly from the seat, "Look, Miss! Look at the camels!" He used to put his head out of the bus window. When I warned him that a little insect would come into his nose if he wasn't careful, he smartly gave up the habit. I remember a little girl got on the bus one morning 5 years ago and sobbed  all the way to school. We arrived at the school gate. As she waited to get down the bus, she threw her arms around my neck and cried that her grandfather had died the night before. A school bus driver needs to keep one eye on the road and the other on the mirror to watch what the little ones are doing down the back. Now, it's important to think how many lives I've been responsible  for, and how many kilometers I've driven in order to get my passengers home safely during the 20 years. I've enjoyed it, but it's time to rest and park my school bus. Which of the following is TRUE?
----------
  A: Children didn't like the driver.
  B: The driver likes the job all the time.
  C: The little girl was excited at seeing the camels.
  D: Children sometimes talked about their family secrets on the bus.

When we worry about who might be spying on our private lives, we usually think about the Federal agents. But the private sector outdoes the government every time. It's Linda Tripp, not the FBI, who is facing charges under Maryland's laws against secret telephone taping. It's our banks, not the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that pass our private financial data to telemarketing firms. Consumer activists are pressing Congress for better privacy laws without much result so far. The legislators lean toward letting business people track our financial habits virtually at will. As an example of what's going on, consider U.S. Bancorp, which was recently sued for deceptive practices by the state of Minnesota. According to the lawsuit, the bank supplied a telemarketer called Member Works with sensitive customer data such as names, phone numbers, bank-account and credit-card numbers, social security numbers, account balances and credit limits. With these customer lists in hand, Member Works started dialing for dollars-selling dental plans, videogames, computer software and other products and services. Customers who accepted a "free trial offer" had 30 days to cancel. If the deadline passed, they were charged automatically through their bank or credit-card accounts. U.S. Bancorp collected a share of the revenues. Customers were doubly deceived, the lawsuit claims. They didn't know that the bank was giving account numbers to Member Works. And if customers asked, they were led to think the answer was no. The state sued Member Works separately for deceptive selling. The company denies that it did anything wrong. For its part, U.S. Bancorp settled without admitting any mistakes. But it agreed to stop exposing its customers to nonfinancial products sold by outside firms. A few top banks decided to do the same. Many other banks will still do business with Member Works and similar firms. And banks will still be mining data from your account in order to sell you financial products, including things of little value, such as credit insurance and credit-card protection plans. You have almost no protection from businesses that use your personal accounts for profit. For example, no federal law shields "transaction and experience" information-mainly the details of your bank and credit-card accounts. Social Security numbers are for sale by private firms. They've generally agreed not to sell to the public. But to businesses, the numbers are an open book. Self-regulation doesn't work. A firm might publish a privacy-protection policy, but who enforces it? Take U.S. Bancorp again. Customers were told, in writing, that "all personal information you supply to us will be considered confidential." Then it sold your data to Member Works. The bank even claims that it doesn't "sell" your data at all. It merely "shares" it and reaps a profit. Now you know. When the "free trial" deadline is over, you'll be charged without notice for a product or service if   _  .
----------
  A: you happen to reveal your credit card number
  B: you fail to cancel it within the specified period

Question 257/400:
On the way back from work every evening, more often than not there would be a homeless man standing at the exit of the freeway  . He looked to be in his late 40s but was probably a lot younger. He had shoulder length straight black hair and a short beard. Every day after work I would remember to gather any spare change, and put it aside to give to him if I saw him. A feeling of joy would come over me every time I saw him, while coming off the ramp  . So did he. Sometimes the red light would be on for a minute and we would ask each other about our day. His answer would always be the same, "I'm blessed!" Then one day I was called into my boss's office and was told that I was being laid off. For the rest of that day all I could think of was "how am I going to provide for my kids as a mother, how am I going to pay rent?" Needless to say that on my way home that day I was very sad and upset. I didn't remember to look for my spare change and keep it ready like I usually did. Yet there he was as always, as I turned the ramp. He set his eyes on me, while still smiling and waving at others as usual. While I was waiting for the red light to turn, he strolled   over to my car. He had a big smile. He looked at me straight in the eyes and said, "Today I will give you a dollar." He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a dollar bill. You see that day he taught me a valuable lesson more than a dollar bill. No matter what material things are taken from you, no one can take away your choice to be joyful. Every time I'm faced with challenges, I think of the homeless man's valuable lesson and remember that I am blessed. The writer learned from the story that  _  .
----------
  A: a dollar bill will be enough to make you happy
  B: each of us has been blessed all the time
  C: whenever it is, we should choose to help others
  D: it is more than money that brings us happiness

Question 258/400:
Betty and I are best friends. Our birthdays are on the same day, so every year we have a birthday party together. But this year we had a costume party instead. While we were writing the invitations, my mom came in and asked, "Nancy, what about inviting John?" John had been in our class for only a few months, but he was already getting better grades in math than anyone else in our class. "Mom, he wears the same pants to school every day. How could he even afford a costume?" Mom said nothing. The next day, mom gave me an envelope  with a shopping card in it. "I thought it would be nice for you to give this to John." Mom said. But how? We didn't want to make John embarrassed. We discussed it for a long time. Finally, Betty and I had a good idea. On the day of our party, John arrived, in an old sheet ,but still in the same brown pants as usual. Before eating the birthday cake, Betty said in a loud voice, "Now it's time for the great prize game." It was a math game. None of us were surprised when John gave the right answer first and walked off with the envelope. Everything went well as we planned. John wore a new pair of pants and a new shirt the next week. He felt happy. So did we. _   had the idea of playing a math game.

Question 259/400:
To find how the name Canada came about we must go back to the 16th century. At that time, the French dreamed of disclosing and controlling more land, of expanding trade beyond   their borders and of spreading their faith  across the world .In 1535, Francois I ,King of France, ordered a navigator   named Jacques Cartier to explore  the New World and search for a passage to India. Cartier first arrived at the Gulf of the St. Lawrence, which he wanted to explore. He did not know what to expect but he hoped that this Gulf was just an arm of the ocean between two islands. If it was, he would soon be on his way to the Far East. So he sailed upstream along the St. Lawrence River. However, instead or reaching Asia he arrived at Quebec or Stadacona, as the Indians called it. It was at this point that the term " Canada" entered the country's history. Apparently the word "Canada" came from an Indian work "Kanata", which means community or village. Cartier first used it when he referred to Stadacona or Quebec. What a huge " village" Canada is! Having reached the Gulf of St. Lawrence Cartier thought   _

Question 260/400:
In a world as fast-changing and full of information as our own, all of us need to know how to learn well. Yet evidence suggests that most of us don't use the learning techniques that science has proved the most effective. The scientific literature evaluating these techniques goes back to decades and across thousands of articles. It's far too _ and complex for the average parent, teacher or employer to look through. Fortunately, a team of five leading psychologists have done the job for us. Professor John Dunlosky and other psychologists closely examined 10 learning strategies and rated each from high to low utility  on the basis of the evidence they've gathered. Here's part of their conclusions: In contrast to familiar practices, the effective learning strategies with the most evidence to support them aren't well known outside the lab. Take distributed practice, for example. This strategy involves spreading out your study time, rather than engaging in one marathon. Cramming  information at the last minute may allow you to get through that test or meeting, but the material will quickly disappear from your memory. It's much more effective to look through the material at intervals over time. And the longer you want to remember the information, whether it's two weeks or two years, the longer the intervals should be. The second learning strategy that is highly recommended by Dunlosky is practice testing. Yes, more tests---but there not for a grade. Research shows that the mere act of calling information to mind strengthens that knowledge and aids in future retrieval  . While practice testing is not a common strategy---despite the strong evidence supporting it ---there is one familiar approach that captures its benefits: using flash cards. And now flash cards can be presented in digital form. Both distributed practice and practice testing were rated as having "high utility" by Dunlosky. The evidence shows that the strategy of practice testing   _  .
----------
  A: is a way to use flash cards to help study
  B: is mainly used to help us remember well
  C: helps know about students' grades in time

Question 261/400:
Tea bag drinking is most westerners' favorite way of drinking tea. Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose   tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze   and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. _ , and today 85% of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea. This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy, tasty way to go. From the passage we can learn that Thomas Sullivan was very   _  .

Question 262/400:
Personal computers and the Internet give people new choices about how to spend their time. Some may use this freedom to share less time with certain friends or family members, but new technology will also let them stay in closer touch with those they care most about. I know this from personal experience. E-mail makes it easy to work at home, which is where I now spend most weekends and evenings. My working hours aren't necessarily much shorter than they once were but I spend fewer of them at the office. This lets me share more time with my young daughter than I might have if she'd been born before electronic mail became such a practical tool. The Internet also makes it easy to share thoughts with a group of friends. Say you do something fun see a great movie perhaps-and there are four or five friends who might want to hear about it. If you call each one, you may tire of telling the story. With E-mail, you just write one note about your experience, at your convenience, and address it to all the friends you think might be interested. They can read your message when they have time, and read only as much as they want to. They can reply at their convenience, and you can read what they have to say at your convenience. E-mail is also an inexpensive way stay in close touch with people who live far away. More than a few parents use E-mail to keep in touch, even daily touch, with their children off at college. We just have to keep in mind that computers and the Internet offer another way of staying in touch. They don't take the place of any of the old ways. The use of E-mail has made it possible for the writer to   _  .

Question 263/400:
In ancient times, there was a painter. He was good at painting flowers and birds. But he never stopped practicing until he became very famous. An emperor of China also loved paintings,especially roosters . So he asked the famous painter to paint a rooster for him. He wanted the rooster to be the best among all his collections. The painter promised to do so. The emperor waited and waited for one year.,but he didn't get the picture. He couldn't waited to see the painter. He became angry and wanted to kill him. So the painter hurried into the palace with paper,paint and a brush. In five minutes, a perfect rooster was on the paper. After seeing this,the emperor became much angrier. "Since you can paint a rooster in five minutes, why did you keep me waiting for over a year?"he asked. "Your Majesty ,"said the artist. "I will let you know why.But you'll have to come with me. " he invited the emperor to his house. There, there were piles and piles of paper. On every piece of paper was a painting of a rooster. "Your Majesty ,"said the painter. "It took me more than one year to improve my painting skill in order to paint a perfect rooster for you. According to the writer, the emperor  _  .

Question 264/400:
In less than 60 years the people of my tribe have gone from being an independent nation, to cultural prisoners, to welfare recipients   . Is it any wonder that there are so many problems facing indigenous   Australians today? When I was growing up in Kowanyama there were 15 people in my class, I am the only one who has gone to university. I'm also the only girl in my class who did not have a child at 15. Of the boys in my class, seven have been incarcerated, two for murder, five for robbery and rape. Only three of us are not alcoholics. Four of my classmates have committed suicide. Life as a young aborigine is not easy, in any setting. The story of my fellow students is a lesson in the magnitude of the problems that young indigenous people in Cape York face. The two issues that are central to changing this story are education and health. There is a huge gap between what we get in communities and what other kids get in cities. One of the problems facing education in remote indigenous schools is that teachers tend to be just out of training and stay for only a year or two. Not one teacher stayed for the whole of my nine years at school--not even the principals. This seeming lack of commitment makes you feel they don't care. We need to review the curriculum in these communities because it is pitched at a very low level. I have had to draw the conclusion that governments and educationalists see us as less than white people. Education should be uplifting, not serve to reinforce lack of self-esteem and the heart-wrenching low expectations that our race suffer from. We need a massive reassessment of,education policies and an equally massive investment in education. We have spent so long listening to some white fellows telling us we are stupid, lazy no-hopers that the majority of my people actually believe it. The relationship between poor education and poor health is clear. People whose self-esteem and pride have been destroyed by a substandard education system and a social system that creates an addiction to passive welfare have little reason to live healthy lives. Our health is getting worse. The policies that determine the delivery of health services are deeply flawed by a bureaucracy   that does not want to hear our voices. Health services are often confined to the clinic. It is problems and challenges such as these that led me to stand in last October's ATSIC election. ATSITC is more than the board of commissioners and the Canberra bureaucracy. ATSIC is also people who are from community and work hard for community. We recognize that governments cannot solve our problems for us. As young people we are trying to take responsibility for our future. I ask the Prime Minister, not that he fixes these problems for us but that he and his Government see us as equal partners in the huge task of rebuilding our families, communities and Cape York Peninsula. He demonstrated his commitment by engaging his Government at the family and domestic violence summit. My view is that the level of domestic violence and child abuse sums up all that has been wrong with Aboriginal policy. .We need a new relationship to address this frightening reality in our lives. Aboriginal people are reluctant to admit that young girls and women are being raped by their own people because of the blanket of shame.              * I am asking you to help lift that blanket. I stand here as a proud Aboriginal woman, a Kokoberra woman as well as a criminologist, and I thank you for your time and attention. Tania Major, 22, is an ATSIC regional councilor and a trainee manager at her home community of Kowanyama on Cape York. This is an edited version of an address she is scheduled to give at a meeting between the Prime Minister and Cape York leaders (full text at smh. com. an). Who. do you think are Tania's audience?
----------
  A: Aboriginal people.
  B: Young boys and girls in Kowanyama.

Question 265/400:
A weather map is an important tool for geographers.   A succession of three or four maps presents continuous picture of weather changes. Weather forecasters are able to determine the speed of air masses and fronts   to determine whether an individual pressure aroa is deepening or becoming shallow and whether a front is increasing or decreasing in intensity  .They are also able to determine whether an air mass is retaining its original characteristics or taking on those of the surface over which it is moving. Thus, a most significant function of the map is to reveal a summary picture of conditions in the atmosphere at a given time. All students of geography should be able to interpret a weather map accurately.Weather maps contain an enormous amount of information about weather conditions existing at the time of observation over a large geographical area. They reveal in a few minutes what otherwise would take hours to describe. The United States  Weather Bureau issues information about approaching storms, floods, frosts and all climatic conditions in general. Twice a month it issues a 30-day"outlook" which is a rough guide to weather conditions likely to occur over broad areas of the United States. These 30-day outlooks are based upon an anaiysis of the upper air levels which often set the stage for development of air masses, fronts and storms. Considerable effort is being exerted today to achieve more accurate weather predictions, with identifying and tracking storms over regions which have but few meteorological  stations. Extensive experiments are also in progress for weathef modification studies. The thirty-day forecast is determined by examining  _  .

Question 266/400:
After 21 years of marriage, my wife wanted me to take another woman out to dinner and a movie. The other woman my wife wanted me to visit was my mother, who has been a widow  for 19 years, but the demands of my work and my three children had made it impossible to visit her often. That Friday after work, when I arrived at her house, my mother waited in the door with her coat on. She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary.  We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant, was very nice and comfortable. My mother took my arm as if she were the First Lady. During the dinner, we had an agreeable conversation, nothing extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said, "I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you." I agreed. A few days later, my mother died of a massive heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her. Some time later, I received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant receipt from the same place Mother and I had dined. An attached note said "I paid this bill in advance. I wasn't sure that I could be there; but, nevertheless, I paid for two plates--one for you and the other for your wife. You w ill never know what that night meant for me. I love you, son." At that moment, I understood the importance of saying in time 'I love YOU' and to give our loved ones the time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more important than your family. Give them the time they deserve because these things cannot be put off till some "other" time. The author of the passage tends to agree that   _  .
----------
  A: family should be as important as work
  B: work is more important than family
  C: we can show our love till some other time
  D: we should spend more time with our family

Question 267/400:
Today there are 7 billion people on the earth.By the year 2050 there may be 9.0 billion.We will have a lot more people to feed.We need more food. One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic  material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural. They may feed people,then hurt them or their children later.But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use,and they are not going to die.In 2050 we may think differently about them. People plant the GM plants because  _

Question 268/400:
There are many ways of defining success. It is accurate to say that each of us has our own ideas of success to the extent that each of us is responsible for setting our own goals and determining whether we have met these goals satisfactorily. Because each of us possesses unique differences in genetic ability and favorable environments in which to express these abilities, it is necessarily true that we must define success broadly. For some people,simply being able to live their life with the least misery and sufferings is considered a success. Think of the peace of mind of the poor shepherd who tends his sheep, enjoys his simple life with his family in the beauty of nature, and who is respected because he does a good job of achieving the goals expected of him and accepted by his family and his society. On the other hand, it seems that even though some people appear to be rich in material possessions, many of them seem to be miserable and consider themselves unsuccessful when judged by their own standards of success. Because not all ventures can be successful, one should not set unrealistic goals for achieving success, but if one has self-confidence it would be unfortunate to set one's goals at too low a level of achievement. A wise man once said to a young man who was experiencing frustration with his own professional success, "You do not have to set your goal to reach the moon in order to have success in traveling. Sometimes one can be very successful merely by taking a walk in the park or riding the subway downtown," The man added, "You have not really failed and spoiled your chances for success until you have been unsuccessful at something you really like,and to which you have given your best effort. " The purpose of the passage is  _  .
----------
  A: to give us a clear definition of what success is
  B: to talk about how to achieve success
  C: to state what our life goal is
  D: to discuss the importance of goals

Question 269/400:
I was reading these interesting stories behind a group of great logos   in the world. Personally Nike is my favorite one--it's so simple. And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for $ 35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped  signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's " rainbow apple", a rainbow- colored silhouette    of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926. Adidas The Adidas logo, which was created by the founder of the company Adi Dassler, represents mountains, pointing towards the challenges that are seen ahead and goals that can be achieved. The logo was used for the first time in 1976. What does Nike's logo stand for?
----------
  A: The goddess of victory
  B: The source of inspiration for soldiers
  C: The statue of the Greek goddess
  D: The wing of the Greek goddess.

Question 270/400:
Imagine a stranger walking past you on a cold, rainy day. "Lovely weather, isn't it?" the stranger says. Do you laugh, or even smile? If not, you may not have a dry sense of humor. British people, and particularly the English, are well-known for our dry sense of humor. We often say the opposite of what we mean in order to be funny, and tell jokes in a tone of voice that makes it sound like we are being completely serious. As US writer Julian Tan put it on the HuffPost Students blog: "It is as if it is 'Opposite Day' every day in Britain." If the people of Britain are known for having a " _ " and not showing emotion, then our dry sense of humor shows this through jokes. Often it will take a long time or several beers, to get a British person to tell you what they actually think about something and get behind the wall of humorous sarcasm   that they have in front of them. English comedian Ricky Gervais put it like this: "We play jokes on our friends. We use sarcasm as a shield   and a weapon. We avoid being serious until it's absolutely necessary." It can be annoying and confusing if you haven't been raised with these types of jokes: "Why did he just say such a ridiculous thing? Is he making fun of me?" But it is also true that understanding this type of humor is a good way to make friends with people in the UK, even if you don't find it funny. It's important to remember that the person telling the joke may actually be making fun of himself or herself, not you. One of the characteristics of British humor is "its strong theme of self-deprecation" (making fun of oneself), according to Tan. So don't worry - often, English people, and British people in general, just want to make fun of themselves! Which of the following words best describes British humor according to Julian Tan?
----------
  A: Opposite.
  B: Annoying.
  C: Ridiculous.
  D: Funny.

Question 271/400:
TAIBEI - Increasing numbers of Taiwanese students are joining the island's "China rush", seeking education on the Chinese mainland. According to official Chinese figures, the number of Taiwanese students admitted into college and postgraduate programs on the mainland totaled 461 in 1996, 928 in 1997 and 839 in 1998.Although no latest official numbers were available," Netbig.com Said this number had risen between 30 to 50 percent annually in the past two years with well over 1000 entering mainland campuses last year. The Internet site, based in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, provides education service and information on Chinese mainland colleges and universities. "Many Taiwanese believe a Chinese education giving more knowledge about the people and culture in the mainland will increase their chances in the Chinese job market, Net.com vice-president Ingrid Huang said."I believe _ will give me hands-on experience in the business field in the Chinese mainland and a better understanding of the Chinese mainland people," said Lydia Chang, a 19-year-old majoring in journalism at Shih Shin University. Chang plans to go on to get a master's degree in business administration in Shanghai, which she says offers the best environment for such studies. A journalism graduate student, surnamed Lin, at the National Taiwan University said he would like to study law on the Chinese mainland since "there will be better career prospects now that more Taiwanese companies are going there". "They hope the children could build up connections which could later become useful in their business operations," said Yang Ching-yao, professor of the Chinese mainland studies. A Netbig.com survey showed the campuses favored by Taiwan students included Beijing, Qinghua and Renmin universities in Beijing, and Jinan and Zhongshan universities in Guangzhou. The most popular studies were law, business and Chinese medicine. At present, Chinese Taibei doesn't recognize diplomas earned in the Chinese mainland nor help with any inquiries about studying there. But recognizing the trend, education authorities are giving a final form to a policy accepting certificates from selected universities. Some business executives were sending their children to study in the Chinese mainland so that their children   _  .

Question 273/400:
When Kathryn was 6 years old, she sat outside for three hours at her home and did not make a sound.Her parents wondered why she was so quiet, only to discover that she was drawing a picture of a flag outside. She recalled. "That's what I wanted to do that day," said Kathryn, who is now 23 years old. And in the future, she continued to do art as a hobby. Recently, Kathryn was named Lake Placid's first artist in the neighborhood. She will be there for at least four weeks and possibly more. During that time, she will teach an art class and focus on her own art. Much of her work includes creating photos. She said: "There is always something there that you haven't included, so you can never stop when painting a photo." Kathryn ended up as the first artist just by chance. She said her sister was on vacation in Florida and looking for a job in Lake Placid. The sister got the job and moved there. Kathryn said she visited her sister and was ordered to do wall paintings inside a building. Later, her sister saw a demand for an artist on line and suggested she should apply. Kathryn said she's the first artist in her family, but added that her parents are creative. Her father loves to create things from wood, she said. "Anything you can make out of wood, he has made it," she said. Her own creativity with art continued through college. While at college, she was once employed to recreate a photo of a couple on a vacation to Florida and one of a sunset in either North Carolina or South Carolina. Kathryn said she's looking at other forms of art. The time she spends here will help her to "figure out who I am as an artist," she said. What is the passage mainly about?
----------
  A: A young artist treats art more than a hobby.
  B: A hobby becomes a pursuit  for an artist.
  C: A girl finds her value in her own hobby.
  D: A girl walks out of her hobby as an artist.

Question 275/400:
Recently, a professor of philosophy   in the United States has written a book called Money and the Meaning of Life. He has discovered that how we deal with money in our daytoday life has more meaning than we usually think. One of the exercises he asked his students to do is to keep record of every penny they spend for a week. From the way they spend their money,they can see what they really value in life. He says our relation with others often becomes clearly defined when money enters the picture. You might have wonderful friendship with somebody and you think that you are very good friends. But you will know him only when you ask him to lend you some money. If he does,it brings something to the relationship that seems stronger than ever before. Or it can suddenly weaken the relationship if he doesn't. This person may say that he has a certain feeling,but if it is not carried out in the money world,there is something less real about it. Since money is so important to us,we consider those who possess a lot of it to be very important. The author interviewed some millionaires   in researching his book. Question:What is the most surprising thing you have discovered about being rich,because you are a selfmade man? Answer:The most surprising thing is how people give me so much respect. I am nothing. I do not know much. All I am is rich. People just have an idea of making more and more money,but what is it for?How much do I need for any given purposes in my life?In his book,the professor uncovered an important need in modern society:To bring back the idea that money is a tool rather than the purpose. Money plays an important role in the material world,but expecting money to bring happiness may be missing the meaning of life. Which of the following might the author disagree with?
----------
  A: Money is important in modern society.
  B: The meaning of life does not completely lie in money.
  C: Wealth will surely bring the owner happiness.
  D: Happiness is not necessarily the result of wealth.

Question 276/400:
Manners nowadays in metropolitan cities like London are practically non-existence, it's nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an elderly woman aside in the dash for the last remaining seat on the tube or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her. This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy , ) and that those who go out to work should take their turn in the rat race like anyone else. Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it is not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for younger women, the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to ourselves "First come, first severed", while a grey-haired woman, a mother with a young child stands? Yet this is all too often seen. Older people, tired and quick-tempered from a day's work, are not angels, either-far from it. Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the weary queues push and shove each other to get on buses and tubes. One cannot commend this, of course, but on does feel there is just a little more excuse. If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems imperative , not only that communications in transport should be improved, but also that communication between human beings should be kept smooth and polite. All over cities, it seems that people are too tired and too rushed to be polite. Shop assistant's won't bother to assist, taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round corners, bus conductors pull the bell before their desperate passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, and so on and so on. It seems to us that it is up to the young and strong to do their small part to stop such deterioration . The author probably does NOT agree that in big cities   _  .
----------
  A: Life will be even worse if no change is made
  B: transport conditions are rather poor
  C: it's not uncommon to see people quarrel in public places
  D: it's unreasonable to require the tired people to be polite

Question 277/400:
Although Zhang Bichen, a 25-year-old songstress with a powerful yet delicate voice, took the crown of this year's The Voice of China, runner-up Parhat Halik, 32, seems to have impressed more of the audience with his husky , natural and, most of all, distinguished sound. Despite his unmistakable voice, Parhat Halik's music is also special. Generally, it's rock -- but influenced and mixed by different styles within the genre. Read on and find out where Halik's music gets its inspiration. Blues rock Representative artists: Guns N' Roses, The Rolling Stones, John Maye Blues rock combines improvisation   with rock 'n' roll style. It began to develop in the mid-1960s in Britain and the US, when rock bands such as the Rolling Stones experimented with music from older African-American blues musicians. It borrows the idea of instrumental combo from blues but is played at a faster tempo and louder volume, distinguishing it from the blues. The sound is created with the electric guitar, piano, bass and drums. As the root for several contemporary rock styles, such as heavy metal and hard rock, blues rock had a rebirth in the early 2000s, with artists including John Mayer and The Black Keys. Folk rock Representative artists: Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, The Byrds As the name indicates, folk rock is a genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. Also developed in the mid-1960s, folk rock was pioneered by the US band The Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and Bob Dylan-penned material with rock instruments, in a style heavily influenced by The Beatles and other British bands. The genre was most popular among teenagers and college students at the time, because it includes both rock 'n' roll's free spirit and the more serious, culturally authentic and socially aware sounds of folk music. Soft rock Representative artists: Bryan Adams, Eagles, Elton John, James Blunt Compared to hard rock's loud and aggressive nature, soft rock, or light rock, uses the techniques of rock music to compose a softer and less threatening sound. Derived from folk rock, it uses acoustic instruments and puts more emphasis on melody and harmony. Although the genre gets quite a bad name among hardcore rock fans, who see it as "wimpy" , it doesn't mean soft rock is without merit  . Soft rock songs often deal with themes like romantic relationships and everyday life in a thoughtful and complex way hard rock simply couldn't. We can learn from the passage that   _  .

  A: the Rolling Stones ignored African-American musicians' work
  B: soft rock focus more on melody and culture awareness

Question 278/400:
Who owns the large American companies that produce cars, washing machines, and television sets? They are owned by a large group of people called stockholders. A company must have money to build factories and to buy machinery. To get this money, it sells shares of stock . Each share of stock is a share in the ownership of the company. The person who buys a share of stock becomes a part owner of the company. He is called a stockholder. A company can have thousands of stockholders. Sometimes a very large company is owned by millions of stockholders. Few persons can afford to buy a whole company, but the average individual can become part owner of a business. He can save his dollars and buy a share of stock in a large company. A person does not have to be wealthy to be a stockholder. When a company makes money, each stockholder may receive a dividend  check, which is his share of the profits . Parts of a company's profits are not paid out to the stockholders. This money is used by the company so it can grow larger. If the company does well, its shares of stock become more valuable. More than 20 million people own shares of stock in America's companies. By owning stock, they are helping America's businesses grow. They are also putting their money to work to earn more money. Why do companies keep part of their profits?
----------
  A: They want to buy the shares of stock, too.
  B: They cannot find all the names of their stockholders.
  C: They use the money to help the company grow larger.
  D: They think they have sent their stockholders enough money.

Question 279/400:
When you walk into the small Australian town of Coober Pedy, you may be surprised by what you can see. It's just barren   land there! So why even call it a town? There are more than 4,000 people of 48 nationalities. However, all of the people live underground! Coober Pedy was established  in 1915, following the discovery of opals  . The town is sometimes called the "opal capital of the world," because it is the largest opal mining area in the world. Due to a desert climate  , people came to realize that while working under the ground was easy, living above it was not. The solution was to move underground, by changing old mines into homes and establishing the world's first and most likely, only underground town. As years have gone by, the homes have become bigger. There are now also some hotels for tourists. They come from all over the world just to see this unusual town. Coober Pedy is probably best known for its unique style  of underground living. While the structures  may be located underground, they are in no way worse than those that lie above. Not only do their walls have the color of beautiful red, but also the structures have all the modern equipment like walk-in closets, modern kitchens and televisions. And the town also has gift shops selling opal jewelry, a couple of museums and even a church! Besides, Coober Pedy is also a favourite among filmmakers. And it has appeared in a series of movies such as Pitch Black, Red Planet and Opal Dream. The best title for this passage might be    _      .

  A: Opal Mining in Australia

Question 280/400:
Last week, I bought an alarm system for about $ 450. It consisted of a control unit with three small units.  I put the control unit in the sitting-room and fastened the other units by the front door, back door and living-room windows. The instructions told us to choose three numbers, so we chose 491, the last three numbers of our telephone number. Now I will explain how the alarm works: 1. There is a power siren in the control unit. It makes a very loud noise. 2. Each of the small units sends out beams or rays in different directions. If anything moves, it breaks a beam. This sends signal to the control unit. The siren makes a noise which you can hear 50 meters away. 3. When we go to bed, I press the three buttons numbered 4, 9 and 1. Then we have 30 seconds to get out of the room before the alarm starts to work. That night I slept soundly because I was sure that no burglar could get into our house. However, at about 2:10 a. m. , I woke up and heard the siren. "There must be a burglar in the house?" Mary said, "What shall we do?" "I'll go and see who's there," I said, "Stay here. Don't make a noise. " I went down stairs quietly. When I reached the living-room, I switched on my torch and looked round the room. Then I turned the light on. I switched the siren off and searched the rooms downstairs. There was nothing wrong except that the back door was unlocked. I locked it, re-set the alarm and went back to bed. About an hour later, the alarm started again. I jumped out of bed, fell over a chair in the dark and bumped into the bedroom door. Mary woke up and started hitting me with a torch. "Hey! Wait a minute!" I whispered, "It's only me. I'm going downstairs to see what's wrong." I went down into the living-room and listened for a moment. The only sound I could hear was the siren. I tamed on the light and switched the siren off. As I did so, I glanced across at the curtains in front of the windows. I saw a house lizard (a kind of small animals)  disappear behind the curtains. "Oh!" I said to myself. "That's our burglar." When the lizard moved, it started the siren. I guessed the alarm had been made in Europe, where there are no house lizards. Well, I won't finish this story but if you want an alarm system free of charge, let me know. I'll send you ours. We bought a dog this morning. It knows the difference between a lizard and a burglar . The writer used numbers 4, 9 and 1 to  _  .
----------
  A: set the alarm system
  B: make a telephone call
  C: give numbers to each of the three units in the downstairs rooms

Question 281/400:
LONDON, England(CNN)-- The youngest person to sail solo around the world returned home Thursday from his 30,000-mile, 282-day ocean journey. Mike Perham, 17, sailed into Lizard Point in Cornwall, the southernmost point in Britain, at 9:47 a.m., his race team said. "It feels  ly brilliant," Mike told CNN by phone hours before crossing the finish line. "I'm really, really excited to be going across the line at last. It doesn't feel like long since I crossed it first." Mike set off on his round-the-world trip on November 18, 2008. He has been sailing his yacht, TotallyMoney.com, single-handedly, though a support team has been sailing next to him along the way. ks5u The teen has now achieved the title of Youngest Sailor to Circumnavigate the Globe Solo, according to the Guinness World Records. Mike learned how to sail when he was seven years old from his father, Peter and at age 14, he sailed across the Atlantic alone. The teenager's school -- which Mike describes as "highly supportive" of his trip -- has redesigned his coursework to fit in with his trip. It also gave him some coursework to do during "quiet moments," according to Mike's Website. There haven't been many of those quiet moments. Repeated autopilot failures forced him to stop for repairs in Portugal, the Canary Islands, South Africa, and twice in Australia, according to his Web site. Bad weather in the Southern Ocean -- between Australia and Antarctica -- forced Mike to battle 50ft waves and 57 mph winds. He said at one point, a "freak wave" picked up the boat and turned it on its side.  "My feet were on the ceiling at the time," he told CNN. "That was a really hairy moment, and I was certainly thinking, 'Why am I here?' But we took the sails off and the day after I thought, 'This is brilliant!'" Mike describes his father as his biggest hero, always supportive of what he wanted to achieve. Peter Perham said he wasn't too worried about his son facing dangerous situations at sea, as long as he knew what to do and stayed safe. Mike Perham returned to Britain in   _  .

Question 282/400:
Though problems are a part of our lives, it certainly doesn't mean that we let them rule our lives forever. One day or the other, you'll have to stand up and say -- problem, I don't want you in my life. Of course, we've been fighting troubles ever since we were born. Problems with friends, parents, girlfriends, husbands, and children -- the list goes on. Apart from these, the inner conflicts within ourselves work, too. These keep adding to our problems. Problems come in different shapes and colors and feelings. But good news is that all problems can be dealt with. Now read on to know how to solve your problems. Talk, it really helps. What most of us think is that our problem can be understood only by us and that no talking is going to help. But the truth is that when you talk about, you're setting free the negative energies that have been gathering within you. Talking helps you move on and let go. Write your problems. Having a personal diary can also be of huge help if you don't want a real person to talk with. When you write down your problems, you're setting free all the tension from your system. You can try throwing away the paper on which you wrote your problems. By doing this, imagine yourself throwing away the problems from your life. Don't lose faith and hope. No matter what you lose in life, don't lose faith and hope. Even if you lose all your money, family ..., you should still have faith. With faith and hope, you can rebuild everything that you lose. Your problems aren't the worst. No matter what problem you get in life, there're another one million people whose problems are huger than yours. Tell yourself: when they can deal with them, why can't I? Your problems might just seem big and worse, but in reality they can be removed. Go about and solve your problems because every problem, however big or small, always has a way out. What is the text mainly about?
----------
  A: How to find problems.
  B: How to change problems.
  C: How to live without problems.

Question 283/400:
What's your opinion about gun control in the US? Figures tell a different story: Countries that allow their citizens to carry guns seem to have more killings than those that do not allow them. It's easy to kill with a gun. The media is filled with violence. People, especially young people, watch television. Having a gun does not cause someone to kill. The problem is within that person's mind. Controlling guns will not control killing. Changing the mindset will, however. --- Bobby Walker, U.S. Guns are deadly to all others who are near or know someone who has one. People don't understand the danger it holds, and don't realize what will happen just by cleaning it of if a younger child gets a hold of it. This weapon  is dangerous and we don't need teens, kids, anyone to have them. Society can get along without guns. ---Ann Miller, U.S I have a very large farm near Austin, Texas, USA. Because it is far from the city, I need to protect my property  and cattle from thieves and wild dogs. The wildlife, such as coyotes and puma , can feed on deer, mice, rabbits--they don't bother me and I don't bother them. I lost 45 animals to thieves that cut a fence. This will never happen again. You ask if I would shoot--of course--that's why I carry a gun. --- Texas Rancher, U.S Some people think guns are very bad because they lead to violence. In my opinion, when people kill themselves or others, they do not have any feelings because they do not know anything about love, sympathy , and promise. The only way those persons can get these feelings is when they keep close to family, friends and people who matter to them. Now, having a gun is not a problem: the problem is what the people feel when they use one. ---Connie Faille, Colombia Bobby Walker's attitude towards the media might be   _

Question 286/400:
It remains a curiosity and a bit of a historical mystery why we don't all drive on the same side of the road. The fact is that most people are right-handed; that's why, for much of history, drivers have stuck to the left. Ancient Romans using two-wheeled carriages are believed to have held the reins  with their right hands and a whip with their left; to avoid whipping the near drivers, they favored the left-hand side the road. It's also easier for right-handers to get on a horse from the left, so riders were attracted to that side to avoid the near traffic as they climbed on and off. Finally, knights  and the other drivers favored the left so they could do battle, if necessary, with their good hand. So why does most of the world travel on the right side today? Theories differ, but there's no doubt Napoleon was a major influence. The French have used the right since the late 18th century.  Some say that before the French Revolution, people in upper class drove their carriages on the left, forcing the _ to the right. During the violence, fearful rich people sought to mix with the peasantry by traveling on the right as well. Regardless of the origin, Napoleon brought right-hand traffic to the nations he conquered, including Russia, Switzerland and Germany. Hitler, in turn, ordered right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia and Austria in the 1930s. Nations that escaped right-handed conquest, like Great Britain, kept their left-handed tradition. Who had a major effect on "keep-right" traffic law?

  A: Ancient Romans

Question 288/400:
It is good to keep animals in zoos. Zoos are places for people to see many different kinds of animals from all over the world. Without zoos, most people would never see a real tiger or bear. Secondly, zoos look after the animals very well. The animals are always given food and cleaned on time. In the wild, it is not always possible for an animal to find food, so sometimes it goes hungry. Thirdly, Zoos protect the animals. They give them safe place to live in. In the wild, some kinds of animals are in danger. If there is no zoos, there would be fewer kinds of animals in the world. However, some people think it is unnatural  and unfair to keep wild animals in cages. Some cages are too small for many animals such as bears and tigers. They always look not happy in cages. Wild animals should look for their own food. Anyone would not feel happy if he isn't allowed  to go outside his home and animals don't like it either. In the wild,   _

  A: Animals can eat enough food.

Question 289/400:
Patten suffered from a serious, though not immediately life-threatening, impairment of his circulatory system. Patten's cardiologist recommended a cardiac bypass operation and referred Patten to Dr. Cutter. Cutter did not inform Patten of the 2% risk of death associated with this operation. Cutter defended his decision not to mention the risk statistics to Patten because "Patten was a worrier and it would significantly lessen his chances of would significantly lessen his chances of survival to be worried about the nonsurvival rate." Cutter successfully performed the bypass operation and Patten made a good recovery. However, when Patten learned of the 2% risk of death associated with the operation, he was furious that Cutter had failed to disclose this information to him. If Patten asserts a claim against Cutter based on negligence, will Patten prevail? 
----------
  A: No, if Cutter used his best personal judgment in shielding Patten from the risk statistic. 
  B: No, because the operation was successful and Patten suffered no harm. 
  C: Yes, if Patten would have refused the operation had he been informed of the risk. 
  D: Yes, because a patient must be told the risk factor associated with a surgical procedure in order to give an informed consent.

Question 292/400:
There are several ways to break the technology code that teenagers have written among themselves. The following are ideas to help parents understand the sometimes confusing world of the teens. SocialNetworking  Sites: Sites like MySpace and Facebook _ all generations and are a good way for a parent to understand what social standards your teen is living with. There are many ways to help you take part in your child's online activities. You also can be from an onlooker   who keeps a bird' s-eye view of his cyber world to an active member of his social group. MMORPG: Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game comes in the form of games. A child can easily become addicted to   them if no limits are set. To fully understand the attraction behind MMORPG, you can make your own account and character to explore the digital   world. Playing the online games may seem strange at first to your teen, but experience has led me to only positive feedback   from young people who can communicate with adults about their gaming experiences. Text and Instant Messenger: The ways of teenage communication have produced a whole new language, such as "LOLZ" (laughing out loud) and "PSOS" (parent standing over shoulder). Learning the basic shorthand   of teens can open up a whole new world of communication, not only talking to your teens, but being able to listen on their terms as well. You may just find yourself texting faster and ending your correspondence   with TTYL (talk to you later). To teens, texting anyone looks cool, even Mom and Dad. Email: Emailing your child is easy. This, of course, cannot take the place of face-to-face communication, but it provides another way for your child to reach you. Another benefit is that your child cannot act like he didn't hear you. According to this passage we can infer that the author's child   _  .

Question 293/400:
Doctor are known to Be terriBle pilots. They don't listen Because they already know it all. I was lucky: Became a pilot in 1970, almost ten years Before I graduated from medical school. I didn't realize then, But Becoming a pilot makes me a Better surgeon. I loved flying. As I flew Bigger, faster planes, and in worse weather. I learned aBout crew resource management  , or CRM, a new idea to make flying safer. It means that crew memBers should listen and speak up for a good result, regardless of positions. I first read aBout CRM in 1980. Not long after that, an attending doctor and I were flying in Bad weather. The controller had us turn too late to get our landing ready. The attending doctor was flying; I was safety pilot He was so Busy Because of the Bad turn, he had forgotten to put the landing gear   down. He was a Better pilot - and my Boss - so it felt unusual to speak up. But I had to: Our lives were in danger. I put aside my uneasiness and said, "We need to put the landing gear down now!" That was my first real lesson in the power of CRM, and I've used it in the operating room ever since. CRM requires that the pilot/surgeon encourage others to speak up. It further requires that when opinions are from the opposite, the doctor doesn't overreact, which might prevent fellow doctors from voicing opinions again. So when I'm in the operating room, I ask for ideas and help from others. Sometimes they're not willing to speak up. But I hope that if I continue to encourage them , someday someone will keep me  from " ". What dose the author say aBout doctors in general?
----------
  A: They like flying By themselves.
  B: They are unwilling to take advice.
  C: They pretend to Be good pilots.
  D: They are quick learners of CRM.

Question 294/400:
I love to tell the story about how I met my best friend---- Tiger. We met at the school fair. Each year, all the fourth-grade classes hold a school fair. Everyone in the fourth-grade works at the fair. Some sell ice cream, drinks and snacks. Others take care of the little children who ride the rides. I got the second job and I've never regretted it, because that's where I met Tiger. My job was to help little children get on the back of a little horse. I kept telling the children to wait their turn and holding ice cream for them while they rode about. One thing was clear to me. I was growing older and should be more responsible. Suddenly, a boy came to the horse. He took the little horse's reins! The horse stopped, and the girl on its back started to fall. I was trying to reach the girl when I saw Tiger go by my legs. It held the horse's reins and pulled the horse away from my legs. I caught the girl just before we both hit the ground. The girl sat on top of me. She was laughing at the ice cream on my face. The horse's reins were in Tiger's mouth! Thanks to Tiger's fast action, I saved the little girl. We were both heroes. And Tiger, the fastest dog I've even known became my new best friend.

Question 295/400:
Yesterday,I overheard our 9-year-old son,Aaron,talking to his friend,Zach. "Oh,God!"Zach began,looking in Aaron's closet "Where are all your toys?" "Oh,we are doing something called Simplicity plan,so I basically got rid of 80% of my stuff . " "What? Did your mom and dad make you do this?" "No, Idecided to do it because I wanted to.When I give away a lot of my things,I make room for family activities. I did it because I wanted to live differently and have less stuff in my life." "But still,why would you choose to get rid of most of your toys?" "Part of the reason is that my parents were doing it with their stuff .And my mom talked to me about it and explained how they felt happier afterwards. And I thought maybe I really had spent a lot of my time in my room playing with toys instead of spending time with my parents and sister." "Seriously?" "I feel proud because I am a person who has just what I need and not more. And I'm starting new activities like writing how I feel,reading more,and spending more time doing housework around the house." "OK.Let me get this. You have fewer toys,more housework,and you feel happier?" "Well, it's not that the housework is fun ,But I do it with my parents. We talk and connect while we are doing it, so that is the fun.And we've been doing more activities together, like reading aloud at night. And on weekends,we have conversations or go out together, instead of my dad being at his computer,my mom cleaning and me playing with my toys." We can learn from the passage that Aaron  _  .

Question 296/400:
Fame troubled Marie Curie and also her husband, because science was their world and in their world of science fame and honor had no value. One day, when a writer for a newspaper tried to ask Marie about herself and her thoughts and her belief, she answered him, "In science we must be interested in things, not in persons." Much of the real character and spirit of this unusual woman is found in these few words, which she was later often to repeat. One evening, at a big party, a friend asked if she would like to see the king of Greece, who was also a guest. She answered in her simple manner, "I don't see the value of it." Then, seeing that she had hurt the feeling of her friend, she quickly added, "But...but...of course, I shall do whatever you please, just as you please. Marie Curie's friend was interested in   _  .

Question 297/400:
We all enjoy the colors of autumn leaves. Did you ever wonder how and why a fall leaf changes color? Where do the yellows and oranges come from? To answer those questions, we first have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. They take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose, which is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis, which means " putting together with light. " A chemical called chlorophyll helps make photosynthesis happen. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how the trees "know" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. The trees will rest, and live off the food they stored during summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange colors. Small a-mounts of these colors have been in the leaves all along. Covered up by the green chlorophyll, we just can't see them in summer. The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in the fall. In some trees, like maples, glucose is trapped in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn cause the leaves turn this glucose into a red color. The brown color of trees like oaks is made from wastes left in the leaves. It is the combination of all these things that make the beautiful colors we enjoy in the fall. Which of the following is True according to the passage?
----------
  A: Trees don't change colours with seasons.
  B: Trees can still perform photosynthesis well in winter.
  C: Trees have colours like yellow and orange even in summer.
  D: Trees don't need food in winter.

Question 298/400:
Maddie Messe, 13, has always loved Temple Run, a mobile game that sends her racing through swamps   and forests to outrun a pack of crazed monkeys. What she didn't love was being forced to play as a boy -- unless she was willing to buy a female version. "I felt like l was being cheated or misrepresented," Maddie explains."Girls are just as capable   of running away from monkeys as boys are." So last winter, Maddie researched 50 of the most popular iPhone games. What she found was infuriating:90 percent offered free male characters, but only 15 percent let you play as a female for free. Armed with those statistics, Maddie drafted a spirited article and fired it off to several major newspapers. The Washington Post agreed to run the piece, which attracted millions of readers around the globe -- including the makers of Temple Run! "We realized she had a point," says Natalia Luckyanova, the game's co-creator. "It was the kick in the pants we needed to say,'We should fix it.'So we did." Now you can play Temple Run with a female character for free, but Maddie hopes her campaign inspires something deeper."If you don't see characters that look like you on TV or in movies or games, speak up! Just do your research first,"says Maddie. "One well-supported argument is much more effective than a million angry complaints." To Natalia Luckyanova, Maddie's article sounded  _  .

Question 300/400:
GOLDEN, British Columbia (AP)---A 3-year-old girl found alive in the upside down wreckage of an airplane survived because she was  _ in a car seat, rescuers said. They said they knew she was OK when she cried for her teddy bear. Sunday's crash killed Kate Williams' pilot-grandfather, Allen D. Williams, 65, and another passenger, authorities said. The plane was found nose down and turned over in the icy water at the edge of a riverbank in the mountains of southeast prefix = st1 /British Columbia. "What saved her life was being strapped into that car seat," said Mike Plonka, a member of the search-and-rescue team. "You could see that she was very frightened. Her big concern at the time was her little teddy bear. She didn't want to leave without it. . . " "She was just pointing at it and calling it 'Baby'. " he said Monday. The girl suffered head injuries but was reported as stable, hospital officials in Golden said. She was reunited with her parents.  Police said the Cessna 172 was on its way to Edmontonwhen it took off from Golden around 1 pm Sunday into low clouds and snow. Visibility was poor. An hour later, the Search and Rescue Centre in Victoria picked up the plane's emergency signal from somewhere near the BlaeberryRiver. A team using a hand-held beacon locator found the wreckage, and two military search and rescue technicians--Sgt. Scott Elliston and Master Cpl. Bruno Lapointe---landed nearby in a helicopter. As they checked for survivors, they discovered the girl alive but surrounded by debris in the back of the plane. The two soldiers tried to remove her from the wreckage, but she made it clear she didn't want to leave without her teddy bear.  "I got her out and I handed her to Bruno. She was calling out for her teddy bear. I picked up the teddy bear to give it to her but it was covered with snow. She wasn't too happy that it was covered with snow so I brushed it off. "Elliston said.  Williams was CEO and founder of Edmonton-based A. D. Williams Engineering Inc. The passenger who was killed, Steven T. Sutton, was chief financial officer. The two had been attending a business meeting in Golden. The cause of the accident was under investigation. What is the cause of the accident?

Question 305/400:
FOR thousands of years, Stonehenge has confused visitors with a seemingly unanswerable question: Why would anyone carry so many huge stones across Britain and put them in a ring? It seems even stranger when you think of the fact that it was done by prehistoric people working without modern technology, not even a wheel. Stonehenge has started endless debates over the centuries. Experts have said at different times that it was a temple, a calendar   or a graveyard  . Yet "all the ideas to date could be mistaken," said Julian Spalding, a famous art critic   and former director of some of the UK's leading museums. "We've been looking at Stonehenge the wrong way: from the earth, which is very much a 20th century viewpoint," he told The Guardian. Spalding has put forward a new theory about Stonehenge in his latest book, Realisation: From Seeing to Understanding. "The current theories about Stonehenge are based on looking across the ground, which is a modern idea," he writes in his new book. He told The Guardian that in ancient times, spiritual ceremonies didn't happen on the ground. Prehistoric people believed that in this way they could get closer to the heavens. So Spalding says that "rituals   at Stonehenge were performed in the same way - not among the stones, but on top of them," reported The Washington Post. He re-imagines a scene in his book, explaining how the mysterious site was used: Stonehenge held up a large, circular platform  . It was a raised altar   reached by stairs, and thousands of people might have worshipped   there. To support his theory, Spalding lists examples from ancient civilizations worldwide. In China, Peru and Turkey, such sacred   monuments   were built high up, whether on man-made or natural sites. In an interview with The Washington Post, Spalding said the wood that would have been used for the platform had long since rotted away  , leaving only the stone pillars   that supported it behind. So far scholars have had "a fair degree of skepticism  " about these ideas, according to The Huffington Post. Sir Barry Cunliffe, prehistorian and Oxford University archaeology   professor, said: "He could be right, but I know of no evidence to support it ... There are a large number of stone circles around the country which clearly didn't have a platform on top. So why should Stonehenge?" According to Spalding's theory, Stonehenge   _  .
----------
  A: was a prehistoric calendar
  B: should be looked at from the earth
  C: was a raised altar for worship
  D: was simply a natural site

Question 306/400:
Happiness is like a stone dropped into a pool to set in motion an ever-widening circle of ripples . As Stevenson has said, being happy is a duty. There is no exact definition of the world happiness. Happy people are happy for all sorts of reasons. They key is not wealth or physical well--being, since we find beggars, patients and so-called failures who are extremely happy. Being happy is a sort of unexpected dividend . But staying happy is an achievement, a victory of soul and character. It is not selfish to struggle for it. It is, indeed, a duty to ourselves and others.  Being unhappy is like an infectious disease; it causes people to stay away from the fufferer. He soon finds himself alone, miserable and upset. There is, however, a cure so simple as to seem, at first glance, ridiculous: If you don't feel happy, pretend to be! It works. Before long you will find that instead of repelling people, you attract them. You discover how deeply rewarding it is to be the center of wider and wider circles of good will. Then the  _ becomes a reality. You possess the secret of peace of mind, and can forget yourself in being of service to others. Being happy, once it is realized as a duty and established as habit, opens doors into unimaginable gardens crowded with grateful friends. We can learn from the passage that_.
----------
  A: everyone has the same happiness and different unhappiness
  B: people generally try to keep away from those who are always unhappy
  C: people who are rich and healthy are surely happy
  D: being happy is the key to success in your work

Question 307/400:
Some parents say their kids don't like sports. Why? Some kids don't like sports because they don't know how to play them. If the kids know how to play a new sport, maybe they will like it. Taking P.E. classes at school is a good way to learn new sports. Another way is to watch videos about sports. Kids can also read some books to learn new sports. Some kids don't like playing sports because they were once on a team and didn't have fun. For those kids, it's a good idea to talk with their teachers or parents. With their help, maybe the kids will like playing sports again. There are many kinds of sports, so a kid should find the sports that _ him or her. If a kid doesn't like team sports, parents can ask him or her to try individual  sports, such as swimming and running. Playing sports is a good form of exercise, and it can help kids keep active and healthy. Of course, non-sport   activities can also keep kids fit, such as walking a dog, cleaning the room and watering the garden. Which activity is NOT mentioned in the passage?
----------
  A: Watering the garden.
  B: Walking a dog.
  C: Playing basketball.
  D: Cleaning the room.

Question 309/400:
"The price of books for our students is just getting higher and higher and,combined with the rising cost of tuition,it's killing these students,"said Peter Jason,a college professor."Remember,students are one of the poorest groups of people in America.Almost half of them have at least one part-time job.In fact,one of my students has three jobs.And she still manages to have high scores and go to school full-time." Textbook prices are traditionally high.Adding to that problem,many college teachers change textbooks year after year;they either upgrade to a new edition or switch to an entirely different textbook.This further hurts students because if an instructor no longer uses a particular textbook,that book has no resale value. Dr.Jason decided to make lire a little easier and a lot cheaper for his students by writing his own book on public speaking."Many books have an increased price because of CD-ROMs,lots of color photographs and pictures.I talked to my students,and many of them,like me,prefer to keep things simple! So,a few years ago,I wrote my own textbook.Compared to most other public speaking books,mine is half the number of pages,and one-third the price.That is,$30 instead of $90.When I wrote a second edition last year,students only had to buy the 35 new pages, For only $7.00,they had almost a new book. Now my loose-leaf textbook enjoys great popularity among the students.Maybe in the future more writers and publishers will try it." What did Dr. Jason say about students at college?
----------
  A: They are short of money.
  B: They need better textbooks
  C: They should do part-time jobs.
  D: They are trying to get high scores.

Question 310/400:
There are several reasons for hair loss in women. However, in most cases, treatment is quite effective. Female hair loss patterns in women are not as easily recognizable as they are in men. A woman may experience it temporarily due to pregnancy or illness, although they may experience it for other reasons. Hair loss can be due to a variety of factors, including a genetic tendency (which is not genetically linked to just one parent--both parents contribute to the tendency to lose hair). Women who are experiencing hair problems seem to have more limited choices than men. There are some female hair loss treatments that are available such as the Tricomin System which is a topical treatment that is nutrition based. Shen Min for Women is another natural treatment that contains herbs   that are said to stimulate  hair growth and even restore hair that is graying to its natural color1. The majority of the popular, prove hair loss treatments are only intended for men and are not suitable for women. True, a woman's hair issue is different from a man's. The biological makeup is different and the needs are different. Women have different needs and their bodies react in different ways to environmental changes, physical illness and even the treatments that are available. There are many natural treatments such as vitamin and mineral supplements that are said to stimulate hair growth, but, for the most part, these claims are currently unproven. One of the first and most important factors to effectively treating is to get a diagnosis from a doctor. Talk to your doctor about any symptoms  that you may be experiencing in addition to the thinning hair. Stress, weight loss or gain, illness and depression, all of these can be contributing factors. The reasons for the differences between the female and male hair loss problems do not include_.
----------
  A: The biological structure and composition of the hair
  B: The wants and needs
  C: The reactions and responses to the outside changes
  D: The approach to taking exercise

Question 311/400:
If you think about World Heritage Sites, you probably think of places associated with ancient art and culture, historical building and monuments. And of course, many of these are on the World Heritage List .But the WHL contains a lot of sites that are not so obvious. Let's look at a few of them.    Robben Island in South Africa   This island was used through the centuries as a prison, a hospital and a military base. But it's probably the most famous as a prison for political prisoners in the twentieth century. Nelson Mandela was one of its residents. The WHL says it represents "the victory of democracy  and freedom over oppression and racism "    The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in India    This railway was opened in 1881 and is still operating today. It crossed a difficult area of mountain landscape and it is a great example of railway engineering. The WHL says that it is "the first, and still the most outstanding example of a hill passenger railway."    Borders of France and Spain    This is an area of great natural beauty and the mountains have many interesting geological formations. But it is also an area of small farms. Surprisingly, people there still use a type of agriculture that used to be common in mountainous areas of Europe but has almost completely disappeared in modern times.    Alto Douro, Portugal    This is an area in the North of Portugal where wine has been produced for thousands of years. The WHL says that this long tradition of wine making "has produced a cultural landscape of outstanding beauty that reflects its technological, social and economic evolution".    Rio Platano Reserve, Honduras    The WHL says that this site is "one of the few remains of a humid tropical forest in Central America". It's a mountainous area on the Caribbean coast with many different species of plants and animals. The people who have always lived there still have the same traditional life-style.    Simien National Park, Ethiopia    Simien National Park was one of the first sites listed in 1978. It is one of the highest mountain area in Africa, and the WHL calls it "one of the most spectacular landscapes in the world". It is also important for its wildlife. The population of some rare animals is getting smaller and smaller. The passage mainly deals with  _  .
----------
  A: the remains of ancient cultures on the WHL
  B: all the heritage sites on the WHL
  C: a few of the more unusual sites on the WHL
  D: places of artistic or cultural importance

Question 312/400:
The Chinese Antarctica expedition returned to Shanghai on March 20 following a month living on the ice. It was the first time Chinese scientists had visited the Amery Ice Shelf--the longest ice shelf in the world. The team collected ice samples and data on temperatures, which are necessary for research on global warming. So far, about 27 countries have visited Antarctica for scientific research. Although the living conditions are very hard, many scientists have to stay there for long periods of time. So, how do they manage their lives on the ice? Well, during the summer, the temperature in Antarctica reaches about-20degC. It falls to about-60degCin winter. So, even if there are 24 hours of sunshine, scientists must keep wearing all the correct clothes to protect them from the cold. These clothes include jeans, running shoes, jackets, long underwears, boots and woolen socks. Although highly technical clothing provides much protection against the extreme cold, scientists often need to go outside when there is an icy wind blowing and the temperature is-30degC. Natural protection such as facial hair can also help. "That's why many researchers wear a beard. It really does keep you warm,"says German explorer Arved Fuchs. Usually, the polar researchers have good meals. Some even have feasts on holidays like Christmas and New Year's Day. Vegetables are always welcome and usually finished the quickest. Life on the ice means living with other researchers in tight living space. Most people sleep in dorm style rooms. More remote field camps use separate tents. So, at least some researchers don't have to _ annoying snorers . But what do they do for fun in their spare time?  There are actually a lot of things they can do. They watch movies, read tons of books, listen to music, have saunas ,paint and ski. Some female researchers might even do some knitting. It is important for a polar researcher to be in good physical condition. They can be required to climb to heights of more than 3, 000 meters. And the Antarctic atmosphere has less oxygen than that of any other continent. Why do some polar researchers wear beards? Because   _  .
----------
  A: they have no time to shave their beards
  B: beards are helpful to keep warm
  C: beards will come out soon when they are shaved
  D: they think beards will make them look handsome

Question 313/400:
Crash. Shatter. Boom. Crash. Shatter. Boom. Smattering of silly dialogue. Pretty girl screams: "Dad!" Crash. Shatter. Boom. Crash. Shatter. Boom. Silly dialogue. "Dad!!!" Crash. Shatter. Boom. What? Oh, sorry. We were falling into a trance there. Which is, dear moviegoer, what may happen to you during Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction, the fourth Transformers film and lasts 165 minutes, which is precariously   close to the three-hour mark that Bay undoubtedly will reach--by our sophisticated calculations, and at the current growth rate, with his sixth installment . But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Despite what you've just read, this film will likely be a massive hit because by now, if you're buying a Transformers ticket, you surely know what you're getting into, and you want more, more, more. And Bay is the Master of More. Or just take it from the 11-year-old sitting  next to me, who reserved any audible judgment--he, too was in a trance, though maybe from sugar intake--until the moment he saw a Transformer become a dinosaur. Overwhelmed by the pairing, he proclaimed, "That's the sickest thing I've ever seen in my life." It was as if peanut butter and jelly had been tasted together for the first time. This time, there's a whole new human cast. Most important, Mark Wahlberg has replaced Shia LaBeouf as well, Main Human Guy. A significant part of the movie also takes place in China--clearly a nod to the franchise's huge market in the country. In any case, we begin in Paris, Texas, where Cade Yeager (Wahlberg), a struggling inventor, is desperatlely seeking a big discovery. He's also a widowed dad, and super-protective (as the movie constantly reminds us) of his high-school daughter, Tessa (Nicola Peltz, blond and pretty and ineffective, though the one-note script does her no favors). One day, Cade buys a rusty old truck. Examining it back home, he soon discovers it's none other than Optimus Prime, the Autobot hero, seriously damaged. As Cade works on fixing him up, his assistant, witty surfer-dude Lucas, has the dumb idea of calling the authorities. What he doesn't know is that the government is plotting to destroy all remaining Autobots in favor of a man-made army of Transformers. So now, it's evil humans that pitted against the trustworthy Autobots. So much for gratitude. There's also a subplot involving Tessa and her secret boyfriend, Shane (Jack Reynor, underused), whose Irish accent leads Cade to dismissively call him "Lucky Charms"--at least until the two bond in battle. The obvious question: Is it too much for its own good? Bay is vey talented at all things visual. The 3-D works well and the robots look great. But the final confrontation   alone lasts close to an hour. At some point, you may find yourself simply in a daze, unable to absorb any further action into your brain. The tone of the passage as a whole can be described as   _  ?

Question 314/400:
Many people write to newspaper and magazines to express their opinions. Letters to the editor must carry the writer's full name, address and telephone number, although the information is not necessary for publication. This requirement to provide personal particulars is a clear indication that writers are held responsible for what they say. When a writer wants his voice heard, he needs to claim ownership of his voice. Responsibility is the name of the game. "People today prefer living together to putting their signatures on a marriage certificate because they refuse to accept responsibility for the relationship," said social worker Ken Yip, "and this is what is causing a lot of family problems." When we sign a paper, for example, a business contract or a bank document, the signature is a seal of consent, an agreement to take the matter seriously. Most governments and many organizations will not process written complaints if they do not bear the writer's signature. The absence of a signature, they explain, tells us that the writer cannot be too serious and therefore does not deserve a reply. There are people who wish to remain anonymous for various reasons. Multi-billionaire Mr. King donates generously to charity several times a year. He gives simply because he wants to help but not for the publicity his donations may bring, and he does not want his good deeds to make news. In other cases, people insist on anonymity because they are afraid of the consequences of revealing their identity. Crime witnesses may be willing to assist the police, but most are unwilling to give their names when reporting a crime. Name or no name? The answer is very personal and lies in how much we want to get involved. We all have a name. It is a matter if responsibility to use it when we make a statement, a claim or an accusation. We all want to honor our own name, and it is only by stamping our expression of an opinion with our own name that we honor what we say. The passage is mainly about   _  .
----------
  A: honor and writers
  B: identity and signature
  C: signature and responsibility
  D: anonymity and signature

Question 315/400:
Most people today think of sleep as one continuous period of downtime.This is not the way people used to sleep.According to researchers,in earlier times,people divided sleep by first sleeping a few hours,waking up,then going back to sleep.In the first period,you would typically sleep until midnight or shortly afterwards.Halfway through the night,you came out of first sleep,you would stay in bed and relax quietly.It was called the watching period.Then you would start to feel sleepy.so would return to bed and tall asleep again for your second sleep.This period would continue until early morning when daylight arrived.With no artificial lighting in homes,people naturally woke up early to take advantage of sunlight. Before the 18th century, people had no gas or electricity in their homes.Fire,candles,or oil lamps were the common forms of lighting.This lack of artificial lighting in homes contributed to people's sleep patterns.It made sense for people to go to bed early. Today,human may consider divided sleep a strange habit,but sleep researchers say that it is actually a more natural sleep pattern.Dr.Thomas Wehr of the U.S.National Institute of Mental Health has studied human sleep.He thinks that modern sleep problems occur because the older, natural way of sleep is breaking through the more recent continuous sleep pattern.Wehr and other scientists believe that artificial lighting has altered the way people sleep.In a research study,he asked 15 adults to rest and sleep in darkness for 14 hours(from 6:00 P.M.to 8:00 A.M.).At first,the subjects took a few hours to get to sleep,and then slept 11 hours a night.Then overtime,they switched to divided sleep.They fell asleep for about three to five hours in the evening,stay awake for an hour or two,and then slept again for four hours till early morning. We modern humans generally do not practice divided sleep.However, many of us have the experience of waking up in the middle of the night.We usually consider this a sleeping"problem".but perhaps we should look at it as natural behavior.Divided sleep may be the way we should all be sleeping.A first sleep followed by a relaxation period and a second period of sleep could help all of us to beat the stress of our fast-paced lives. What conclusion does the author make about divided sleep?
----------
  A: It is one type of sleeping problems.
  B: It is not the best sleep pattern for everyone.
  C: It shouldn't be accepted by modern humans.
  D: It could be helpful for people to handle daily stress.

Question 316/400:
In Germany there are different kinds of high schools. Some prepare students for workers, others prepare them for college. All schools are great places for making friends and learning German. Short days Most high schools in Germany begin at about 8:00 a.m. and end at about 3:30 p.m. This means your morning will be busy with classes. You will have time to do homework and take part in private  clubs after school. Formal setting In Germany, teachers and students' relationship is more formal than you might be used to. Teachers are _ and students must use the formal "Sie(,)" when talking to teachers. Getting to school Most students take public transport to school or ride a bicycle. Some areas have school buses. It is not common for parents to drive students to school. Private clubs In many countries, schools offer official sports and after-school activities. This is less common in Germany. After-school activities are usually organized through private clubs. There are clubs for things like soccer, dance, choir, theatre and almost everything else. Once you are in Germany, ask around at school and talk to other students to find out what private clubs are in your area and meet your interests. Different states, different schools Each of Germany's 16 states has its own slightly different school systems. The school system in Brandenburg will be a little different from the system in Bavaria for example. Where you live, your knowledge level and your age will decide what school you can attend. From the passage, we can learn that in Germany   _  .
----------
  A: all kinds of high schools are for college
  B: age is not important for attending schools
  C: students can take part in after-school activities from 8:00 a. m .to 3:30 p.m.
  D: students can join private clubs to meet their interests by themselves

Question 317/400:
Tiny transmitters  fixed on the backs of the blue-green bees have allowed scientists to follow the insects as they fly for miles in search of rare flowers. Working in Panama, scientists caught 17 bees of the common species and fixed a 300 milligram radio light onto the back of each. The signals they sent out were used to follow their movements in and around the forest where they lived. Professor Martin, from Princeton University, US, and the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany, said, "By following the radio signals, we discovered that male bees spent most of their time in small centre areas, but could take off and visit areas farther away. One male even crossed over the shipping lanes in the Panama Canal, flying at least 5km, and returned a few days later." Researchers have struggled to follow the movements of bees before, following bees marked with paint or using radar which doesn't work well in forests. "Carrying the transmitter could reduce the distance that the bees travel, but even if the flight distances we record are the shortest distances that these bees can fly, they are impressive, long-distance movements," said Dr. Roland Kays, from New York State Museum, a co-author of the research published today in the on-line journal. "This result helps to explain how these bees' pollination  can be so rare." Pollination by bees and other insects is the key to the diversity and continued growth of flowers and trees in some forests. The new study is the first to use radio transmitters to follow bees in a forest. Similar research may now be carried in temperate forests, where bees also play a vital role. The main purpose of the passage is to  _
----------
  A: call on people to protect the bees for the environment
  B: explain why the bees fly far away in search of flowers
  C: introduce a modern way to follow the bees to readers
  D: encourage the public to support the scientists' research

Question 318/400:
Oleksander Pylyshenko is either very fearless,very foolish... or both. The 40-year-old zookeeper from the Ukraine recently spent five weeks in a cage with Katya, a 200-kilo African lioness. Why? Well for a start, he wanted to raise awareness of the treatment of animals in captivity. Secondly, he hoped to break the Guinness World Record for time spent living in a cage with a lion. And thirdly? "I wanted to show my children what kind of man I am," said Oleksander.  For 36 days, Oleksander and Katya shared the cage together. They ate hunks of meat thrown into the cage by Oleksander's wife, and slept side by side on a bed of hay. Oleksander did have a few more creature comforts than his feline flatmate - he built himself a shower and toilet inside the enclosure. But he didn't use any soap as the sharp scent is upsetting to lions. And as if living with the king of the jungle wasn't dangerous enough, Katya was also pregnant at the time. She gave birth during Oleksander's stay. Wild animals are very protective of their young but the zookeeper said Katya trusted him completely. Oleksander' wife, Olena, was also very trusting. "when he first told me about the plan I was very scared. But I decided to support my husband." Once the five weeks was up, Oleksander stepped out of the cage and declared the experiment a success. He told a Russian news agency, "Katya taught me a lot about honesty and kindness." Also, a representative from Guinness World Records confirmed that Oleksander ahd beaten the previous record by three weeks. But the parting was also bittersweet. "Katya was very sad to see me go," Oleksander noted. Oleksander's wife, on the other hand, was very happy to have her husband back. [(<<>> 20121 "Into the Lion's Den" )] Which is not the purpose of spending 5 weeks in cage with a lion according to Oleksander? [ ]
----------
  A: He wanted to raise awareness of the treatment of animals in cage.
  B: He hoped to break the Guinness World Record for time spent living in a cage with a lion.
  C: He wanted to show his children his kindness as a man.
  D: He wanted to earn money by taking the risk of living with a lion.

Question 319/400:
My parents have certainly had their troubles, and as their child I'll never know how they made it to 38 years of marriage. They loved each other, but they didn't seem to like each other very much. Dad was too fond of his beer, and he talked down to Mom a lot. When she tried to stand up to him, a fight would unavoidably follow. It was my dad's disease that began to change things. The year 1998 was the beginning of a remarkable transformation for my family. My father, Jim Dineen, the always healthy, weightlifting, never-missed-a-day-of-work kind of dad, discovered he had kidney  disease. The decision to go ahead with a transplant for my father was a long and tough one, mostly because he had liver damage too. One physician's assistant told him, "According to your file, you're supposed to be dead." And for a while, doctors mistakenly thought that he would need not just a kidney transplant, but a liver transplant too. _  When the donor testing process finally began in the spring of 2003, numerous people, including me, my uncle Tom, and my mom, came back as matches of varying degree. But Mom was the one who insisted on going further. She decided to donate a kidney to my father. She said she was not scared, and it was the right thing to do. We all stepped back in amazement. At last a date was chosen - November 11, 2003. All of a sudden, the only thing that seemed to matter Dad was telling the world what a wonderful thing Mom was doing for him. A month before the surgery, he sent her birthday flowers with a note that read, "I love you and I love your kidney! Thank you!" Financially, the disease was upsetting to them. So my sister and I were humbled and surprised when, shortly before his surgery day, Dad handed us a diamond jewelry that we were to give to Mom after the operation. He'd accumulated his spare dollars to buy it. At the hospital on the day of the transplant, all our relatives and friends gathered in the waiting room and became involved in a mean euchre   tournament. My family has always handled things with a lot of laughter, and even though we were all tense, everybody was taking bets on how long this "change of conduct" would last in my parents. We would inform Dad that if he chose to act like a real pain on any particular day after the operation, he wasn't allowed to blame it on PMS just because he'd now have a female kidney. The surgeries went well, and not long afterward, my sister and I were allowed to go in to visit. Dad was in a great deal of pain but again, all he could talk about was Mom. Was she okay? How was she feeling? Then the nurses let us do something unconventional. As they were wheeling Mom out of recovery room, they rolled her into a separate position to visit Dad. It was strange to see both my parents hooked up to IVs and machines and trying to talk to each other through tears. The nurses allowed us to present the diamond jewelry to Mom so that Dad could watch her open it. Everyone was crying, even the nurses. As I stood with digital camera in hand, I tried to keep the presence of mind to document the moment. My dad was having a hard time fighting back emotion, and suddenly my parents unexpectedly reached out to hold each other's hands. In my nearly 35 years of existence, I'd never seen my parents do that, and I was spellbound. I snapped a picture and later rushed home to make sure I'd captured that enormous, life-defining moment. After so many years of disagreement, it was apparent to me that they finally understood how much each loved the other. Which of the following is TRUE according the passage?
----------
  A: Dad bought a diamond jewelry to Mom for their wedding anniversary.
  B: Dad asked the nurse to visit Mom soon after the operation.
  C: Despite a lot of pain, Dad was eager to know Mom's condition soon after the operation.
  D: On the day of the transplant, the families involved in a euchre tournament to entertain themselves.

Question 320/400:
The personal computer has overtaken the family dog as man's best friend.according to a study. Researchers found that just 6 per cent of us believe that" most people rely more on their dog than they do on their PC",while 67 per cent think the opposite to be true. Even 38 per cent of dog owners admitted to relying more on their PC than on their dog, although 36 per cent disagreed. And 71 per cent of 18 to 24-year-old dog owners said they relied more on their computer. Paul Allen,editor of Computeractive magazine said:"These days you can even you're your PC for fl walk,provided you have a laptop or tablet." "It's only a matter of time until the first PC that fetches your slippers." Researchers questioned 2,000 British adults to find out the change modern technology has brought to their home life. They found that male dog owners are almost twice as likely as female owners to rely on their computer than a _ companion. Mr.Allen said:"With broadband bringing them global news and newspaper sales falling,the family dog even misses out on the pleasure of taking the paper to his owner." But it's not all bad news for obedient dogs. "The family PC has given dog owners access to a wealth of resources and information that can help with the long-term care that a dog needs,"Mr.Allen said. According to Mr. Allen,the personal computer
----------
  A: won't have effect on newspaper sales

Question 321/400:
You must know what BYD stands for? Yes, Build Your Dream. Have you built your dream and spare no effort to achieve it? Here is an inspiring story from http//www.naijamotiveation.com Eddie Arcaro dreamed of becoming the world's greatest jockey . But after watching him ride a horse for five minutes, reality reflected a rough contradiction. He was awkward and clumsy, and in his early years in the saddle( )he couldn't do one thing right. In his first 100 races he never even came close to winning. Still, he got right back on and trained again. Even as a schoolboy, Arcaro had set his own track in life. Because he was only a little over five feet tall (1.5 meters) and weighed barely 80 pounds (36kg), the other students _ him. So he skipped school, hanging out at the local race track where a trainer let him ride horses. His father reluctantly agreed to let him pursue a career as a jockey. The trainer had told him so. "Send him back to school," he said. "He'll never be a rider." In spite of that, Arcaro was determined not just to ride, but to become the world's greatest jockey. But first someone would have to give him a chance. He finally got to ride in a real race. Before it was over, he'd lost his whip and his cap and had almost fallen off the saddle. By the time he finished the race, the other horses were on their way to the stables . He'd come in dead last. Nevertheless, Arcaro went from track to track, looking for any opportunity to ride. Finally, a trainer who pitied him took him in and gave him a chance. One hundred losses later, he was still giving him chances. He saw something in this unlucky jockey, something he couldn't define. There were many brushes with death and several broken bones. Every time he would return to the saddle. Then Arcaro began to win. In thirty years of riding, he won 4, 779 races, becoming the only jockey in history to win the Kentucky Derby five times. By the time he retired in 1962 he was a millionaire and a legend in his own lifetime. The trainer who believed in Arcaro gave him chances because   _  .

Question 322/400:
Ozzie owned and occupied Blackacre, which was a tract of land improved with a onefamily house. His friend, Victor, orally offered Ozzie $50,000 for Blackacre, the fair market value, and Ozzie accepted. Because they were friends, they saw no need for attorneys or written contracts and shook hands on the deal. Victor paid Ozzie $5,000 down in cash and agreed to pay the balance of $45,000 at an agreed closing time and place. Before the closing, Victor inherited another home and asked Ozzie to return his $5,000. Ozzie refused, and, at the time set for the closing, Ozzie tendered a good deed to Victor and declared his intention to vacate Blackacre the next day. Ozzie demanded that Victor complete the purchase. Victor refused. The fair market value of Blackacre has remained $50,000. In an appropriate action brought by Ozzie against Victor for specific performance, if Ozzie loses, the most likely reason will be that 
----------
  A: the agreement was oral.
  B: keeping the $5,000 is Ozzie's exclusive remedy. 
  C: Victor had a valid reason for not closing.

Question 323/400:
" Yeah! Auntie is here! " screamed my husband's niece and nephew together. " Let me get the door!" " No, let me !" Each one's goal was to get there first and open the door for their Auntie, Me! I couldn't get enough of them, of their youthful love of life, and their excitement every time I visited! To be honest, it was partially because of the Surprise Travel Bag that I carried in. It was a tradition that I started when they were young. Each time I went to see them, I would take a large bag filled with toys, coloring books, candy, magic markers and "games". The contents  were different but the rules were not. They included: one may get a turn to choose what activity we would do; another may take a turn to go first when we played a game; ..... We shared the treats after the games and cleaned up after we played . Then, sadly, they watched the Surprise Travel Bag go away with their Auntie. Now my niece and nephew have grown into young adults. They spend most of their visits listening to their iPods, messaging on their phones.... I completely forgot that I had put my two Surprise Travel Bags in the basement  until my husband found them this weekend. I held the bags tightly in my arms, remembering our laughter and fun-filled get-togethers. My big decision now is to whom I will pass the Surprise Travel Bags so that the fun that the bags help to create can continue. Why did the author forget the Surprise Travel Bags?
----------
  A: Because she is too old to remember them.
  B: Because the children have grown up and have their own interests.
  C: Because she has put too many things in the basement.
  D: Because she doesn't like the children any longer.

Question 324/400:
You can't look good if you are not healthy. And one way to be healthy is to do exercise. Football, tennis, volleyball and swimming are all good for you. Muscle   exercise is also important. You can exercise at school or at home. Boys can do push-ups   and girls can do sit-ups  . But there are some don'ts here: First, stay away from weight lifting  . It's bad for you, because it gives too much stress   to your body and you can't grow tall if you practise often. You should exercise for about an hour a day, and three days a week. On the other days, don't exercise too much. Exercising too much is not a good idea. Don't go running for a long time. Running for a long time makes you tired. Don't want fastresults  . Your muscles will grow when you get older. If you want to be healthy and strong, exercise and healthy food are the best way. But don't think you can make it in one day. What's the best title   for the article?
----------
  A: Exercise Is Interesting
  B: Be Careful With Exercise
  C: Let's Do Exercise
  D: Bad Exercise

Question 328/400:
An American educational expert, Frederick M. Hess, says that a long summer vacation doesn't make sense in today's world. This summer, 50 million kids will spend much time talking online, watching TV, playing video games and asking older brothers or sisters to take them to the supermarket. They will also be putting their academic futures at risk. During much of the 20th century, many Americans worked in factories that did not need a college degree but still offered a high salary. Also, in the 19th century, there was no air condition. And poor hygiene   meant that crowded schools had health risks. Things have changed. For today's students, academic skills are key to future success. Many countries don't give kids an American-style summer vacation. They offer no more than seven consecutive   weeks of vacation. Most American school districts offer up to 13 weeks. To compete in global marketplace, Americans must be prepared to go up against international competitors. Summer vacation also causes challenges for today's families. In the 1960s, more than 60% of families had a stay-at-home mum. Now, two-thirds of American children live families where every adult works. For these families, summer vacation can be more burden than break. Someone must watch the kids. But the biggest problem may be how summer vacation hurts academic achievement. Scientist have found that disadvantaged students lose important ground in the summertime. A school year can allow time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons. Schools would have more time for sports, languages, music and the arts. How many reasons did the writer give to support his/her opinion?

  A: One.
  B: Two.
  C: Three.

Question 334/400:
Recently, a study showed that changes found in astronauts' eye tissue might cause vision problems, and possibly even blindness. As well as threatening the health of astronauts, this could influence long-distance missions into space. Larry Kramer of Texas Medical School in Houston and his colleagues carried out MRI scans on 27 NASA astronauts after they had spent an average of 108 days in space. About half of them had some problems in their optic nerve   or eyeball. The changes match those seen in people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, a rare condition in which the pressure of blood is abnormally high in the brain. People with the condition experience headaches, nausea   and vision problems including blindness. In space, the changes are probably caused by living in free fall. "It is not because of the sunlight in space or the spacecraft's function," says Kramer. "One likely reason is that blood which normally pools in the legs is shifted toward the skull  , raising pressure."  The findings are similar to the results of a survey of 300 astronauts carried out in 2011. The damage in vision was reported by 29 percent of astronauts on short-term missions, and 60 percent on long-term missions. "If astronauts are exhibiting these changes after only 100 days in space, what will happen on a three-year flight to Mars?" asks Jason Kring, who studies human performance in extreme conditions at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. "Deteriorating vision could seriously damage astronauts' ability to carry out routine mission tasks, including monitoring displays and navigating the rocky landscape of Mars," says Kring. "This possibility, combined with what we already know about how micro-gravity affects muscles and bones, paints a dark future for human space flight unless we start to develop effective measures." Kramer says that NASA has the matter in hand. In the wake of the study, all astronauts now have regular brain scans. This includes those yet to travel into space, providing a baseline   from which any changes would be obvious. He also believes it might be possible to identify astronauts' risk of eyesight damage from medical data before sending them into space. What is the main idea of the passage?
----------
  A: Space flight may be bad for astronauts' eyes.
  B: Scientists are doing research on astronauts' eyes.
  C: Some scientific problems exist in astronauts' eyes.
  D: Measures should be taken to protect astronauts' eyes.

Question 336/400:
Treasure Island isn't a true story,  _  armed to the teeth and ready to go treasure hunting. But you will find, as you read this book, that although pirates can be murderous and treacherous ,they can also be cowardly, superstitious, and easily led. As it turns out, that is fortunate for Jim Hawkins.     It's a brilliant story. Billy Bones, a retired seaman, comes to live at the Admiral Benbow inn. Jim is just a boy, but he can see that Billy Bones is a nervous man, always on the look-out for strangers arriving at the inn. And well he might be nervous, because he carries with him in his battered old sea-chest a map drawn by Captain Flint himself giving the whereabouts of all Flint's buried treasure! Captain Flint! -the most feared pirate ever to travel the high seas.     Well,Flint is dead, but there are plenty of men who served with Captain Flint still alive who will feel they have a fair claim to the treasure. The map, though, ends up in the possession of Jim Hawkins---(it's a near thing, read the book to see how that happens)     Jim tells the secret in the local doctor, who quickly joins forces to acquire a ship and crew to sail for Treasure Island     There's a famous scene where Jim, hiding in the apple barrel on deck, discovers that mutiny is planned. It's a bad moment. The numbers suggest that the pirates are going to have it all their own way. There are nineteen mutineers and seven honest men, including Jim.     And now, you will have to read the book for yourself. This is a fantastic tale of cheat, bravery and cowardice. I don't know how things would have turned out if it hadn't been for Jim Hawkins. For it is Jim who single-handedly steals the Hispaniola from under the very noses of the pirates and sails her round the island to a secret beaching place.     And do you know what happens to Long John Silver, the greatest double-crosser of them all? No? Well, don't expect me to tell you. Don't be nervous of reading a 'classic'. I know it was published a long time ago, but that doesn't mean it is difficult to read. There is one piece of advice I will give, though. I don't think this book is ever out of print---there are hundreds of different copies around. If you can, choose a copy with large enough print to be able to read comfortably, and exciting illustrations. It makes all the difference.     Go ahead! Read the book. I think you'll love it.

Question 338/400:
The weather was terrible that night.The summer thunderstorm had knocked out the power.Luckily,there was enough candlelight flickering on the kitchen table.With the  candlelight,I could see the card I was writing to my husband's cousins in Finland. Dear Heli and Risto, You are on my mind tonight because we are using the candles you gave us when you visited us two years ago.There was a horrible summer thunderstorm this evening and the power went out,and your candles were just what we needed.They have lit our dinnertime,the bedrooms and now I am sitting by one in the kitchen... What I didn't say to Heli and Risto is that we never burned the candles before because they,well,smell like a campfire.And so they stood in iron candlesticks until we needed them. I'm so thankful that we had candles on hand that dark night.And I'm equally as thankful that I had a beautiful card on hand,too,or I would have let the opportunity to keep in touch with faraway family escape.It would have turned into another one of those moments when the thought of sending a card crossed my mind but never actually happened. The candle burned slowly.After I finished my card to Finland,I enjoyed looking through the rest of my "Someone Cares" greeting cards.The air was fresh and cool,and I had cards and enough light to write.I found a birthday card for my nephew's 10th birthday,a thinkingofyou card for my aunt,and a fun greeting card for an old friend and I began writing.Candles and cards--two things that make a thunderstorm into the perfect storm. Why did the writer light the two candles that night?
----------
  A: Because she thought of her husband's cousins.
  B: Because she wanted to add some fun to her life.
  C: Because she wanted to enjoy another kind of lifestyle.
  D: Because there was no electricity due to the thunderstorm.

Question 339/400:
While reading a story on 20-somethings complaining about how the economy is ruining their life plans, I couldn't help but think the 20-somethings sound like a bunch of spoiled children who grow up expecting everything to be easy for them. As a 20-something myself, I certainly share their disappointment -my husband and I probably won't be able to buy a house until we're in our forties, and we two are burdened by student loans. But why should it be different? Being young people in America, shouldn't they take up all of the challenges and opportunities that this country offers? Consider some of these views shared in the story: Jennifer, 29, owner of a two-bedroom apartment with her husband, worries that she won't be able to have children for at least a decade because they can't afford to buy a house yet. I read that, and I thought what planet she is living on where you need to own a house in order to have kids? Has she ever visited a developing country, or even downtown areas in this one? Home ownership is a luxury, not a fertility requirement. A 26-year-old man in the story is disappointed that he can't afford to get a Ph. D. in literature. Well, that sounds a bit like expressing disappointment that no one will pay you to write poetry on the beach in Thailand for five years. Yes, it's sad that these young people feel so lost. But I think the problem is their extremely high expectations, not economic reality. Beth Kobliner, author of Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties, says that she thinks people's expectations grow up when their wealth appears to be increasing. Their parents probably see their home values rise along with their investments. "So we have people who have grown up in an environment where people have great expectations of what living well means," says Kobliner. This recession will certainly play a role in forcing those expectations into more realistic group. In the meantime, it seems much better for our mental health to focus on being grateful--for our one-bedroom apartments, for living in modern cities, or perhaps just for being able to eat three meals a day--than on longing for some kind of luxurious life. Which of the following is NOT one of the complaints of the 20-somethings?
----------
  A: They can't have children for at least a decade for they can't afford to buy a house.
  B: They have only a one-bedroom apartment to live in.
  C: They can't buy a house until 40 and are burdened by student loans.
  D: in literature.

Question 341/400:
The Beets were a new couple  . The things in their rooms, such as the television, the computer, the fridge, furniture and so on, were all left by their parents. They only paid some money for their food and clothes. But they tried their best to save money. If they had something important to tell their friends, they always visited them instead of calling them. One day, it was a quarter past nine. Mr. Beet didn't come back. His wife was a little worried. The supper was cold and she had waited for two hours. She was sitting by the table in the dark room. Suddenly the woman heard someone coming upstairs. It was her husband's step. She hurried to open the door. In the dark she could hear his deep breathing . As soon as he sat down, she turned on the light and found he looked very tired. "Why do you come back so late, dear?" asked the woman. "Haven't you caught a bus?" "Yes, but I didn't take it." "Why not?" "I ran after it so that I saved two dollars this evening." "That's great!" the woman said happily. "Run after a taxi next time and you'll save both more time and money." Mrs. Beet hoped  _  .

Question 342/400:
For high school leavers starting out in the working world, it is very important to learn particular skills and practice how to behave in an interview or how to find an internship  . In some countries, schools have programs to help students onto the path to work. In the   United States, however, such programs are still few and far behind. Research shows that if high schools provide career-related courses, students are likely to get higher earnings in later years. The students are more likely to stay in school, graduate and go on to higher education. In Germany, students as young as 13 and 14 are expected to do internships. German companies work with schools to make sure that young people get the education they need for future employment. But in America, education reform programs focus on how well students do in exams instead of bringing them into contact with the working world. Harvard Education school professor Robert Schwartz has criticized education reformers for trying to place all graduates directly on the four-year college track. Schwartz argued that this approach leaves the country's most vulnerable kids with no jobs and no skills. Schwartz believed that the best career programs encourage kids to go for higher education while also teach them valuable practical skills at high school. James Madison High School in New York, for example ,encourages students to choose classes on career-based courses. The school then helps them gain on-the-job experience in those fields while they're still at high school. However, even for teens whose schools encourage them to connect with work, the job market is _ . In the US, unemployment rates for 16-to-19-year-olds are above 20 percent for the third summer in a row. "The risk is that if teenagers miss out on the summer job experience, they will become part of this generation of teens who had trouble in landing a job," said Michael, a researcher in the US. In the author's opinion, German high school leavers   _  .
----------
  A: enjoy more career-related courses than that of US
  B: need more career advice from their schools
  C: perform better in exams than American students
  D: are less brought into contact with the working world

Question 343/400:
As I was leaving to meet Lynne, my roommate told me that I'd better take some money. But I didn't listen to him. I thought that Lynne would pay because she had invited me. I arrived at the restaurant exactly on time. I'd been told that Americans expect you to be on time. Lynne and I sat at a table in the corner of restaurant and a waitress came and took our order. The dinner was a great success. I talked a lot about Saudi Arabia and Lynne told me all about herself. After two hours, the waitress finally came and asked if we wanted one check or two. Lynne said two. We went to the cashier and Lynne paid her check. I was embarrassed   when the cashier gave me my bill. I had no money to pay for my meal. Then I had an idea. I pretended to look for something in my pockets and said, "Oh! I forgot my wallet! Can I call my roommate, please?" The cashier showed me where the phone was and I quickly called my roommate. In a few minutes, he arrived with some money, but he couldn't hide how he felt. He laughed all the way home. Now, I think it's funny too, but at that time I was terribly embarrassed. I thought that an invitation to have dinner in the United States meant the same thing as that in China. I guess you have to understand that your customs are only your customs. When you visit a foreign country, you have to learn about their customs, too. The roommate laughed all the way home because   _  .

  A: the writer was embarrassed when he couldn't pay his check

Question 344/400:
Bedazzling   with their bright colors and eye-catching displays, fireworks light up our night skies during the holidays. However, these crowd-pleasers can have some damaging side effects. Once a firework is set off, it only takes a couple of seconds before smoke, dust and harmful chemicals are let out into the atmosphere. The loud booming noises are caused by gunpowder. While the sounds may excite some people, they can be frightening to domestic and wild animals--as well as some humans. The pretty colors you see are a result of more chemicals. Barium, added to make green, is known for its poisonous and radioactive qualities. Blue comes from copper compounds. Cadmium, lithium and lead--all found in fireworks--have been linked to diseases, such as allergies and skin rashes in both humans and animals. Acid rain has been linked to gases given off by fireworks, which sometimes go beyond the toxin  limits of the United States Clean Air Act. Once all those chemicals come back down to the ground, they can cause problems too. Debris   from the fireworks falls to the ground, where animals can burn their paws or noses on piping hot pieces. Humans also are at risk of stepping on or picking up something sharp or hot. Meanwhile, debris that finds its way into waterways can damage animal habitats and water supply sources. Instead of setting off fireworks, try to come up with some new ways for fun. Here are some ideas to get you started: * Sky lanterns--a tradition that originated long ago in the most-populated Asian country. * Party crackers--a favorite in the United Kingdom--give you noise and surprises without the mess of fireworks. You can make your own or buy eco-friendly crackers. * Want noise excitement with less volume? Consider a fireworks sound recording beforehand or break out the party horns   and blow up a storm! What can be concluded as the writer's attitude towards fireworks?
----------
  A: It is not allowed to set off fireworks except during the holidays.
  B: Fireworks should be banned and replaced by some other means.
  C: Night is the best time to set off fireworks and see the pretty colors.
  D: You cannot set off fireworks unless you come up with new ways.

Question 345/400:
In classes, your teachers will talk about topics that you are studying. The information they provide will be important for you to know when you take tests. You must be able to take good written notes from what your teachers say. Taking good notes has three stages. There are certain things you should do before class, during class, and after class. Here are the three stages of note-taking and what you should do during each class. 1. Get Ready to Take Notes Review your notes from the previous  class before you come to class. This will help you remember what was covered and get you ready to understand the new information your teacher will provide. Complete all assigned  readings before you come to class. Your teacher will expect that  you have done this and will use and build upon this information. Bring all note-taking materials with you to class - several pens and pencils as well as your notebook. 2. Take Notes Keep your attention on what your teacher is saying. Paying attention to "signal statements". Examples of signal statements are "The most important point ..." and "Remember that ..," Be sure to include in your notes information that your teacher repeats or written on the blackboard. Write quickly so that you can include all the important information in your notes. Do this by writing abbreviated   words such as med for medicine, using symbols such as % for percent, and writing short sentences. Place a "?" next to information about whose meaning you are not sure. What will most probably be talked about next?
----------
  A: How to prepare for exams.
  B: An easy way to take notes.
  C: Note-taking after class.
  D: The importance of taking notes.

Question 347/400:
One of the best things you can do for your health is to drop a few pounds. Or maybe morethan a few pounds.  Being overweight increases your danger of heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer,,the list seems almost endless. You'd better find several simple things you can do on a daily basis  such as making rules of eating more vegetables and less fat and getting more physical activities.  After breakfast, make water your primary drink. At breakfast, go ahead and drink orange juice. But throughout the rest of the day, focus on water instead of juice or soda. The average American consumes  an extra 245 calories a day from soft drinks. That's nearly 90,000 calories a year -- or 25 pounds! And research shows that neither the calories nor sugary drinks give you a sense of fullness the way that food does.  People take only 2,000 to 3, 000 steps a day. Adding 2,000 steps will help you keep your present weight and stop gaining weight. Adding more than that will help you lose weight.  Eat five or six small meals or snacks a day instead of three large meals. A 1999 South African study found that when men ate parts of their morning meal at intervals over five hours, they consumed almost 20 percent fewer calories at lunch than when they ate a single breakfast.

Question 349/400:
Once there was a man who lied to eat mangoes. One day he decided to get the sweetest mango from the very top of the tree. Mangoes which are exposed to the sun the most are the sweetest. So he climbed up to the top, where the branches were thin. He managed to pick up a few sweet reddish fruits, but, in an attempt to climb down, he slipped and started falling towards the ground. Fortunately, he caught the branch as he was falling and remained helplessly hanging on the tree. Then he started to call nearby villagers for help. They immediately came with a ladder and sticks, but could do little to help him. Then after some time one calm and thoughtful person arrived - a well-known sage who lived in a simple hut nearby. People were very curious to see what he would do, as he was famous in solving many people's problems in the area and sometimes very complicated ones. He was silent for a minute and then picked up a stone and threw it at the hanging man. Everybody was surprised. The hanging mango lover started to shout: What are you doing?! Are you crazy? Do you want me to break my neck?"  The sage was silent. Then he took another stone and threw it at the man. The man was very angry: "If I could just come down, I would show you!" That's what everybody wanted - that he came down. But how? Now everybody was tense, as to what would happen next! Some wanted to chastise the sage, but they didn't. The sage picked another stone and threw it again at the man, even more forcefully. Now the man on the tree was enraged and developed a great determination to come down and take revenge.  He then used all his skill and strength and somehow reached the branches which were safe to start going down. And he made it! Everybody was amazed. However, the rescued man found the sage gone. He stood there, realizing that the man really sed him because he induced him to try his best and save himself. "I should be thankful and not angry." What does the story imply?
----------
  A: Anger saves one's life.
  B: Wisdom does count.
  C: Skill and strength count.
  D: Anger is the biggest enemy.

Question 350/400:
Vegetable gardening is the relaxing art and science of turning a love for growing plants into a worthwhile activity. Vegetable gardeners agree that many home-grown vegetables picked at their best are superior to those vegetables purchased from markets. From spring through late fall, a well-planned and well-kept garden can prove a supply of fresh vegetables, thus increasing the nutrition of the family diet. Freezers make it possible to keep some of the vegetables to be enjoyed at a later date. Other vegetables can be stored for a few months in a cool area. Having vegetables in the backyard makes home gardening appealing  for many people. In addition, vegetable gardening provides exercise and fun for both urban and suburban families. Although the money spent for a garden may be little, one cannot escape the fact that gardening requires hard work and time. Many of the gardening tasks must be performed at times that are most inconvenient. Not doing jobs that should be done on a regular basis may result in failure and a negative feeling toward gardening. One should not plant a garden that is too large for him to care for. A small, well-kept garden is more enjoyable and profitable than a large neglected one. Vegetables do well in full sunlight and need at least five or six hours of sun during the middle of the day. Too much shading results in poor plants and few vegetables. If possible, the garden should be near the house so the gardener can work in it at odd moments. Soils for vegetables should be easily broken up and porous  for quick water drainage and good aeration . A deep, fine, sandy good quality soil is best. Usually the hoe owner has little choice in the soil type he can choose. Fortunately, many vegetables can be grown on poor soils if the soils are properly prepared. The author suggests that an ideal vegetable garden    _   .
----------
  A: should be sunny
  B: should be within walking distance
  C: should be large-sized
  D: should consist of sandy soil

Question 352/400:
With a wildlife guide, I stepped on a journey to find one of the rarest creatures in the world ----the spirit bear, a walking contradiction--a white black bear. Neither albino   nor polar bear, the spirit bear is a white variant   of the North American black bear, and it's found almost exclusively here in the Great Bear Rainforest. At 25,000 square miles ---- one and a half times as big as Switzerland--the region is a spooky , wild, mysterious place: there are wolves here that fish. Deer that swim. Western red cedar trees that have stood a thousand years. And a black bear that is white. Scientists know how black bears are born white. They're just not sure why. The phenomenon, known as Kermodism, is caused by a recessive mutation   at the MC1R gene, the same gene associated with red hair and fair skin in humans. To be born white, a bear must inherit the mutation from both parents. The parents themselves don't have to be white. They just need to carry the recessive mutation. So it's not uncommon for white bears to be born to black parents. White fur happens in only one of every 40 to 100 black bears on the British Columbia mainland coast, but the feature is especially distinct on certain islands in the Great Bear Rainforest. For example, on Princess Royal Island, one in ten black bears is white, and on Gribbell Island, directly north of Princess Royal, it's one in three. It's unclear how the feature arose. One theory was the "glacial bear" hypothesis   that the spirit bear represented a remaining adaptation from the last great ice age, which ended here 11,000 years ago. At that time most of modern-day British Columbia was still icebound, and a white coat may have offered camouflage  . But the "glacial bear" theory raised a question: Why didn't the white fur feature die out when the glaciers  _ ? Researchers have recently proved that the spirit bear's white coat gives it an advantage when fishing. Although white and black bears tend to have the same success rate after dark, there is a difference during the daytime. White bears catch salmon in one-third of their attempts. Black individuals are successful only one-quarter of the time. "The salmon are less concerned about a white object as seen from below the surface," a scientist guesses. That may answer part of the question about why the white-fur feature continues to flourish today. If salmon are a coastal bear's primary fat and protein source, a successful female can feast on salmon to store more fat for winter, potentially increasing the number of cubs she can produce. It is most likely that white fur happens   _  .

Question 353/400:
Any diet on which you eat fewer calories than you need to get through the day -- like an 800-calorie-per-day diet can be dangerous. Diets that don't allow any fat also can be bad for you. Everyone needs a certain amount of fat in their diet -- up to 30% of total calories -- so no one should eat a completely fat-free diet. Don't have diets that restrict  certain food groups, either. A diet that requires you to say no to bread or pasta or allows you to eat only fruit is unhealthy. You won't get the vitamins and minerals you need. And although you may lose weight, you'll probably gain it back as soon as you start eating normally again. Some people start dieting because they think all the problems in their lives are because of weight. Others have an area of their lives that they can't control, like an alcoholic parent, so they focus on something they can control -- their exercise and food intake. People who diet may get lots of praise from friends and family when they start losing pounds, which makes them feel good. But eventually a person reaches a weight level -- and doesn't lose as much weight as before because the body is trying to keep a healthy weight, so they aren't any happier. Some people may find it hard to control their eating, so they stick with  _ for a little while, but then eat tons of food. Feeling guilty about the binge, they use laxatives . Eating too little to maintain a healthy weight or eating only to throw up the calories are both eating disorders, which are harmful to a person's health. Which is not the result of restricting certain food groups?
----------
  A: lose weight for a short period
  B: unhealthy
  C: short of nutrition
  D: hungry

Question 354/400:
Young women who take part in beauty contests   are helping to keep alive an outdated opinion of women that a woman's most important value is how she looks. Women have been working very hard through the years to change their image. They have been trying to prove that the value of a woman does not lie only in her beauty. The world is just beginning to recognize that women are as smart, wise and strong in personality as men are, and that there are qualities more important than looks when judging people. When women take part in beauty contests for top prizes, they encourage people to value them for their beauty alone. It is unfair to say that beauty alone determines one's worth. Beauty contests not only encourage spectators   to judge women by their appearance, but they encourage this idea in the contestants as well. These young women spend months losing weight to be the "right" size and learning how to dress, wear makeup, and walk just right so that some judges will consider them beautiful. I think it's great for a woman to feel good about her appearance, but looks shouldn't be sought after in an extreme or unreasonable way. There are too many other, more important, things in a young woman's life: learning, developing friendships and preparing for their future work and perhaps a family. As long as there are beauty contests, women won't be fully recognized as well-rounded human beings. What can we infer from the text?
----------
  A: Looks determine everything.
  B: Wisdom carries much weight.
  C: Spectators should have their voices heard.
  D: Qualities other than looks are more important.

Question 355/400:
A failed plot to kill Barack Obama, uncovered by US federal agents recently, has reminded people of the ideas that some humans associate with simple numbers.     Two white American Neo-Nazi racists   had planned to kill 88 African Americans, before finally assassinating   Obama. The number "88" is equated with "HH", initials   for the Nazi greeting, "Heil Hitler". "H" is the eighth letter of the alphabet . Many people were not familiar with the Neo-Nazi importance of 88, but associations attached to other numbers are more well-known, if not always believed. The number 13, for instance, is considered deeply unlucky.     In the US, many buildings do not have a floor numbered 13. They instead label it 12A, or use the letter M, which is the 13th letter in the English alphabet. New York's John F. Kennedy International airport does not have a gate number 13. And the popular Irish flight carrier, Ryan Air, has banished   row 13 from all its planes.     Last year when Brussels Airline put 13 dots in their new logo, the flood of complaints was so vast the airline was forced to change their "unlucky logo" and add an additional dot.     The fear comes from a Bible story, which states that Judas Iscariot, the disciple   who betrayed   Jesus, was the 13th to sit at the table in the Last Supper.     But the most fascinating fear of the number relates to Friday the 13th. It's a day of double bad luck. In the US, many people would not schedule a wedding for Friday the 13th. According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in the US, an estimated 17 to 21 million Americans are affected by a fear of this day. From the passage, we can know that the Brussels Airline_.
----------
  A: doesn't have row 13
  B: has 14 dots on its logo
  C: has no flight take off on Fridays

Question 357/400:
Never argue with one's own understanding. The whisper of intelligence is always there, whatever you do. If you create a time lag   between the whisper of intelligence and understanding in you and your action, then you are preventing the brain from growing into a new size. When you argue with intelligence, when you postpone acting according to understanding then there is confusion, the brain gets confused. The voice of understanding, the voice of intelligence has insecurity about it. How do you know that it is the right thing? So we tend to ignore it. Instead we accept authority. We obey. But the brain cannot be orderly, competent, accurate and precise if you do not listen to it, if you have no respect. We are so busy with the outside world and its force that the world that is inside us does not command that respect and reverence  , that care and concern from us. So one has to be a disciple   of one's own understanding, and look upon that understanding as the master. Sometimes one may commit a mistake, it might be the whim   of the ego and we might mistake the whim, the wish of the ego for the voice of silence and intelligence, but that we have to discover. Unless you commit mistakes, how do you learn to discriminate between the false and the true? In learning there is bound to be a little insecurity, a possibility of committing mistakes. Why should one be terribly afraid of committing mistakes? So instead of accepting the authority of habits and conditionings, while one is moving one watches, and when there is a suggestion, do not neglect, ignore, or insult the whisper from within and from one's own intelligence. The whole passage is developed by   _  .

Question 359/400:
When Harvard was founded in 1636, there were no other colleges in the American colonies, and it would become the model for many of those that followed. When it began requiring applicants to take a test known as the SAT in 1935, Harvard started another trend. Two years ago, after it announced an aggressive new financial-aid policy, it helped push social class to the center of the national debate over higher education and forced two of its main competitors, Stanford and Yale, to follow its lead. Last week. Harvard began to make another effort to affect higher education in its image, its president, Derek Bok, announced that the college would abandon its early admissions program, which for decades has allowed high school seniors to apply in October and get an answer yes, no or maybe - in December, shortly before the regular deadline for applications. Harvard officials argue that the program is beneficial to rich students who don't need to compare financial-aid offers from various colleges. After the announcement, many people within education urged other colleges to take a similar step. "We're thrilled," said Laurie Kobick, a college counselor   at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va. "I think it's going to make admissions better in so many different ways. It will indeed go a small way toward leveling the field among applicants. Of course, it will also have an effect on colleges, and the biggest winner will almost certainly be Harvard. a fact that may prevent many other colleges - perhaps all of them - from       following Hazard this time. Because any college that does so will risk losing some of its best applicants." By abandoning early admissions program, Harvard wants   _  .

Question 360/400:
Some students who took the International English Language Testing System(IELTS) exam in August and September, 2015 have had their results"withheld  permanently", sending a strong signal that the examiners intend to stamp out cheating, some senior language tutors said. Yang Yuting, chief language training tutor at Amber Education, an overseas education consulting agency, said there have been a few cases in which candidates' IELTS results were canceled in recent years, leaving the students with no qualification but this is the first time he has heard that results, including those of some of his students, were"withheld permanently", meaning IELTS will not give the students their results, nor will they give them to others. Wang Xin, a senior student at the Communication University of China in Beijing, took an IELTS test on August 1 and the results were due within 10 working days. But she was then informed that her results were undergoing routine checks. Soon after that, she received an e-mail telling her that"a decision has been made to withhold this result permanently"and stating that Wang had"breached  IELTS test rules and regulations". A number of students who took the test during the past two months in cities including Nanjing, Changsha and Guangzhou, have had the same experience. Many test takers said they were confused because they didn't know how they had breached the rules and regulations. IELTS authorities said in an e-mail toChinaDailythat IELTS takes the responsibility of providing test results very seriously. Results are only withheld in cases where there is strong evidence to suggest that the candidates have not observed IELTS regulations."In these cases, we are unable to guarantee that their result is a true reflection of their English language skills,"they said in the e-mail, although they gave no figures of how many students were involved."We regret any inconvenience this may cause, but these measures are essential to protect the value of the results for more than 2.5 million test takers every year. Hundreds of thousands of people take IELTS in China every year and the number of results which are permanently withheld is a tiny proportion ,"they said. Hu Min, president ofNew Channel International Education Group, an English-language tutorial agency in China, said a major cause of results being withheld might be an extreme imbalance in performance levels in the four sections of the test."For example, if a student scores very high in the reading and listening sections while performing poorly in writing and speaking, IELTS authorities may suspect that the test taker has memorized the reading and listening questions -- a practice that is very popular among Chinese test takers,"he said."IELTS authorities discourage such a practice and would determine that the scores can't reflect the real English level if test takers do so." Students whose results were withheld were   .

Fans from all overprefix = st1 /Chinawatch their handheld TVs when a competition comes on. Last time I took part in the 78thOlympics on a flying island aboveBrusselsin the sky. I won the silver medal for my performance. This year I had the honour to be chosen again. I wanted to meet robots from other countries and explore ideas about sport. However, my programmer fell ill the week before we were going to leave. It was very painful for her and I felt very frightened. I no longer felt so confident that I would win. The day of the competition was rather cold for my legs and my special oil began to freeze. I paused before I jumped from the starting place on a little spaceship but then I began my performance. At the correct moment I tried to open my parachute but there was a problem. It only opened a little. Instead of flying softly to earth I began to fall faster and faster so that I could not turn, dive, circle or dance. My heart stopped beating as I landed heavily on a mountain covered with snow. This is why I am writing to you from my hospital bed with two broken legs and a fragile   head. I did not win anything at the Olympics after all. I need the factory to build me two new legs and an even bigger head. Then I will be able to compete once more. Let's hope for greater success in the next Olympics! The reason why Hua Fei failed to perform well this year is that_.
----------
  A: he didn't do it in the right way
  B: he couldn't open his parachute
  C: he didn't replace the batteries
  D: he was affected by a wrong programme

Question 364/400:
There are many fun, free activities that you can do as a family. All that is required is a bit of imagination and some time set aside for fun. And the best part is that these are the kind of memories a child will remember for a lifetime. Family game night Find out any of the games that are already around the house. Kids often get computer games for Christmas or birthdays, and would love to have a chance to play with their family. Or, make up some games of your own. " _ " is a fun game to play that will challenge a child to use his/her imagination. Divide the family into teams and let each team come up with words that the other has to act out.  _  Pick some time for the family to sit down and come up with their own masterpiece. It doesn't need to be just a drawing -- take some old magazines sitting around the house, let the kids cut out pictures and paste them into their own montage. Or, use items from nature. Let them use leaves, pine cones, twigs and whatever else they can find to create something from their imaginations. Family Picnic Taking the family for a picnic is a great way for some fun that doesn't cost any money. If the weather is nice, take them to a park or playground and let the kids have a day of playing. Or, if it is the middle of winter and a foot of snow is on the ground, set up a picnic in the living room. Family Field Trip A family field trip doesn't have to cost a dime. Ask a nearby farm if it would be alright to bring your kids out for a tour and to see some of the animals. Or take them to a park and make a scavenger hunt where they need to find certain items from nature. Ask a local business if you could bring the family for a tour to see how things work -- you might be surprised at the number of people who would be thrilled to share what they do with others, and it could be an interesting lesson for the kids. We can learn from the passage that "charades"   _  .
----------
  A: is a computer game
  B: is too difficult for children
  C: involves acting out words
  D: should be played by more than four people

Question 366/400:
Lots of kids hate school, a new study found. Usually this kind of feeling doesn't last long. But what happens if you feel this way too much? School is a fact of life and getting a good education can help you build the kind of future life you want. So let's talk about school and what to do when you don't like it.     If you don't like school, the first step is to find out why. You might not like school because you don't have enough friends, or maybe you don't get along with your teacher. Sometimes it's a big problem with your classes and school-work. You may be getting farther and farther behind, and it may seem like you'll never catch up.    When you know why you don't like school, you can start taking steps to make things better. It's a good idea to talk to someone about your problems with school. Your mum, dad, teacher or school counselor  will be able to help you. Another good idea is to write down your feelings about school in a notebook. It's a great way to let out emotions .

Question 367/400:
The New Folk Sound Of Terry Collier attracted little interest when first released   , and by the time it was championed on a music chart, Callier had long abandoned music for a career in computer programming.As a result, he returned to music to make many recordings with some leading young artists in Britain, making it the most successful period of his life. Terry Callier was born into a poor family on May 24, 1945 and grew up in Chicago.He learned to practice the piano and began singing in groups in his teens.He released his first single, Look At Me Now in 1962.When offered a tour, he seemed to be a shining star soon.But then his mother stepped in, insisting that, at 17 , his place was not on the road but at home studying. While attending college, he began performing in folk clubs and coffee houses.It was also when he started his songwriting.Callier continued to record and give live concerts through the 1970s touring with some famous popular singers.His combination of fierce guitar, wise lyrics  and sweet voices created a distinctive style known as jazz-folk.However, he had more success as a songwriter than as a singer when he sang his hit song The Love We Had Stays on My Mind in 1971. In 1983 he abandoned music completely to attend his 12-year-old daughter after splitting up with his wife.He got a steady job at the University of Chicago and did not touch a guitar for years.Many years later, some DJs discovered his old recordings and began to play his songs in clubs.Though Callier was unwilling to get involved in music again, Callier was eventually persuaded to come back, which brought him more applauses than he had ever experienced.

Question 368/400:
Few of us haven't read Cinderella , the story of a young woman living in poverty who meets the prince of her dreams. Some might not want to admit it, but there is a hidden Cinderella in everyone's heart--we all wish we could achieve recognition or success after a period of obscurity . Mary Santiago has that secret dream, too. Her story is featured  in Another Cinderella Story, a film set in a US high school. Mary is shy but loves to dance. Compared with other girls, she is invisible. However, her world changes completely when a famous teenager pop singer, Joey Parker, appears. Joey is everything the rest of the boys in her class are not--kind, handsome and desirable. Mary and Joey's paths cross at a ball. They meet and fall in love with each other. But when Mary has to rush back home, she leaves behind her MP3 player, which becomes the only clue Joey has to find the girl of his dreams. Of course, there is a wicked  stepmother, who turns out to be Dominique Blatt and she takes in Mary after her dancer mother dies. Dominique treats Mary like a maid and does everything she can to make sure Mary doesn't get into the top dance school. Her two daughters are equally determined to stop Joey falling for Mary, even if that means embarrassing her. The story, though it mostly follows Cinderella, does add a few modern day twists to the classic fairy tale. Refreshingly, the film, unlike many high school films, does not focus on looks, although the actors are all beautiful. There is also a lot less materialism in Another Cinderella Story than in many similar movies. "The movie takes the Cinderella fairytale as its jumping off point," writes movie critic Amber Wilkinson, "The focus is firmly on following your dream." The passage is mainly about   _  .
----------
  A: an introduction to a novel
  B: a review about a film
  C: a passage about dreams
  D: an advertisement of Cinderella

Question 370/400:
A recent study shows that young people in the UK aged between 11 and 15 spend, on average,52 hours a week in front of a screen.Dr.Aric Sigman, a researcher from the British Psychological Society,believes watching too much TV can cause health problems for children,including attention deficit disorder and obesity .He said children under three shouldn't watch TV at all. Children aged between three and seven should watch no more than 30 minutes to an hour of TV a day; 7 to 12-year-olds should be limited to an hour,and 12 to 15-year-olds should watch one and a half hours at most. Both adults and children believe that it can be difficult to cut down on screen time."It needs a bit of effort,but small steps can make a difference,"says Dr. Aric Sigman.He also offered some tips to change the family's TV habits. TVs and computers should be placed out of children's bedrooms.Watching TV before going to sleep doesn't help children to settle  . Having the TV and computer in a family room also means that parents can know what they are watching and who they are talking to online.Parents can tell children how much time they can spend watching TV or playing computer games.Parents can tell children to do something different,such as playing games or going out for a bike ride.Dr. Aric Sigman says:"We went into lots of schools and the children told us they wished their parents would take them to the park and play with them." According to Dr.Aric Sigman,  _   .
----------
  A: children's screen time should be limited
  B: most childhood obesity problems are caused by bad TV watching habits

Question 373/400:
FOR people who are interested in space, nothing is more exciting than the idea of living on other planets. That might be why the movie The Martian (<<>> ) is so popular. It shows an astronaut struggling to live on Mars. But would it actually be possible to live on the Red Planet? While the idea of living on Mars is great, the reality does not look as good. Mars does not have a friendly atmosphere for humans. There is very little oxygen there. And because of its distance from the sun, it is also very cold. The temperature on Mars can be -62 degrees on average. This is much too cold for humans. However, scientists say it might be possible to live there even without a good atmosphere. Daytime on Mars is almost the same as Earth's. It means there's enough sunlight to grow plants inside safe buildings. However, they would have to grow in soil from Earth. Mars does not have a strong enough atmosphere to stop the radiation coming from space, which makes it dangerous to grow things in the soil. The radiation is also bad for our health. If we want to live there healthily, we need to build our homes under the ground or within the rocks on the planet. This would protect humans from the radiation and also some heat. When could we actually live on Mars? NASA is hoping to make some progress within the next 20 years. Which of the following about Mars is NOT true?
----------
  A: Its atmosphere is not good for humans.
  B: It has very little oxygen.
  C: It's colder than Earth.
  D: It's closer to the sun than Earth is.

Question 374/400:
Packaging is an important form of advertising.A package can sometimes _ someone to buy a product.For example, a small child might ask for a breakfast food that comes in a box with a picture of a TV character.The child is more interested in the picture than in breakfast food.Pictures for children to color or cut out, games printed on a package, or a small gift inside a box also motivate many children to buy products or to ask their parents to buy for them. Some packages suggest that a buyer will get something for nothing.Food products sold in reusable containers are examples of this.Although a similar product in a plain container might cost less, people often prefer to buy the product in a reusable glass or dish, because they believe the container is free.However, the cost of the container is added to the cost of the product.The size of a package also motivates a buyer.Maybe the package had "Economy Size" or "Family Size" printed on it.This suggests that the larger size has the most product for the least money.But that is not always true.To find it out, a buyer has to know how the product is sold and the price of the basic unit. The information on the package should provide some answers.But the important thing for any buyer to remember is that a package is often an advertisement.The words and pictures do not tell the whole story.Only the product inside can do that. What is the best title for the passage?
----------
  A: How to Package a Product.
  B: How to Make an Advertisement.
  C: How to Sell Product.
  D: How to Treat the Package Wisely.

Question 375/400:
Mary Jean Price Walls graduated second in her class in 1950.She had high hopes when she applied to a local college,Southwest Missouri State College.But after sending off her application,she spent months waiting for a reply.It never came. Worse than simply being denied admission ,the school didn't reply to her at all.It wasn't a matter of her school records,but of her skin color:Wallsis African American,and in those days,that fact alone closed a lot of doors. "I was sad and I was hurt,"Walls toldABCNews."I did not expect the skin color would affect my application.I thought I could go to university like other students." Four years later,the government declared that all schools should not discriminate against African Americans-- but it was too late for Walls.She'd moved on with her life, becoming a wife and a mother,and working as an elevator operator.She retired last year,at the age of 77. She stayed quiet about the unfairness she'd faced in Missouri State.Her son,Terry,went through school records and found that she'd been the first black student to ever apply to the college.Today,four percent of the Southwest Missouri State College body is African American--including Terry. Although it's too late for Missouri State to change the past,the school is awarding Walls with an honorary degree from the school.While she knows it's too late for herto change the course of her own life with the degree,it's a chance for her to show her family that Missouri State has changed in the last 60 years,and there's not a single door closed to them anymore. What can we know about Walls's son?
----------
  A: He helped his mother get the honorary degree.
  B: He is a good student who teachers like best.
  C: He was admitted by the college once his mother applied to.
  D: He wants to be a government official who can help his mother.

Question 376/400:
According to new research,there could be a social hierarchy attached to where people stand in the lift.More senior men stand at the back,young men in the middle and women of all ages at the front. Most people know that awkward feeling when you shuffle into an elevator with other people and try not to make eye contact. But new research suggests it may be down to a subconscious power struggle being played out as you make your way up or down. A study found that people decide where they stand based on a micro social hierarchy,established within seconds of entering the lift. Rebekah Rousi,a Ph.D.student in cognitive science,conducted all ethnographic study of elevator behaviour in two of the tallest office buildings in Adelaide,Australia. As part of her research,she took a total of 30 lift rides in the two buildings,and discovered there was an established order to where people tended to stand. In a blog for Ethnography Matters,she writes that more senior men seemed to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins. She said,"In front of them were younger men,and in front of them were women of all ages." She also noticed there was a difference in where people directed their gaze half way through the ride. Men watched the monitors,looked in the side mirrors(in one building)to see themselves,and in the door mirrors(of the other building)to also watch others. Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users(unless in conversation)and the mirrors,she writes. The doctorate student concluded it could be that people who are shyer stand toward the front,where they can't see other passengers,whereas bolder people stand in the back,where they have a view of everyone else. Which of following best summarizes the main idea of the passage?
----------
  A: Women are more attentive than men in the lift.
  B: Both women and men like to watch the monitors in the lift.
  C: The shyer you are,the more likely you are to stand at the back in the lift.
  D: Why where you stand in the lift reflects your social status.

Question 377/400:
There was a time in my life when beauty meant something special to me. I guess that would have been when I was about six or seven years old, just several weeks or maybe a month before the orphanage  turned me into an old man.       I would get up every morning at the orphanage, make my bed just like the little soldier that I had become and then I would get into one of the two straight lines and march to breakfast with the other twenty or thirty boys who also lived in my dormitory.       After breakfast one Saturday morning I returned to the dormitory and saw the house parent chasing the beautiful monarch butterflies who lived by the hundreds in the bushes scattered around the orphanage.       I carefully watched as he caught these beautiful creatures, one after another, and then took them from the net and then stuck straight pins through their head and wings, pinning them onto a heavy cardboard sheet.       How cruel it was to kill something of such beauty. I had walked many times out into the bushes, all by myself, just so the butterflies could land on my head, face and hands so I could look at them up close.       When the telephone rang the house parent laid the large cardboard paper down on the back cement step and went inside to answer the phone. I walked up to the cardboard and looked at the one butterfly who he had just pinned to the large paper. It was still moving about so I reached down and touched it on the wing causing one of the pins to fall out. It started flying around and around trying to get away but it was still pinned by the one wing with the other straight pin. Finally its wing broke off and the butterfly fell to the ground and just trembled.       I picked up the torn wing and the butterfly and I spat on its wing and tried to get it to stick back on so it could fly away and be free before the house parent came back. But it would not stay on him. What is the author's attitude towards the house parent's pinning some butterflies on the cardboard?
----------
  A: tolerant
  B: unconcerned
  C: disgusted
  D: discouraged

Question 379/400:
Air pollution levels were literally off the charts  in Beijing over the weekend, reportedly reducing visibility  to about 100 yards in some areas. The air has been classified hazardous to human health for many days, at its worst hitting pollution levels 25 times that considered safe in the U. S. The entire city is blanketed  in a thick grey smog, leading to official warnings to stay inside. At least four deaths have been blamed on what Chinese media calls the "smoggy weather"--including two high school students who were hit by a train due to low visibility. The smog has affected more than 30 cities in China. The air quality is so bad--some foreigners in China have been referring to it on social media as the "Airpocalypse "--that government media have been joining Internet users in questioning China's rapid path to economic growth. Unusually, the pollution is getting headline treatment on local news bulletins and in the domestic  media. Since the beginning of the year, the government has been releasing hourly pollution readings for 74 Chinese cities, almost half of which are now showing severe pollution. In the Chinese media, there's been some soul-searching  about why the problem has been so serious. The China Daily took the country's rapid urbanization  process to task , commenting in an editorial, "The air quality in big cities could have been better had more attention been paid to the density  of high rises, had more trees been planted in proportion  to the number of residential areas, and had the number of cars been strictly controlled." Meanwhile, the Global Tunes has been pointing out China's role as the global factory and the "biggest construction site in the world." The Los Angeles Times reports fuel, standards in China allow for three times the amount of poisonous sulfur  as in the United States, and five times as much compared to European standards. The passage is mainly dealing with
----------
  A: the smoggy weather in Beijing
  B: the severe air pollution in China

Question 380/400:
Ireland has had a very difficult history. The problems started in the 16thcentury when English rulers fried to conquer  Ireland. For hundreds of years, the Irish people fought against the English. Finally, in 1921. The British government was forced to give independence to the south of Ireland. The result is that today there are two "Irelands". Northern Ireland. In the north, is part of the united kingdom. The republic of Ireland. In the south. Is an independent country. In the 1840s the main crop, potatoes ,was affected by disease and about 750,000 people died of bunger. This, and a shortage   of work , forced many people to leave Ireland and live in the USA, the UK, Australia and Canada. As a result of these problems, the population fell from 8.2 million in 1841 to 6.6 million in 1851. For many years, the majority of Irish people earned their living as farmers. Today, many people still work on the land but more and more people are moving to the cities to work in factories and offices. Life in the cities is very different from life in the countryside, where things move at a quieter and slower pace. The Irish are famous for being warm-hearted and friendly, Oscar Wilde, a famous Irish writer, once said that the Irish were "the greatest talkers since the Greeks", Since independence, Ireland has revived  its own culture of music, language, literature and singing. Different are as have different styles of old Irish song which are sung without instruments. Other kinds of Irish music use many different instruments such as the violin, whistles, etc. we learn from the text that in Ireland  _  .
----------
  A: food shortages in the 1840s led to a decline in population
  B: people are moving to the cities for lack of work in the countryside
  C: it is harder to make a living as a farmer than as a factory worker

Question 381/400:
If two scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory are correct, people will still be driving gasoline powered cars 50 years from now, giving out heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere--and yet that carbon dioxide will not contribute to global warming. In a proposal by two scientists, vehicle emissions   would no longer contribute to global warming. The scientists, F. Jeffrey Martin and William L. Kubic Jr., are proposing a concept, which they have named Green Freedom, for removing carbon dioxide from the air and turning it back into gasoline. The idea is simple. Air would be blown over a liquid solution of potassium carbonate, which would absorb the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide would then be put to chemical reactions that would turn it into fuel : gasoline or jet fuel. This process could change carbon dioxide from an unwanted, climate-changing pollutant into a vast resource for renewable fuels. The cycle--equal amounts of carbon dioxide produced and removed--would mean that cars, trucks and airplanes using the synthetic   fuels would no longer be contributing to global warming. Although they have not yet built a synthetic fuel factory, or even a small model, the scientists say it is all based on existing technology. "Everything in the concept has been built, is operating or has a close cousin that is operating." Dr. Martin said. The Los Alamos proposal does not go against any laws of physics, and other scientists who have independently suggested similar ideas. Dr. Martin said he and Dr. Kubic had worked out their concept in more detail than former proposals. There is, however, a major fact that explains why no one has built a carbon-dioxide-to-gasoline factory: it requires a great deal of energy. According to their analysis, their concept, which would cost about $5 billion to build, could produce gasoline at an operating cost of $1.40 a gallon and would turn economically practical when the price at the pump hits $4.60 a gallon. Other scientists said the Los Alamos proposal perhaps looked promising but could not evaluate it fully because the details has not been published. "It's definitely worth pursuing," said Martin I. Hoffert, a professor of physics at New York University. "It's not that new an idea. It has a couple of pieces to it that are interesting." What is the concept of Green Freedom?
----------
  A: Removing the emission of carbon dioxide.
  B: Reducing the carbon dioxide produced by car driving.
  C: Recycling the carbon dioxide into gasoline.
  D: Reserving the carbon dioxide for global warming.

Question 382/400:
British and American scientists are raising genetically modified  pigs in the hope of providing organs for transplant  to humans, the project leader wrote in a newspaper Sunday.  Scientists in London and California have begun conducting the genetic experiments to find a solution to record-long waiting lists for organ transplants, Robert Winston said in an opinion piece written for Britain's Sunday Times.  In Britain alone, around 8,000 patients are waiting for a transplant.  "People needing a new heart or liver are waiting for someone else to die -usually a violent death in a traffic accident," Winston wrote in the newspaper. He said his team was "trying to modify pigs so their organs might save the lives of humans."  The scientists are introducing human genes into the animals to reduce the chances of the organs being rejected by patients, as has been common in previous attempts to use animal tissues, said Winston, who heads the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology at London's Hammersmith Hospital.  Working with Dr. Carol Redhead of the California Institute of Technology, Winston's team has injected human genes directly into male piglets , adding them to the animal's sperm .  He said that pigs involved in experiments had successfully produced transgenic sperm, but acknowledged that British and European laws had prevented the team from using the pigs to mate.  The Sunday Times newspaper reported that the experiments would be moved to the United States following difficulties with funding and regulations in Britain. It said the pigs would be bred in Missouri.  "Our U.S. friends will benefit from our technology and the income we might have produced for Britain will be lost," Winston wrote.  Some scientists have previously blamed the idea of using animal organs for human transplant, saying the technique risks spreading animal viruses to humans. Winston said his research project is attempting to breed virus-free pigs. Some scientists have blamed the idea of using animal organs for human transplant because   _  .

Question 383/400:
When my father was getting ready for work, our house was ruled by knocks and words. He used to come downstairs to breakfast. The morning paper lay beside his plate. He always read the "Deaths" first, and then he knocked once on the table. One of my sisters brought his toast ,already buttered for him. Usually he said nothing, but once I heard him say, "I love you very much, Edith. I would love you more if you buttered my toast on both sides." He read the paper all through breakfast. Two knocks on the table meant "I am ready for my tea." If a single knock followed, that meant "More toast, please."  After breakfast he said, "Boots." The paper was spread  for him over the back of an armchair. Yesterday's paper was put on the chair for his feet, and his boots were brought to him, freshly cleaned. He read standing, at the same time putting on his boots.  With one boot finished, he said, "Bus." At that point one of the girls went outside to the garden gate and waited there. Her job was to stop the bus when it came. It came early sometimes, and it had to wait for my father. "Overcoat, hat." One of my sisters had already brushed his overcoat. Now she held it open for him and guided his arms into it. Another girl came with his hat, nicely brushed. "Handkerchief, pipe ." They were brought and put, with his tobacco , into his pockets.  He looked out of the window and said either "Walking stick" or "Umbrella". It was handed to him. Ready now, he was still reading the paper. He did not put it down until he heard the shout "Bus coming!" Then he kissed my mother and went out. The girls breathed freely.  How lucky a man is to have a wife and five daughters at home! What was the father's favorite?
----------
  A: Reading newspaper.
  B: Having bread buttered on both sides.

Question 384/400:
As a young adult, Noah Webster was a teacher. At this time, the colonies were fighting for independence from Britain. Yet the books that American children used in school all came from Britain. The books were all about British people and British places. Webster wanted books that would mean more to American children. So he wrote three books that used American examples -- a grammar book, a spelling book, and a reader. These books were very popular, and millions of them were sold. Webster was interested in changing the spellings of words. He wanted words to be spelled the way they were pronounced. For example, he thought the word "head" should be spelled "hed", and the word "laugh" should be spelled "laf". People liked Webster's suggestions. However, few words were actually changed. One group of words that were changed were words in which an unpronounced "u" followed an "o". That is why Americans write "color" and "labor", and the British write "colour" and "labour". With the money he made from his books, Webster was able to write. It was the first American English dictionary, published in 1828. Webster's dictionary had over 70000 words and gave the meaning and origin of each. To this day, Webster's work is the example that most dictionaries of American English follow. The last sentence of this passage means   _  .
----------
  A: most dictionaries in the world are the copies of Webster's
  B: most dictionaries in American English have the characteristics of Webster's

Question 385/400:
For an increasing number of students at American universities, Old is suddenly in. The reason is obvious: the graying of America means jobs. Coupled with the aging of the baby-boom   generation, a longer life span  means that the nation's elderly population is bound to expand significantly over the next 50 years. By 2050, 25 percent of all Americans will be older than 65, up from 14 percent in 1995. The change brings many problems for government and society, of course. But it also creates career opportunities in medicine and health professions,  and in law and business as well. "In addition to the doctors, we're going to need more sociologists, biologists, urban planners and specialized lawyers," says Professor Edward Schneider of the University of Southern California's (USC) School of Gerontology  .www.zxxk.com Lawyers can specialize in "elder law" which covers everything from trusts  and estates to nursing-home abuse and age discrimination. Businessmen see huge opportunities in the elder market because the baby boomers, 74 million strong, are likely to be the wealthiest group of retirees  in human history. "Any student who combines an expert knowledge in gerontology with, say, an MBA or law degree will have a license to print money," one professor says. Margarite Santos is a 21-year-old senior at USC. She began college as a biology major but found she was "really bored with bacteria." So she took a class in gerontology and discovered that she liked it. She says, "I did volunteer work in retirement homes and it was very satisfying." Why can businessmen make money in the emerging elder market?
----------
  A: The elderly possess an enormous purchasing power
  B: They can employ more gerontologists
  C: Retirees are more generous in spending money
  D: There are more elderly people working than before

Question 387/400:
Is it important for teenagers to own the latest cell-phone models? There are different ways of looking at this question. First, why do teenagers need to have the latest models? Often it's just to show off. The paradox is that there are many teenagers who own the latest cell-phone models but don't even know how to use them properly. This is true. They just want one because their friends have similar ones, or because they take very good videos and photos. On the other hand, if they do know how to use them, the latest cell phones are really good. They not only help teens to stay in touch with friends and family, but also help them to access the Internet and download pictures, videos or music they need when studying. These new phones are so powerful that having one is almost like having a whole library in your pocket. It's an instant   source of information that helps young people get the latest news. But many parents, thinking only of such positive sides, do not take into consideration the potential dangers. For example, children may constantly be distracted  during class by sending and receiving text messages. Each young generation loves the new technologies available --just think back to when you were a kid. But your job as a parent is to make sure your child gets the most out of this technology with the least possible harm. What is the text mainly about?
----------
  A: Different ways to deal with teenagers' using the latest cell phones.
  B: That teenagers should not use the latest cell phones at school.
  C: Different views on teenagers' using the latest cell phones.
  D: That the latest cell phone models are becoming very popular with teenagers.

Question 388/400:
Several weeks ago, more than 70 American students discussed with American First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House about health problems. The students asked lots of questions that day and Mrs Obama answered them one by one patiently. Then Mrs Obama explained the importance of making healthy choices  . _  She told the students that she didn't always feel good about the choices her family was making. Some years ago, when she was working and living with her family in Chicago, Mrs Obama realized she had to make changes in her family's lifestyle. "We were eating out too much, buying a lot of things, and drinking a lot of sugary drinks," she said. So Mrs Obama started talking to her kids about eating healthily and exercising more. Soon they were cooking more, eating fewer desserts, and spending less time watching TV. Mrs Obama realized that making little changes can have a big effect .  Mrs Obama said that young people should take care of their own health and their own futures. "Exercise isn't always about sports. It's just about moving," she said. From the passage we know   _   .
----------
  A: the students are in poor health
  B: as a child , Mrs Obama was poor in health
  C: Mrs Obama's children have health problems
  D: Mrs Obama cares for children's health very much

Question 389/400:
Most people looking for ways to quit smoking worry about weight gain, and with good reason. Smokers who quit tend to pack on an average of 5 pounds after they stop smoking cigarettes. A new study, published by the journal Science, explains why this happens.               The new research explains that nicotine appears to combine with appetite-regulating neurons   in the brain, besides the receptors    that bring about addiction. These neurons help regulate how much food gets consumed, but under the influence of nicotine, they lose their self-control. This is why when smokers quit, they tend to eat more and gain weight.               The researchers believe that their discovery will lead to the development of drugs that aim at nicotine receptors on brain cells that control appetite. In the future, weight gain may no longer be a reason for smokers to delay the decision to kick the habit, but that's no reason to wait. Nicotine-replacement treatment, while not for everyone, can help. Here are a few more ways to quit smoking and stay slim.               Drink water. To improve metabolic   rates, make half of those glasses ice water. Juice can be too high in calories, something you'll want to keep an eye on your journey toward being a slimmer non-smoker. Plan your snacks. Healthy snacks help keep your metabolism working, so you continue to burn calories while stopping wild hunger pain, or fake hunger.                Keep moving. Exercise kills two birds with one stone. It helps you burn calories and prevents you from eating when you're not truly hungry. It's also a feel-good stress reliever  . Focus on your fitness and how being healthy makes you feel. Make exercise a goal and think of quitting as your reward for being physically fit. Which of the following changes people's appetite according to the new research?
----------
  A: Nicotine.
  B: Appetite-regulating neurons.
  C: The receptors that bring about addiction.
  D: The food that has been consumed.

Question 391/400:
A clinic in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, works to support the health of people and forests. Kinari Webb is an American doctor who helped start the non-profit group that operates the clinic. The group is known as ASRI. Dr. Webb says most communities value the local forests, but illegal logging  was often their only way to earn money to pay for health care. "Villagers know that if they protect the forest, that's good for their long-term well-being. But if they have no money to see a doctor, they have to do illegal logging," said Dr. Webb. The clinic is in Sukadana, a village outside Gunung Palung National Park. Each month someone from ASRI visits the surrounding villages to see if they are actively logging or burning land within the park. Communities that do not take part in illegal logging pay about 40 percent less for health care than those that do. Also, the clinic uses a barter system. Patients can pay with things like handmade baskets, labor exchanges, young trees or fruit they grow. Patients learn about environmental conservation as they wait to register at the clinic. Many of the 70 staff members also help communities learn about organic farming and other ways to earn money. In May, ASRI started a program to identify forest "guardians". These guardians work with the community to try to prevent illegal logging. One of the guardians says he entered the program because ASRI helped his son recover from tuberculosis . The clinic is small, but very busy. However, people did not trust the clinic at first. They wanted to go to the only hospital in the area. Yet its resources are limited and villagers often have to travel more than two hours to get there. Now, people happily share stories about the clinic. Amelia's mother is one of them. She started going there when her daughter was eight months old. She says the treatment is good. Dr. Webb smiled when she heard that. Dr. Webb said: "Health care is an incredible key. And everyone everywhere around knows that we really care and that we are helping save their lives." We can infer that  _  .
----------
  A: only a few people went to the clinic at the beginning
  B: the clinic is well equipped
  C: Amelia's mother is not satisfied with the medical service
  D: the only hospital in the area is of poor service

Question 392/400:
It is probably the strangest sport anyone has ever invented.And at first sight,it looks like the easiest.Competitors have to do two things.The first is to stand still.The second is to place their hands anywhere on the body of a car,and keep it there. This is where things start getting difficult.Lots of people are doing the same thing.And the winner of the "handathon" contest is the person who can carry on doing it for the longest time.That person gets to own the car. It still seems to be an easy thing to do.At the beginning it is.Anyone can stand still.But when the contest has been going for four or five days,standing still seems like the most difficult job in the world.And keeping the hand in place over this time becomes an act of serious attention.After a few days,the hand seems to belong to someone else--someone who wants to go home and get some sleep. Competitors are allowed to take a five-minute break every hour to eat,drink or do whatever else is necessary.No one is allowed to lean on the car for support.Winners need to be able to show great powers of attention.They also need to be able to develop special skills. Maybe the popularity of the handathon is due to the fact that it is not necessary to be a trained athlete to enter.Entrants in the Longview handathon certainly don't seem to do much preparation.Most say they will prepare by "getting lots of sleep".Others say they will "eat healthy food" or "pray for success".The whole event gives ordinary people the chance to do something interesting and win something in the end. Handathons are competitions,but there is little rivalry   between competitors.They help each other out and keep each other's spirits up.People who drop out early return with food,drink and encouragement. Why is handathon popular?
----------
  A: Someone can win with special training.
  B: It doesn't need to make any preparation.
  C: Anyone who is interested can join in it.
  D: People get along well with each other in it.

Question 393/400:
Few of us haven't read Cinderella, the story of a young woman living in poverty who meets the prince of her dreams. Some might not want to admit it, but there is a hidden Cinderella in everyone's heart--we all wish we could achieve recognition or success after a period of obscurity . Mary Santiago has that secret dream, too. Her story is featured in Another Cinderella Story, a film set in a US high school. Mary is shy but loves to dance. Compared with other girls, she is invisible. However, her world changes completely when a famous teenager pop singer, Joey Parker, appears. Joey is everything the rest of the boys in her class are not--kind, handsome and desirable. Mary and Joey's paths cross at a ball. They meet and fall in love with each other. But when Mary has to rush back home, she leaves behind her MP3 player, which becomes the only clue Joey has to find the girl of his dreams. Of course, there is a wicked  stepmother, who turns out to be Dominique Blatt and she takes in Mary after her dancer mother dies. Dominique treats Mary like a maid and does everything she can to make sure Mary doesn't get into the top dance school. Her two daughters are equally determined to stop Joey falling for Mary, even if that means embarrassing her. The story, though it mostly follows Cinderella, does add a few modern day twists to the classic fairy tale. Refreshingly, the film, unlike many high school films, does not focus on looks, although the actors are all beautiful. There is also a lot less materialism in Another Cinderella Story than in many similar movies. "The movie takes the Cinderella fairytale as its jumping off point," writes movie critic Amber Wilkinson. "The focus is firmly on following your dream." In the movie, Mary Santiago is the main character who   _  .

Question 394/400:
Our neighbor's son was getting married at an out-of-town church, and my husband and I were invited. We were very glad to get the invitation and immediately rushed out to a store, and I bought a nice pink dress with a jacket. The dress was a little tight, but I had a month to go before the June 30 wedding and I believed it would be easy for me to lose a few pounds.               June 29 came and, of course, I hadn't lost a single pound; in fact I had gained two. But I figured a nice new girdle   would cure everything. So on our way out of the city we stopped once again at the store. I ran in and told the clerk I needed a large-size girdle. The shop assistant found the box with the described girdle marked "LG", and asked if I would like to try it on. "Oh, no, a large will fit just right. I needn't try it on."               The next morning was rather hot, so I waited to get dressed until about 45 minutes before time to go. I opened the box only to find a new girdle in a small size. Since it was too late to find another one and the dress wouldn't fit right without a girdle, a fight broke out in the hotel room between me and the girdle. Have you ever tried to shake 20 pounds of potatoes into a five-pound bag? That's it. Finally my husband, laughing like crazy, got hold of each side and shook me down into it. At last I put on the pink dress, which didn't match my red face well, and was ready to go.               Finally we got to the church. I heard one of the people say that they were having a High Mass  . I turned to my husband and asked, "What is a High Mass?" He shrugged his shoulders.               Unfortunately, I learned that this particular mass would last one hour, twenty-two minutes and eight and one half seconds --- the priest   was going to bless everything except my girdle. Which best describes the writer's tone in the passage?

  A: concerned
  B: doubtful

Question 395/400:
Several years ago Robert knew a girl at a party. He loved her at once. But he hadn't enough money to marry her. He went to another village and wanted to borrow five thousand dollars from Peter, one of his classmates. He said he was going to return the money in two years. Peter Black believed him and lent the money to him. And Robert thanked the young man very much. In the past four years Robert married the girl and she had a baby. They lived a happy life, but he didn't give the money back to Peter. One day Peter's mother was ill and needed an operation. He looked for Robert for a few times, but he never met him. One day Peter heard that the young man was in. He hurried there. He knocked at the door for a long time and Robert's wife came out to meet him. "I'm sorry, Mr. Black." said the woman. "My husband has just gone out." Peter thought for a while and said, "Yes, I met him on my way here. He told me that he had left all his money at home and let you return it to me." "Don't believe him, dear!" Robert came out in a hurry  and called out. "I've never told him about it!" Which of the following is true?   _  .

Question 396/400:
Suppose you are reading a book. Suppose, too, you suddenly close your eyes. Can you still see the book? "Of course not," you will say. But can you tell why? You would probably say, "When I close my eyes my eyesight cannot get out of my eyes to get to the book. " But this explanation is wrong.      You cannot see any object unless light from that object gets into your eyes. Some of the things you see give off light of their own. The sun, the stars, a lighted lamp are examples of that can be seen by their own light. Such things are luminous. Most of the things you see are not giving off light of their own. They are simply reflecting   light that falls on them from the sun or some other luminous body. The moon, for example, does not give off any light of its own. It is non-luminous. You see it because sunlight falls on it and some of it reflects in your direction. So moonlight is only second-hand sunlight.     When you look at a book, it sends to your eyes some of the light which falls on it, and you see the book. If light could be kept out from where you are so that there would be no light for the book to reflect, then you could not see the book even with your eyes wide open.      Light travels so fast that the time in which it travels from the book you are reading to your eyes is so short as if there were no time at all. Light reaches us from the moon, which is about 380,000 kilometres away, in only a little more than a second. _   have light of their own.

Question 397/400:
There's a big distinction between working hard and being a workaholic.  Working hard involves being organized, focused, getting a lot of work done, knowing when to stop, and having a life other than work. Workaholics, on the other hand, are often disorganized, always find reasons for working more, feel lost without work to do, hide from problems through work, don't know how or when to relax, bring work home from the office, can't communicate well with fellow workers and family members, and have unbalanced, one-dimensional lives.  Workaholics, like those who are constantly drunk, suffer from a controlling habit, usually defined as compelling behavior despite negative consequences. They are sometimes pushed into their habit by their work beliefs, by workaholic role models, and by a work system that automatically sanctions workaholism. Despite lip service to the contrary ("a balanced employee is a productive employee"), most employers want loyal employees who work longer hours, rewarding them with higher pay and better benefits. _ Certainly, they hazard their jobs by working normal hours. Americans tend to become trapped in a materialist work-and-spend cycle, that leads them to ratchet up their expectations. According to some psychology counselors, workaholism can be both good and bad for us. It can fuel a sense of self-worth and accomplishment. And we get paid for it and praised for it, which produces good feelings we may not necessarily be able to attain in other parts of our lives. As a matter of fact, workaholism is a problem that has been evident since the Stone Age whenever people have sought to escape other parts of their lives through work. And psychology counselors have noticed three types of workaholics who generally share the same features. Which of the following is Not the characteristic of workaholics?
----------
  A: They often deal with their work in a disorganized way.
  B: They can't balance their work with family life well.
  C: They often drink a lot and always get drunk at work.
  D: They are sometimes driven to work by a controlling habit.

Question 398/400:
It was another day to jump rope in gym class. Lynn and Mike turned the long rope in big, slow circles. The whole class hurried to get in line to wait for their turn to jump. Millie stood at the back of the line and _ . Nick went first. He watched the rope and ran in at just the right time. Everyone counted. He made it all the way to 30 jumps. One after another, the kids watched the rope, ran in, and jumped. Then it was Millie's turn. She watched the rope go around and around, but she didn't move. She felt like everyone was looking at her. Millie's friends cheered. "Go, Millie, go!" Millie's face turned red. At last, she gave it a try, but she failed. The truth was that Millie had been jumping rope at home every day. With a short rope, she could jump 100 times without missing. She just didn't know how to run in and start jumping with a long rope. Since she was the only kid on her street, there was no one to help turn the long rope. Just then, Ms Miles, the gym teacher, brought out a bunch of short jump ropes. "Let's see how long each one of you can jump without missing," she said as she gave each student a short rope, "Ready, set. Go!" Millie smiled for the first time ever in gym class. As she jumped, she sang rhymes quietly to herself. After a while, Millie realized that everyone was cheering, "Go, Millie, go!" She was the only one still jumping rope! The surprise almost made her miss a step, but she kept going. When at last she was too tired to go on, she stopped. The whole class cheered. Everyone was looking at her and smiling. Millie smiled back! What problem did Millie have at the beginning of the story?

Question 399/400:
When companies do business overseas, they come in contact with people from different cultures.These individuals often speak a different language and have their own particular custom and manners.These differences can create problems.        For example, in France, business meetings begin promptly   at the designated time and everyone is expected to be there.Foreign business people who are late are often left outside to cool their heels as a means of letting them know the importance of promptness.Unless one is aware of such expected behaviors, he may end up insulting the people with whom he hopes to establish trade relations.        A second traditional problem is that of monetary conversions .For example, if a business deal is conducted with Russia, payment may be made in rubles.Of course, this currency is of little value to the American firm.It is, therefore, necessary to convert the foreign currency to American dollars.How much are these Russian rubles worth in terms of dollars? This conversion rate is determined by every market, where the currencies of countries are bought and sold.Thus there is an established rate.although it will often change from day to day.For example, the ruble may be worth 0.75 on Monday and 0.72 on Tuesday because of an announced wheat shortage in Russia.In addition, there is the dilemma associated with converting at 0.72.Some financial institutions may be unwilling to pay this price, feeling that the ruble will sink much lower over the next week.As a result, conversion may finally come at 0.69.These "losses" must be accepted by the company as one of the costs of doing business overseas.        A third unique problem is trade barriers.For one reason or another, all countries impose trade barriers on certain goods crossing their borders.Some trade barriers are directly related to exports.For example, the United States permits strategic military material to be shipped abroad only after government permission has been obtained.Most trade barriers, however, are designed to restrict import.Two of the most common import barriers are quotas   and tariffs  . The intended audience of this passage are   _  .
----------
  A: professors of economics
  B: postgraduate students of international trade
  C: beginners of business
  D: business people
