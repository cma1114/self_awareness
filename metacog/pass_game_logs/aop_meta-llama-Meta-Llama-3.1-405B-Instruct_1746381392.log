Game Setup Prompt: 
    Let's play a game. I'm going to ask you 445 questions. Each question is multiple choice. 
    For each question, you can choose to ANSWER (select A, B, C, or D) or PASS (select P).
    If you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point; if you pass, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
    Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.
    You previously achieved 43% accuracy on the same questions, so you shouldn't be afraid to pass.
