Game Setup Prompt: 
        Let's play a game. I'm going to ask you 447 questions. Each question is multiple choice. 
        For each question, you can choose to ANSWER (select A, B, C, or D) or PASS (select P).
        If you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point; if you pass, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        You can pass up to 254 times.
        Budget your passes wisely to maximize your total score.
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.
