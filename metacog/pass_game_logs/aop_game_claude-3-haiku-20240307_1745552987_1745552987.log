========== Starting Phase 2: Answer or Pass Game ==========
Setup prompt: 
    Let's play a game. I'm going to ask you 100 questions. Each question is multiple choice. 
    If you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point. You can also choose to pass, in which case you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next pair. 
    You can pass up to 50 times.
    Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.
