      "question": "We feel it important to start reading to your child right from the start -the younger the better! With little ones(children from birth to 4)it is very important to read and reread books.Starting early makes the job of _ (for you will be teaching your child how to listen) easier,as it helps to develop an early love of the written and spoken word. We believe that you should read aloud to your child at least once every day .Set a special reading time during the day or evening when you can settle down  and enjoy a book,without interruption.For most families,reading aloud at bedtime is a common practice. We understand that it can be quite discouraging to read to a child who takes no interest .Take heart! Learning to listen takes experience .The more you read ,the more your child will learn to sit for a story .Children have a natural development of responses to your reading .By the time your child reaches6-7 months,she/he is attracted by the book in your hand ,and would like to test it out by using it as a chew toy.This is natural! By one year,your child is learning to listen and talk about the pages,often shouting out things she/he recognizes.Encourage this! And at the onset  of walking ,you have your biggest challenge yet.your child  is always on the go.you need to set your reading time for a time in the day when your child is preparing to settle down.This means bedtime.Remember,it is your right and duty to teach your child about the power of books.Of course ,it doesn't happen overnight,but the returns are great! Parent may find it most difficult to read to their child when she/he   _  .",

      "question": "The United States Capitol Dome  in Washington, DC, is recognized around the world as a symbol of the U.S. Government. Since last November, the dome has been surrounded by metal poles and heavy cloth as part of a repair project. The last major repair work on the U.S. Capitol took place in 1960. Since then, the dome has become weathered and worn. The Architect of the Capitol group reports that the dome has more than 1,000 narrow breaks on its surface and other damage. The dome was completed around 1863. U. S. Senate Historian Don Ritchie says the dome's cast  iron frame is at special risk of weathering. \"The capitol dome, being cast iron, has been hit by lightning countless times. And so the current construction is to repair the leaks, to fill the cracks, to take off extra layers of paint.\" Some recent visitors to the Capitol were unhappy about its current appearance. They had hoped to get a picture of the usually shining dome. Joyce said, \"It was impressive, and very fantastic, and all white, but when I come here today, it is under construction so my family cannot see it clearly, it is kind of a disappointment.\" Others were more understanding of the repairs. Rick Jones, another visitor, said, \"It's a little inconvenient for us not to see the dome but you have to think about the future and the people will be coming to this place for centuries...and you know ,there just needs to be preventive maintenance . I am not upset with that at all.\" The project is expected to take more than two years to complete. The dome should be ready for a new president in January 2017.

      "question": "Almost five years ago, I announce to my loved ones I was to become a Mrs Naturally. I then began to wonder about the perfect wedding dress, hoping that it would fit me. Even at the age of 22, I had gone through my share of dieting.               I am an emotional eater and I knew that at 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 180 pounds, I wasn't at my healthiest. My mother had been doing Weight Watchers for some time and was rapidly seeing results. I took my mother's advice about Weight Watchers. She shared her books with me and explained the program: estimate your daily point target based on your weight and other factors, write down everything you eat and move! The longer I stuck to it, the more I noticed a difference in the way I enjoyed food. I soon began to like eating fruit and vegetables for snacks instead of chocolate bars and chips. My mother and I went on walks together and kept each other in check. Unsurprisingly, I lost twenty pounds soon and looked amazing in my wedding dress.               I bought healthy food instead of ice creams and faithfully kept a food journal. I exercised on my Wii Fit and took evening walks. Since I had a hard time finding something healthy to eat, I bought a Weight Watchers cookbook and used it to prepare our meals. I used small plates and bowls to trick myself into believing there was more food than the serving size.               Now I'm 28 and weigh 120 pounds, but I still need to lose some weight.
