========== Starting Phase 2: Answer or Pass Game ==========
Setup prompt: 
    Let's play a game. I'm going to ask you 100 questions. Each question is multiple choice. 
    For each question, you can choose to ANSWER (select A, B, C, or D), if you think you know the correct answer, or PASS (select P) if you're not sure.
    If you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point; if you pass, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
    Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.
