Question 185/400:
One of the best things you can do for your health is to drop a few pounds. Or maybe morethan a few pounds.  Being overweight increases your danger of heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer,,the list seems almost endless. You'd better find several simple things you can do on a daily basis  such as making rules of eating more vegetables and less fat and getting more physical activities.  After breakfast, make water your primary drink. At breakfast, go ahead and drink orange juice. But throughout the rest of the day, focus on water instead of juice or soda. The average American consumes  an extra 245 calories a day from soft drinks. That's nearly 90,000 calories a year -- or 25 pounds! And research shows that neither the calories nor sugary drinks give you a sense of fullness the way that food does.  People take only 2,000 to 3, 000 steps a day. Adding 2,000 steps will help you keep your present weight and stop gaining weight. Adding more than that will help you lose weight.  Eat five or six small meals or snacks a day instead of three large meals. A 1999 South African study found that when men ate parts of their morning meal at intervals over five hours, they consumed almost 20 percent fewer calories at lunch than when they ate a single breakfast. Where is the passage probably taken from?
----------
  A: A travelling diary.
  B: A story book.
  C: A science magazine.

Question 186/400:
Tom, a 15-year-old boy, couldn't hear anything after the whole night computer games and MP3 listening. He was excited and yelled   after the MP3. When he walked out of his room the next morning, he could hear nothing about his mother's words. His mother sent him to the doctor at once. It was moderate   hearing loss  . Do you have an MP3 player? Do you use it to listen to your favorite music? A survey   shows that lots of young people enjoy listening to their MP3 players. And they always listen to them at high volumes  . There are about 100 million people listening to MP3 players in Europe every day. Most of them are young people. Scientists have found that if people listen to MP3 players at a very high volume for more than five hours a week, they could lose their hearing in five years. High-volume music can keep people excited, so young people would like to keep their players high. It's too bad for the ears. So the MP3 listeners should keep the player within safe volume levels, no higher than 60~70 of full capacity  . If people near you can hear your MP3, that means you are keeping your MP3 at a very high volume, turn it down, please! What is the best title of this passage?
----------
  A: a Deaf   Boy
  B: an MP3 Player
  C: the Harm   of High Volume
  D: a Survey

Question 188/400:
Charles Dickens was one of the most beloved storytellers in the English language. His novels made him famous in his own time, and continue as classics in ours.      Dickens began his literary career with almost no formal education. He was born in Landport, on Feb. 7, 1812, the second of eight children. When he was 12, his father was sent to debtor's prison. Dickens was forced to quit school and work in a London blacking factory. He would rework that terrible experience into his fiction for the rest of his life.      "He was a social reformer," says actor Simon Callow, author of a new biography called Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World.  "He knew what poverty was. He knew what it was to be rejected, to be cast aside, to  live in squalor  ."      And so Dickens wrote with great sympathy for the suffering of innocent and vulnerable   children - characters like David Copperfield, Little Dorrit and the orphan, Oliver Twist:       With his slice of bread in his hand, and his little brown parish cap on his head, Oliver was now led away from the wretched home, where one kind word or look never lighted the gloom of his infant   days.       Yet he burst into an agony of childish grief as the cottage gate closed after him.  Wretched as were the little companions in,misery he was now leaving behind him, they were the only friends he had ever had.       His first book Sketches by Boz came out in 1836. With the appearance of Oliver Twist in London periodicals in 1837, the 25-year-old Dickens became the most popular writer in England. But his first love was theater, and he considered becoming an actor.      "When he was actually writing, he became his characters," says Peter Ackroyd, author of Dickens: Public Life and Private Passion. "He would get up from his desk, go over to the mirror and mouth the words - do the expressions, grimaces  , whatever, and then laugh, chuckle to himself, then go back to his desk and write it down."      Dickens created 989 named characters, which increased his popularity. Every one of his major works has been adapted for either stage or screen. A Christmas Carol inspired more than a dozen films, from Alistair Sims' Scrooge in 1951 to Jim Carrey's voicing of the same character in Disney's 2009, 3-D animated film.      The original 1843 manuscript  of A  Christmas Carolis on display at the Morgan Library. Dickens wrote everything by hand, in tiny script, with a quill pen. Remarkably, the manuscript is both the first and the final draft, says Kiely, the curator. You can see where Dickens has changed the name of the first chapter from "Old Marley's Ghost" to "Marley's Ghost". Further down the page, he has canceled an entire section.      "He realizes he's not writing a novel, and he only has a very short time in which to write this," Kiely explains. "He's got to keep it tight, in order for it to be published in time for Christmas."      Dickens wrote all the time. He traveled with a portable inkwell and a supply of quill pens. He was working on his last novel, Our Mutual Friend, en route from France to London when the train he was on crashed.      Dickens died five years later in 1870, after a stroke at age 58. As a comic talent and a social reformer, Dickens' achievement was extraordinary, says novelist T.C. Boyle, who eamed a doctorate in Victorian literature.      "He achieved what any great artist achieves - a body of work that has entertained and delighted and instructed people down through the ages. That's what we all hope for," says Boyle.       But Dickens' greatest fiction was his own character, says Callow, the biographer: "People think of him as a cheerful man ... but he was increasingly suffering from depression and a sense of hopelessness. And that's worth knowing. I think it's always good to know that great creative individuals have their struggle, their drama." What can probably be reflected in Dickens' works?
----------
  A: His love for his family.
  B: His childhood sufferings.
  C: His desire for formal education.
  D: His reason to choose literary career.

Question 190/400:
Recently, a study showed that changes found in astronauts' eye tissue might cause vision problems, and possibly even blindness. As well as threatening the health of astronauts, this could influence long-distance missions into space. Larry Kramer of Texas Medical School in Houston and his colleagues carried out MRI scans on 27 NASA astronauts after they had spent an average of 108 days in space. About half of them had some problems in their optic nerve   or eyeball. The changes match those seen in people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, a rare condition in which the pressure of blood is abnormally high in the brain. People with the condition experience headaches, nausea   and vision problems including blindness. In space, the changes are probably caused by living in free fall. "It is not because of the sunlight in space or the spacecraft's function," says Kramer. "One likely reason is that blood which normally pools in the legs is shifted toward the skull  , raising pressure."  The findings are similar to the results of a survey of 300 astronauts carried out in 2011. The damage in vision was reported by 29 percent of astronauts on short-term missions, and 60 percent on long-term missions. "If astronauts are exhibiting these changes after only 100 days in space, what will happen on a three-year flight to Mars?" asks Jason Kring, who studies human performance in extreme conditions at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. "Deteriorating vision could seriously damage astronauts' ability to carry out routine mission tasks, including monitoring displays and navigating the rocky landscape of Mars," says Kring. "This possibility, combined with what we already know about how micro-gravity affects muscles and bones, paints a dark future for human space flight unless we start to develop effective measures." Kramer says that NASA has the matter in hand. In the wake of the study, all astronauts now have regular brain scans. This includes those yet to travel into space, providing a baseline   from which any changes would be obvious. He also believes it might be possible to identify astronauts' risk of eyesight damage from medical data before sending them into space. What is the main idea of the passage?
----------
  A: Space flight may be bad for astronauts' eyes.
  B: Scientists are doing research on astronauts' eyes.
  C: Some scientific problems exist in astronauts' eyes.
  D: Measures should be taken to protect astronauts' eyes.

Question 191/400:
The Piano Lesson Jenny wasn't interested in playing the piano. She liked writing stories and acting them out with her friends. But Mrs. Windsor gave her piano lessons for free, so she felt she should have a try. Every Sunday she had her piano lessons in Mrs. Windsor's house. One Sunday morning, Jenny walked into Mrs. Windsor's music room and sat down on the piano bench  as usual. "Hello," Jenny heard a voice behind her. She turned around and saw a young girl. "What's your name?" The girl asked. Before Jenny could answer, Mrs. Windsor walked in and said, "Jenny, this is my niece , Pasha. Pasha, this is Jenny. I need to go to hospital, so Pasha will give you your lesson today." Pasha sat beside Jenny on the piano bench and asked, "What piece do you like best?" "I don't know." Jenny said. "They're all the same to me." "You mean you don't have a favorite?" Pasha was surprised. "No, not really." Jenny said. Pasha opened Jenny's music book and asked Jenny to play. After about a page or two, Pasha gently  put her hand on top of Jenny's. Jenny stopped. Then Pasha said, "Jenny, what are you hearing in the music?" Jenny looked at Pasha strangely. "I don't know." Jenny said. "Let me try and you listen," Pasha said. "All you have to do is learn to hear the stories in the music." "I've never thought of it that way." Jenny said. "Let's try together, shall we?" Pasha smiled. Together they played that afternoon and tried to find the story in the music. That day Jenny found playing the piano was not that difficult. With Pasha's help, Jenny would probably   _  .

Question 192/400:
TAIBEI - Increasing numbers of Taiwanese students are joining the island's "China rush", seeking education on the Chinese mainland. According to official Chinese figures, the number of Taiwanese students admitted into college and postgraduate programs on the mainland totaled 461 in 1996, 928 in 1997 and 839 in 1998.Although no latest official numbers were available," Netbig.com Said this number had risen between 30 to 50 percent annually in the past two years with well over 1000 entering mainland campuses last year. The Internet site, based in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, provides education service and information on Chinese mainland colleges and universities. "Many Taiwanese believe a Chinese education giving more knowledge about the people and culture in the mainland will increase their chances in the Chinese job market, Net.com vice-president Ingrid Huang said."I believe _ will give me hands-on experience in the business field in the Chinese mainland and a better understanding of the Chinese mainland people," said Lydia Chang, a 19-year-old majoring in journalism at Shih Shin University. Chang plans to go on to get a master's degree in business administration in Shanghai, which she says offers the best environment for such studies. A journalism graduate student, surnamed Lin, at the National Taiwan University said he would like to study law on the Chinese mainland since "there will be better career prospects now that more Taiwanese companies are going there". "They hope the children could build up connections which could later become useful in their business operations," said Yang Ching-yao, professor of the Chinese mainland studies. A Netbig.com survey showed the campuses favored by Taiwan students included Beijing, Qinghua and Renmin universities in Beijing, and Jinan and Zhongshan universities in Guangzhou. The most popular studies were law, business and Chinese medicine. At present, Chinese Taibei doesn't recognize diplomas earned in the Chinese mainland nor help with any inquiries about studying there. But recognizing the trend, education authorities are giving a final form to a policy accepting certificates from selected universities. Some business executives were sending their children to study in the Chinese mainland so that their children   _  .

Question 195/400:
It's not every week that England's greatest playwright William Shakespeare hits the headlines, but the Bard of Avon   has been the subject of two news stories in recent days as new information has come to light about the writer and his working environment. In the first development, a portrait of Shakespeare, which is believed to be the only picture painted of him during his lifetime, was _ in London. The artwork has been dated back to 1610, meaning it was painted six years before the writer's death. The painting had been owned by a family descended from Shakespeare's literary patron   tor hundreds of years without them ever knowing who the man in the picture was. Alec Cobbe, who inherited the portrait, realized that the painting was a likeness of Shakespeare after visiting an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery where he saw a portrait that had, until 70 years ago, been accepted as a life portrait of Shakespeare. Mr Cobhe immediately realized he was looking at a copy of the painting that had been in his family for centuries. The painting will now go on display in Shakespeare's hometown Stratford-upon-Avon. In a separate story, archaeologists in London believe they have unearthed the remains of Shakespeare's first theatre. The site was excavated  by a team from the Museum of London last summer, and is believed to have been built in 1576. Experts think that Shakespeare himself acted at the theatre, which may have been where the play Romeo and Juliet was premiered  . It is believed that 25 years after construction, the building was pulled down and moved timber by timber to the South Bank of the Thames, where a reconstruction of the theatre now stands. .Before visiting the exhibition, Alec Cobbe   _  .
----------
  A: knew his painting was a copy of the portrait of Shakespeare
  B: thought his painting was a little like Shakespeare
  C: realized his painting was very valuable

Question 196/400:
Once there was a man who lied to eat mangoes. One day he decided to get the sweetest mango from the very top of the tree. Mangoes which are exposed to the sun the most are the sweetest. So he climbed up to the top, where the branches were thin. He managed to pick up a few sweet reddish fruits, but, in an attempt to climb down, he slipped and started falling towards the ground. Fortunately, he caught the branch as he was falling and remained helplessly hanging on the tree. Then he started to call nearby villagers for help. They immediately came with a ladder and sticks, but could do little to help him. Then after some time one calm and thoughtful person arrived - a well-known sage who lived in a simple hut nearby. People were very curious to see what he would do, as he was famous in solving many people's problems in the area and sometimes very complicated ones. He was silent for a minute and then picked up a stone and threw it at the hanging man. Everybody was surprised. The hanging mango lover started to shout: What are you doing?! Are you crazy? Do you want me to break my neck?"  The sage was silent. Then he took another stone and threw it at the man. The man was very angry: "If I could just come down, I would show you!" That's what everybody wanted - that he came down. But how? Now everybody was tense, as to what would happen next! Some wanted to chastise the sage, but they didn't. The sage picked another stone and threw it again at the man, even more forcefully. Now the man on the tree was enraged and developed a great determination to come down and take revenge.  He then used all his skill and strength and somehow reached the branches which were safe to start going down. And he made it! Everybody was amazed. However, the rescued man found the sage gone. He stood there, realizing that the man really sed him because he induced him to try his best and save himself. "I should be thankful and not angry." What does the story imply?
----------
  A: Anger saves one's life.
  B: Wisdom does count.
  C: Skill and strength count.
  D: Anger is the biggest enemy.

Question 198/400:
As I was leaving to meet Lynne, my roommate told me that I'd better take some money. But I didn't listen to him. I thought that Lynne would pay because she had invited me. I arrived at the restaurant exactly on time. I'd been told that Americans expect you to be on time. Lynne and I sat at a table in the corner of restaurant and a waitress came and took our order. The dinner was a great success. I talked a lot about Saudi Arabia and Lynne told me all about herself. After two hours, the waitress finally came and asked if we wanted one check or two. Lynne said two. We went to the cashier and Lynne paid her check. I was embarrassed   when the cashier gave me my bill. I had no money to pay for my meal. Then I had an idea. I pretended to look for something in my pockets and said, "Oh! I forgot my wallet! Can I call my roommate, please?" The cashier showed me where the phone was and I quickly called my roommate. In a few minutes, he arrived with some money, but he couldn't hide how he felt. He laughed all the way home. Now, I think it's funny too, but at that time I was terribly embarrassed. I thought that an invitation to have dinner in the United States meant the same thing as that in China. I guess you have to understand that your customs are only your customs. When you visit a foreign country, you have to learn about their customs, too. The roommate laughed all the way home because   _  .

Question 199/400:
Robert Todd Duncan was born in 1903 in the southern city of Danville,Kentucky. His mother was his first music teacher. As a young man,he continued his music study in Indianapolis,Indiana. In 1930,he completed more musical education at Columbia University in New York City. Then he moved to Washington. For fifteen years, he taught music at Howard University in Washington. At that time, not many black musicians were known for writing or performing classical music. Teaching at Howard gave Duncan the chance to share his knowledge of classical European music with a mainly black student population. He taught special ways to present the music.These special ways became known as the Duncan Technique. Besides teaching,Duncan sang in several operas with performers who were all black. But it seemed that he always would be known mainly as a concert artist. However,his life took a different turn in the middle 1930s. At that time, the famous American music writer George Gershwin was looking for someone to play a leading part in his new work Porgy and Bess. The music critic   of the New York Times newspaper suggested Todd Duncan. Duncan had almost decided not to try for the part as he knew it would not be easy to get it. But he changed his mind. He sang a piece from an Italian opera for Gershwin. He had sung only a few minutes when Gershwin offered him the part. He became famous because of the part in Porgy and Bess. Todd Duncan gained fame as an opera singer and concert artist. But his greatest love in music was teaching. When he stopped teaching at Howard,he continued giving singing lessons in his Washington home until the week before his death. We can infer that Robert Todd Duncan didn't at first want to try for the part mainly because  _  .
----------
  A: he was too busy to do it
  B: he was not interested in it
  C: he was not confident enough
  D: he didn't want to become famous

Question 200/400:
One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. "We've had to make a difficult decision," Mr. Tisich announced. "You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago." Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. "It's surprising, but exciting!" she said. Marc simply said, "We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!" The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly. What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. What would most likely happen next?
----------
  A: Marc would bring his records over to the Lyons's house.
  B: Mr. and Mrs. Tisich would call the police.
  C: Marc would join his family for house moving.
  D: Mr. and Mrs. Tisich would start searching for Marc.

Question 201/400:
The passengers on the subway who caught a glimpse of me may have thought I was strange. In particular a gentleman sitting opposite me was always staring at me, looking at the cheese bread on the floor in front of me and then staring back at me. A passenger probably dropped it by mistake and got off at a previous stop, but the gentleman might not think so. "Next stop, St. Patrick Station" -- my stop was quickly coming up. I had few minutes to either take the cheese bread, which nobody else was claiming, or left it there. In those few minutes I felt my pride getting in the way. "What would others on the subway think of me if I took the cheese bread? Would they think that I was poor and hungry? Would they think that I was stealing?" The ignorant thing to do was say "yes" to any of those _ questions. Actually, they were just my own thoughts. Though I would leave the subway, walk a block to my office, get settled at my desk, and sit comfortably in my office for the whole day, I couldn't get rid of the enormous sense of guilt and regret. My thoughts once pushed me towards pride and ignorance, but finally I had to admit I was wrong. This missing cheese bread could be a gift for a homeless person who suffered from cold and hunger. So why not overcome a little bit of my pride and pass along so much kindness? Just as the doors opened at my stop, I grabbed the cheese bread and left the subway. It felt awesome, but I didn't care if people were looking at me or what they were thinking. Instead of going directly to my office as usual, I walked a few more blocks up to Queen's park, where I often saw a homeless man sitting outside. I always wanted to give him something, but only today I walked toward him, who wrapped himself in a sleeping bag. I was full of satisfaction, and so did the homeless man, I thought. Why did the author grab the cheese bread when he got off?
----------
  A: He noticed that no one was looking at him.
  B: He didn't want to see the cheese bread to go to taste.
  C: He valued kindness more than his own pride.
  D: He remembered a homeless man at that very moment.

Question 203/400:
On Saturday Patrick woke up with a little shock, knowing that this was a special day. For a moment he couldn't think exactly why, and then, with an excited flutter of his stomach, he remembered. At ten o'clock today he was going to find out the final result of the programme called Super Brain. He got dressed more carefully than usual, went downstairs and turned on the TV. Quickly he switched channels. Cartoons, cartoons, advertisements, man talking, snow, snow... and still nothing at all on Channel 8. "Patrick, turn it off, darling, if you're going to watch." Judith walked past with the newspaper under her arm and her eyes half closed. She headed for the kitchen. Patrick turned off the TV and followed. "What's for breakfast, Mum?" "We will see," Judith said in a low voice, turning on the electric kettle  . She looked sleepily at him and smiled. "You look nice, darling," She said. "You're all ready. But we can't go till eight-thirty at the earliest, you know. Nothing will be open till then." Patrick's stomach seemed to feel a little sick. "We aren't going out, are we?" He asked. Judith began to make the tea. "Don't say you've forgotten!" she said, "I promised you, last Saturday. Your new trainers, remember?" "Oh--oh, but I can't go out this morning, Mum. There's something I've got to watch on TV. At ten o'clock. I've got to! My trainers will be all right for another week." Patrick said with excitement, looking quite worried. Judith faced him, hands on hips, "Patrick," she said with great dislike, "it's all organized." What's the best title for the passage?

Question 204/400:
If two scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory are correct, people will still be driving gasoline powered cars 50 years from now, giving out heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere--and yet that carbon dioxide will not contribute to global warming. In a proposal by two scientists, vehicle emissions   would no longer contribute to global warming. The scientists, F. Jeffrey Martin and William L. Kubic Jr., are proposing a concept, which they have named Green Freedom, for removing carbon dioxide from the air and turning it back into gasoline. The idea is simple. Air would be blown over a liquid solution of potassium carbonate, which would absorb the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide would then be put to chemical reactions that would turn it into fuel : gasoline or jet fuel. This process could change carbon dioxide from an unwanted, climate-changing pollutant into a vast resource for renewable fuels. The cycle--equal amounts of carbon dioxide produced and removed--would mean that cars, trucks and airplanes using the synthetic   fuels would no longer be contributing to global warming. Although they have not yet built a synthetic fuel factory, or even a small model, the scientists say it is all based on existing technology. "Everything in the concept has been built, is operating or has a close cousin that is operating." Dr. Martin said. The Los Alamos proposal does not go against any laws of physics, and other scientists who have independently suggested similar ideas. Dr. Martin said he and Dr. Kubic had worked out their concept in more detail than former proposals. There is, however, a major fact that explains why no one has built a carbon-dioxide-to-gasoline factory: it requires a great deal of energy. According to their analysis, their concept, which would cost about $5 billion to build, could produce gasoline at an operating cost of $1.40 a gallon and would turn economically practical when the price at the pump hits $4.60 a gallon. Other scientists said the Los Alamos proposal perhaps looked promising but could not evaluate it fully because the details has not been published. "It's definitely worth pursuing," said Martin I. Hoffert, a professor of physics at New York University. "It's not that new an idea. It has a couple of pieces to it that are interesting." What is the concept of Green Freedom?
----------
  A: Removing the emission of carbon dioxide.
  B: Reducing the carbon dioxide produced by car driving.
  C: Recycling the carbon dioxide into gasoline.
  D: Reserving the carbon dioxide for global warming.

Question 205/400:
My name is Hua Fei and I am a sporting robot of the 23rdcentury. I am an expert at high flying exercises. I jump from spaceships and as I fall I turn, dive circle and dance until I softly land as close as I can to the finishing line. Robot competitions in the 23rdcentury are truly a popular sport. Fans from all overprefix = st1 /Chinawatch their handheld TVs when a competition comes on. Last time I took part in the 78thOlympics on a flying island aboveBrusselsin the sky. I won the silver medal for my performance. This year I had the honour to be chosen again. I wanted to meet robots from other countries and explore ideas about sport. However, my programmer fell ill the week before we were going to leave. It was very painful for her and I felt very frightened. I no longer felt so confident that I would win. The day of the competition was rather cold for my legs and my special oil began to freeze. I paused before I jumped from the starting place on a little spaceship but then I began my performance. At the correct moment I tried to open my parachute but there was a problem. It only opened a little. Instead of flying softly to earth I began to fall faster and faster so that I could not turn, dive, circle or dance. My heart stopped beating as I landed heavily on a mountain covered with snow. This is why I am writing to you from my hospital bed with two broken legs and a fragile   head. I did not win anything at the Olympics after all. I need the factory to build me two new legs and an even bigger head. Then I will be able to compete once more. Let's hope for greater success in the next Olympics! The reason why Hua Fei failed to perform well this year is that_.
----------
  A: he didn't do it in the right way
  B: he couldn't open his parachute
  C: he didn't replace the batteries
  D: he was affected by a wrong programme

Question 208/400:
My wife and I used to feel that it was impossible to be a true friend to someone whose name we didn't know. How wrong we were! Years of Sunday-morning bus trips through the city with the same group of "nameless" people have changed our thinking. Before the bus takes off, we all join in a conversation: where's the silent woman who sits up front and never responds to our cheery greetings? Here she comes. Her worn clothing suggests she doesn't have much money to spare, but she always takes an extra cup of coffee for the driver. We get smiles from a Mexican couple as they get on the bus hand in hand. When they get off, they're still holding hands. The woman was pregnant late last year, and one day her change of shape confirmed that she'd delivered the child. We even felt a little pride at the thought of our extended family. For many months, our only sadness lay in our inability to _ the same friendship with the silent woman at the front of the bus. Then, one evening, we went to a fish restaurant. We were shown to a table alongside someone sitting alone. It was the woman from the bus. We greeted her with friendly familiarity we'd shown all year, but this time her face softened, then a shy smile. When she spoke, the words escaped awkwardly from her lips. All at once we realized why she hadn't spoken to us before. Talking was hard for her. Over dinner; we learned the stay of a single mother with a disabled son who was receiving special care away from home. She missed him desperately, she explained. "I love him... and he loves me, even though he doesn't express it very well," she murmured. "Lots of us have that problem, don't we? We don't say what we want to say, what we should be saying. And that's not good enough."The candles flared on our tables. Our fish had never tasted better. But the atmosphere grew pleasant, and when we parted as friends--we shared names. All the following statements can describe the woman except   _  .
----------
  A: poor
  B: warm -hearted
  C: silent

Never argue with one's own understanding. The whisper of intelligence is always there, whatever you do. If you create a time lag   between the whisper of intelligence and understanding in you and your action, then you are preventing the brain from growing into a new size. When you argue with intelligence, when you postpone acting according to understanding then there is confusion, the brain gets confused. The voice of understanding, the voice of intelligence has insecurity about it. How do you know that it is the right thing? So we tend to ignore it. Instead we accept authority. We obey. But the brain cannot be orderly, competent, accurate and precise if you do not listen to it, if you have no respect. We are so busy with the outside world and its force that the world that is inside us does not command that respect and reverence  , that care and concern from us. So one has to be a disciple   of one's own understanding, and look upon that understanding as the master. Sometimes one may commit a mistake, it might be the whim   of the ego and we might mistake the whim, the wish of the ego for the voice of silence and intelligence, but that we have to discover. Unless you commit mistakes, how do you learn to discriminate between the false and the true? In learning there is bound to be a little insecurity, a possibility of committing mistakes. Why should one be terribly afraid of committing mistakes? So instead of accepting the authority of habits and conditionings, while one is moving one watches, and when there is a suggestion, do not neglect, ignore, or insult the whisper from within and from one's own intelligence. The whole passage is developed by   _  .

Question 211/400:
Recently, a professor of philosophy   in the United States has written a book called Money and the Meaning of Life. He has discovered that how we deal with money in our daytoday life has more meaning than we usually think. One of the exercises he asked his students to do is to keep record of every penny they spend for a week. From the way they spend their money,they can see what they really value in life. He says our relation with others often becomes clearly defined when money enters the picture. You might have wonderful friendship with somebody and you think that you are very good friends. But you will know him only when you ask him to lend you some money. If he does,it brings something to the relationship that seems stronger than ever before. Or it can suddenly weaken the relationship if he doesn't. This person may say that he has a certain feeling,but if it is not carried out in the money world,there is something less real about it. Since money is so important to us,we consider those who possess a lot of it to be very important. The author interviewed some millionaires   in researching his book. Question:What is the most surprising thing you have discovered about being rich,because you are a selfmade man? Answer:The most surprising thing is how people give me so much respect. I am nothing. I do not know much. All I am is rich. People just have an idea of making more and more money,but what is it for?How much do I need for any given purposes in my life?In his book,the professor uncovered an important need in modern society:To bring back the idea that money is a tool rather than the purpose. Money plays an important role in the material world,but expecting money to bring happiness may be missing the meaning of life. Which of the following might the author disagree with?
----------
  A: Money is important in modern society.
  B: The meaning of life does not completely lie in money.
  C: Wealth will surely bring the owner happiness.
  D: Happiness is not necessarily the result of wealth.

Question 214/400:
Personal computers and the Internet give people new choices about how to spend their time. Some may use this freedom to share less time with certain friends or family members, but new technology will also let them stay in closer touch with those they care most about. I know this from personal experience. E-mail makes it easy to work at home, which is where I now spend most weekends and evenings. My working hours aren't necessarily much shorter than they once were but I spend fewer of them at the office. This lets me share more time with my young daughter than I might have if she'd been born before electronic mail became such a practical tool. The Internet also makes it easy to share thoughts with a group of friends. Say you do something fun see a great movie perhaps-and there are four or five friends who might want to hear about it. If you call each one, you may tire of telling the story. With E-mail, you just write one note about your experience, at your convenience, and address it to all the friends you think might be interested. They can read your message when they have time, and read only as much as they want to. They can reply at their convenience, and you can read what they have to say at your convenience. E-mail is also an inexpensive way stay in close touch with people who live far away. More than a few parents use E-mail to keep in touch, even daily touch, with their children off at college. We just have to keep in mind that computers and the Internet offer another way of staying in touch. They don't take the place of any of the old ways. The use of E-mail has made it possible for the writer to   _  .

Question 215/400:
A young man once went to town and bought himself a pair of trousers. When he got home, he found that they were about two inches longer. He went to the kitchen, there his mother and two sisters were doing housework. He said to them, "The new trousers are too long. Could one of you help me to shorter them by two inches?" But they were too busy. They said nothing and were still working. After his mother finished washing all plates, she shortened the trousers by two inches. Then one of his sisters remember his trousers and shortened them by two inches. When the other sister came back home from cinema, she also remembered the new trousers. "I nearly forgot that." She thought. Then she shortened them by two inches. The new trousers were too   _  .

Question 216/400:
On Friday, June 20th, 29 dogs along with their owners came to Santa Rosa, California. They came there to take part in an unusual competition--one that seeks out and honors the World's Ugliest Dog. Now in its 26th year, the competition is one of the biggest attractions at the annual Sonoma County Fair. Among the leading competitors were Cupcake, who was adopted   from a local dog rescue center in January and Shorty, who would have been put to sleep if its owner, Jason, wasn't kind enough to pick it up. Also competing was 11-year-old veteran Grovie. Described by his owner as short and funny, the Chinese pug is a local resident who has taken part in this contest several times. Then there was 2002 "World's Ugliest Dog" and "Ring of Champions" winner, Rascal. The 7lbs naturally hairless dog with very few teeth comes from an impressive background  . His grandfather, Chi Chi, holds the Guinness World Record for winning the title "World's Ugliest Dog" seven times! But all these impressively "ugly" dogs had no chance against Peanut. The two-year-old dog was badly burnt in a fire which caused him to lose his lips, most of his body hair and eyelids. Besides winning the title, $1,500 USD in cash and a large trophy  , the first time winner also enjoyed an all-expenses-paid trip to New York City where he made scheduled appearances on the Today Show and the Jimmy Kimmel Show. The competition is a great way to honor these dogs, many of whom get their unusual looks because of human abuse  . But most importantly, it raises awareness about their adoption by showing the world that ugliness does not prevent dogs from becoming very loving pets. It can be inferred that Jason adopted Shorty probably because he  _  .
----------
  A: thought Shorty would win the competition
  B: loved Shorty's appearance very much
  C: didn't want Shorty to be homeless

Question 217/400:
"Oh,you must have been a spoiled   kid.You must be really bossy.I wonder what you're going to be like to deal with?" That's often the response Angela Hult gets when people find out she's an only child,she told ABC News.Despite such negative   remarks,Hult has decided to have only one child herself.And she's not alone. According to the US' Office for National Statistics,women approaching the end of their childbearing years had an average of 1.9 children in 2004,compared with 3.1 for their counterparts in 1976.The percentage of onechild families in Britain had risen from 18 percent in 1972 to 26 percent in 2007. But even though only children are becoming increasingly common,the traditional view that they're selfish,spoiled and lack social skills holds strong.Even parents of only children,like Hult,are made to feel guilty about having only one child.Worried that they're being selfish and endangering their child's future,they flock to online discussion forums seeking advice.Soon,however,they ask themselves:is this social prejudice really reasonable? "There have been hundreds and hundreds of research studies that show that only children are no different from their peers  ," Susan Newman,a social psychologist at Rutgers University in the US,told ABC News. This raises another question:why are only children still viewed with such suspicion? "There is a belief that's been around probably since humans first existed that to have just one child is somehow dangerous,both for you and for the continuation of your race," Toni Falbo,a professor of educational psychology,told the Guardian."In the past a lot of children died.You'd have had to be crazy to only have one." Times,of course,have changed and infant mortality   has largely reduced.So what do only children themselves say? Kayley Kravitz,a blogger for The Huffington Post,grew up as an only child and highly recommends the experience."Being an only child taught me the most valuable skill of all:the ability to be alone," she said. What is the common belief since human existed?
----------
  A: The infant death rate always stays high.
  B: People are crazy to have only one child.
  C: It's easy for only children to earn their living.
  D: It's hard to continue the family line with only one child.

Question 218/400:
Few of us haven't read Cinderella, the story of a young woman living in poverty who meets the prince of her dreams. Some might not want to admit it, but there is a hidden Cinderella in everyone's heart--we all wish we could achieve recognition or success after a period of obscurity . Mary Santiago has that secret dream, too. Her story is featured in Another Cinderella Story, a film set in a US high school. Mary is shy but loves to dance. Compared with other girls, she is invisible. However, her world changes completely when a famous teenager pop singer, Joey Parker, appears. Joey is everything the rest of the boys in her class are not--kind, handsome and desirable. Mary and Joey's paths cross at a ball. They meet and fall in love with each other. But when Mary has to rush back home, she leaves behind her MP3 player, which becomes the only clue Joey has to find the girl of his dreams. Of course, there is a wicked  stepmother, who turns out to be Dominique Blatt and she takes in Mary after her dancer mother dies. Dominique treats Mary like a maid and does everything she can to make sure Mary doesn't get into the top dance school. Her two daughters are equally determined to stop Joey falling for Mary, even if that means embarrassing her. The story, though it mostly follows Cinderella, does add a few modern day twists to the classic fairy tale. Refreshingly, the film, unlike many high school films, does not focus on looks, although the actors are all beautiful. There is also a lot less materialism in Another Cinderella Story than in many similar movies. "The movie takes the Cinderella fairytale as its jumping off point," writes movie critic Amber Wilkinson. "The focus is firmly on following your dream." In the movie, Mary Santiago is the main character who   _  .

  A: is brave in expressing her love
  B: is attended badly by the stepmother

Question 219/400:
Happiness is like a stone dropped into a pool to set in motion an ever-widening circle of ripples . As Stevenson has said, being happy is a duty. There is no exact definition of the world happiness. Happy people are happy for all sorts of reasons. They key is not wealth or physical well--being, since we find beggars, patients and so-called failures who are extremely happy. Being happy is a sort of unexpected dividend . But staying happy is an achievement, a victory of soul and character. It is not selfish to struggle for it. It is, indeed, a duty to ourselves and others.  Being unhappy is like an infectious disease; it causes people to stay away from the fufferer. He soon finds himself alone, miserable and upset. There is, however, a cure so simple as to seem, at first glance, ridiculous: If you don't feel happy, pretend to be! It works. Before long you will find that instead of repelling people, you attract them. You discover how deeply rewarding it is to be the center of wider and wider circles of good will. Then the  _ becomes a reality. You possess the secret of peace of mind, and can forget yourself in being of service to others. Being happy, once it is realized as a duty and established as habit, opens doors into unimaginable gardens crowded with grateful friends. We can learn from the passage that_.
----------
  A: everyone has the same happiness and different unhappiness
  B: people generally try to keep away from those who are always unhappy
  C: people who are rich and healthy are surely happy
  D: being happy is the key to success in your work

Question 220/400:
Any diet on which you eat fewer calories than you need to get through the day -- like an 800-calorie-per-day diet can be dangerous. Diets that don't allow any fat also can be bad for you. Everyone needs a certain amount of fat in their diet -- up to 30% of total calories -- so no one should eat a completely fat-free diet. Don't have diets that restrict  certain food groups, either. A diet that requires you to say no to bread or pasta or allows you to eat only fruit is unhealthy. You won't get the vitamins and minerals you need. And although you may lose weight, you'll probably gain it back as soon as you start eating normally again. Some people start dieting because they think all the problems in their lives are because of weight. Others have an area of their lives that they can't control, like an alcoholic parent, so they focus on something they can control -- their exercise and food intake. People who diet may get lots of praise from friends and family when they start losing pounds, which makes them feel good. But eventually a person reaches a weight level -- and doesn't lose as much weight as before because the body is trying to keep a healthy weight, so they aren't any happier. Some people may find it hard to control their eating, so they stick with  _ for a little while, but then eat tons of food. Feeling guilty about the binge, they use laxatives . Eating too little to maintain a healthy weight or eating only to throw up the calories are both eating disorders, which are harmful to a person's health. Which is not the result of restricting certain food groups?
----------
  A: lose weight for a short period
  B: unhealthy
  C: short of nutrition
  D: hungry

Question 222/400:
Shopping used to mean actually going to shops, but nowadays, you can shop without even leaving your house. Just sit in front of your computer, click your mouse and your things will be sent to your house in a couple of days. November 11this a big day for people who like shopping online. On that day last year, many online stores offered a big discount and free delivery service. The biggest online shopping sites in China,Taobao.com and Tmall.com ,sold things worth 19.1 billion yuan in total. "Goods online are often much cheaper. It also saves me a lot of time. And we often have more goods on many online stores than in shopping malls," Wang Xin, an online shopping lover in Beijing, said to China Daily. She stayed up very late for a lot of cheap goods online. She spent several thousand that day. Another big advantage of online shopping is that it helps people get things from different cities, even different countries, _ . "I like eating duck neck very much and I often buy it on Taobao from shops in Wuhan. It's much more delicious than what our local   stores sell, but cheaper," said Zang Xin, a girl in Yangzhou. While enjoying online shopping, many people also have worries, especially for middle school student buyers. Young students are easily attracted by advertisements on the Internet and buy things they don't need. "Middle school students should pay more attention to their study. Searching for things wastes their time," said Jing Chunling, an education expert. "Besides, online shop owners have no idea of the ages of their buyers. Anyone can easily buy things that they want to. Some of goods are even bad for young students such as cigarettes and wine." The article is mainly about   _  .

Question 223/400:
Iceland is a popular European tourist destination. Before you go there, it is good to learn some of the basic Iceland customs first. Just like other countries in Europe, it is one of the customs in Iceland to shake hands and say "Hello". Kissing each other's cheeks is acceptable along with wishing each other a happy day. Another custom is to take off your shoes in the hallway  when you enter someone's home. Also, don't be surprised if someone invites you to their house, since Icelanders love to have guests. Just make sure you take flowers or a similar token of thanks to give them. If you have been invited to eat, keep in mind that you don't need to express thanks before meals like the French or the Japanese. Rather, eat heartily and then thank your host afterwards by shaking his hand. Keep in mind that believing in mysterious beings is part of the tradition in Iceland. Indeed, most of the unique and sometimes strange rock formations in Iceland are due to elves , according to the people of Iceland. Are you planning to spend Christmas in Iceland? If so, make sure you practice saying "Gleileg jol got tog fars!" first, which is the local Christmas greeting. It is part of the tradition in Iceland to have long Christmas holidays--26 days--longer than in any other European country. There are 13 Santa Clauses in Iceland, too! There may not be a law requiring you to follow the customs, but there is no harm in doing so. Following them, you might be rewarded with a rich cultural experience and a more meaningful trip. In the text, the author aims to tell us that   _  .
----------
  A: happiness is a form of courage
  B: when in Rome, do as the Romans do

Question 224/400:
Emilio and Michi spread the colorful tablecloth on the table. They made room for Drew, who was carrying a dish. "Watch out," Drew warned. "This is pretty hot." A moment later, Kent and Alyssa added another hot dish to the table. "That smells so good!" said Michi. "Are most of the parents here yet? I'm hungry." Kent looked through the doors that led into the hallway. "I think Ms. Milano and Mr.Hasselbach just finished giving _ the garden touring. They should be heading into the cafeteria next." The students of Jefferson Middle School in Saint Louis, US had spent all afternoon preparing for the evening meal. They did their best to transform the lunchroom into a beautiful dining area for their families. As the families found their seats, Ms. Milano asked Drew, Emilio, and Michi to join her at the front of the room. She said, "I just wanted to take a moment to congratulate Drew, Emilio and Michi for their wonderful idea. A year ago, they first came to me with the plan for starting a garden at Jefferson. I wondered whether it would work, but they had thought through everything. Any time I had a question about how we would make this work, they had an answer prepared. As you can see, they were absolutely correct. About three-quarters of the food you will be enjoying came from the school garden. The students prepared the entire meal themselves." Ms. Milano handed Drew, Michi and Emilio a box each. They opened their box as Ms. Milano continued. "As a thank-you to these students for their creative idea and hard work, they have each received a stepping stone for the garden. Their names and date appear on the stones." She turned to them. "Students for years to come will be enjoying the garden that you helped create," she said. "We thought it would be appropriate for them to have a reminder of our garden's founders." They held up their stepping stones and smiled as the crowd clapped. "And now," said Ms Milano, "please help yourself to some of the mouthwatering food our young chefs have prepared. Dinner is served!" Why did Ms. Milano give stepping stones to Drew, Michi , and Emilio?
----------
  A: They have good cooking skills.
  B: They are the best students of the school.
  C: They have made the school more beautiful.

Question 225/400:
Halloween is the one night of the year where being scared is supposed to be good fun. However, amid all the harmless activities like trick-or-treating, sometimes genuinely frightening and disturbing things can happen. October 31 has been the date of some horrific murders and unexplained disappearances, which are far more terrifying than any ghosts, goblins, or witches. Because they happened to take place on Halloween, the following mysteries have an extra aura of creepiness to them, and they remain unsolved to this day. 1 Hyun Jong was a 21-year-old South Korean student attending Pennsylvania State University. In 2001, after leaving the Halloween party in a club, she was dropped off at her apartment by her friends at 4:00 AM. This was the last anyone ever saw of her. A search was conducted of her apartment. There was no sign of any struggle, but many of her belongings were there, indicating that she had gone inside after being dropped off. But what happened to her afterward? Although some evidence indicated her death, her body has never been found. 2 On Halloween night in 1977, the parents of 19-month-old Nima Louise Carter placed their child inside her crib. The next morning, Nima's parents were shocked to discover that she was missing. Since the windows were locked, it's theorized that someone must have been hiding in the closet and took the child out of the house while her parents were asleep. The police took it as child abduction. A month later, a group of kids were playing in an abandoned house four blocks away. When they opened up the house's refrigerator, they received a horrifying shock when the body of an infant came tumbling out. The child was identified as Nima Louise Carter, who died of suffocation . 3 Chris Jenkins was a 21-year-old student who visited a bar on Halloween night in 2002. After leaving the bar around midnight, Chris disappeared without a trace. He remained a missing person for four months until his body was discovered in the Mississippi River. Since Chris was still wearing his Halloween costume, all indications were that he died shortly after he disappeared. Since his cause of death was determined to be drowning, authorities initially  believed it was an accident or suicide. His parents refused to believe _ and appealed for a more careful investigation. Finally, in 2006, the death was reclassified as a murder case. 4 Sometime during the early morning Halloween hours of 1981, a Manhattan couple named Ronald Sisman and Elizabeth Platzman were murdered in their apartment. The couple was severely beaten before being shot in the head, execution-style, and the apartment was in a complete mess. Sisman was rumored to be involved in drugs, so authorities initially believed that to be the motive for the killings. However, the case took a turn when a prisoner claimed that one of his fellow inmates  had somehow predicted the crime weeks before it actually happened. The police then questioned the inmate, yet no insightful information was brought out. Whose body was found inside a fridge?
----------
  A: Chris Jenkins
  B: Hyun Jong
  C: Nima Louise Carter
  D: Sisman Platzman

Question 227/400:
The idea for the book Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone came to Joanne Kathleen Rowling in 1990. It took her seven years to finish writing it. During those seven years she had a number of jobs, including one job as an English teacher in Portugal. Rowling sent the book to four publishers before one of them bought it. She was very happy to sell her book because it was her life's dream to be a published writer. Before she sold her book, Rowling was living in a small apartment with her daughter and was so poor that she could not afford heat in the winter. Harry Potter became very successful with children and adults in England. The book also really took off in the United States. After her second and third books were published, the three Harry Potter books filled the top three places on many newspapers' lists of best-sellers. Then the books were made into popular movies. Without question, Rowling's life had completely changed, in just three years. Harry Potter books have now sold more than 30 million books around the world and have been translated into more than thirty-five languages. In 1997, Rowling was earning PS70 (about US$110) a week. By the end of 2001, she had earned over PS150 million ($250 million), making her one of the most successful female writers of all time. Which sentence is true about the first Harry Potter book?
----------
  A: Four publishers bought it.
  B: It took the writer several years to finish it.
  C: It was first published in Portugal.
  D: Rowling got the idea from her daughter.

Question 229/400:
The US government has started a website, Admongo, to help children think critically about the advertising aimed at them. It claims to provide visitors with an "education" through games and other amusement. A cartoon man dressed in old time pilot clothing greets visitors to Admongo. "Call me Haiz", he says upon arrival in a rocket ship that opens up with a crazy world inside it. Spacey dance music plays in the background as Haiz tells visitors that they need to learn about advertising. Its inventors say eight to twelve years old is the age kids develop their critical thinking abilities. Kids that age are also a big market for advertisers. The idea behind Admongo is to teach children three things: To _ the advertiser. To know what the advertiser is really saying. And to know what the advertisement is trying to get the child to do. Children learn these things through a video game. They create their own game character. They can choose different skin colors, hair styles, eye and mouth shapes. Then they begin a trip through ad-land, where there are ads on buses and billboards. The players have to find all the marketing in the neighborhood before they can move on to the next level. The Admongo game takes players inside a home, to the advertising studio and everywhere else ads can be found. It is a complete exploration of the world of marketing. One such area is food marketing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says it is a big business. The FTC estimates that food, drink and fast-food restaurants spent more than one and a half billion dollars on advertising to young people in 2010. The FTC says children are important for three reasons. They buy products. They influence parents and caregivers to buy. And they are the future adult buyers of the products. A recent study says most advertising aimed at children is for foods of the lowest nutritional value. First Lady Michelle Obama has said she would like to see advertisers marketing healthy foods for children. What is the best title of the text?
----------
  A: The guide of Admongo
  B: An education website for children
  C: A popular online video game
  D: A website aimed at children

Question 230/400:
When you walk into the small Australian town of Coober Pedy, you may be surprised by what you can see. It's just barren   land there! So why even call it a town? There are more than 4,000 people of 48 nationalities. However, all of the people live underground! Coober Pedy was established  in 1915, following the discovery of opals  . The town is sometimes called the "opal capital of the world," because it is the largest opal mining area in the world. Due to a desert climate  , people came to realize that while working under the ground was easy, living above it was not. The solution was to move underground, by changing old mines into homes and establishing the world's first and most likely, only underground town. As years have gone by, the homes have become bigger. There are now also some hotels for tourists. They come from all over the world just to see this unusual town. Coober Pedy is probably best known for its unique style  of underground living. While the structures  may be located underground, they are in no way worse than those that lie above. Not only do their walls have the color of beautiful red, but also the structures have all the modern equipment like walk-in closets, modern kitchens and televisions. And the town also has gift shops selling opal jewelry, a couple of museums and even a church! Besides, Coober Pedy is also a favourite among filmmakers. And it has appeared in a series of movies such as Pitch Black, Red Planet and Opal Dream. The best title for this passage might be    _      .

  A: Opal Mining in Australia
  B: The Desert Climate in Coober Pedy

Question 234/400:
What's your opinion about gun control in the US? Figures tell a different story: Countries that allow their citizens to carry guns seem to have more killings than those that do not allow them. It's easy to kill with a gun. The media is filled with violence. People, especially young people, watch television. Having a gun does not cause someone to kill. The problem is within that person's mind. Controlling guns will not control killing. Changing the mindset will, however. --- Bobby Walker, U.S. Guns are deadly to all others who are near or know someone who has one. People don't understand the danger it holds, and don't realize what will happen just by cleaning it of if a younger child gets a hold of it. This weapon  is dangerous and we don't need teens, kids, anyone to have them. Society can get along without guns. ---Ann Miller, U.S I have a very large farm near Austin, Texas, USA. Because it is far from the city, I need to protect my property  and cattle from thieves and wild dogs. The wildlife, such as coyotes and puma , can feed on deer, mice, rabbits--they don't bother me and I don't bother them. I lost 45 animals to thieves that cut a fence. This will never happen again. You ask if I would shoot--of course--that's why I carry a gun. --- Texas Rancher, U.S Some people think guns are very bad because they lead to violence. In my opinion, when people kill themselves or others, they do not have any feelings because they do not know anything about love, sympathy , and promise. The only way those persons can get these feelings is when they keep close to family, friends and people who matter to them. Now, having a gun is not a problem: the problem is what the people feel when they use one. ---Connie Faille, Colombia Bobby Walker's attitude towards the media might be   _

Question 235/400:
When my father was getting ready for work, our house was ruled by knocks and words. He used to come downstairs to breakfast. The morning paper lay beside his plate. He always read the "Deaths" first, and then he knocked once on the table. One of my sisters brought his toast ,already buttered for him. Usually he said nothing, but once I heard him say, "I love you very much, Edith. I would love you more if you buttered my toast on both sides." He read the paper all through breakfast. Two knocks on the table meant "I am ready for my tea." If a single knock followed, that meant "More toast, please."  After breakfast he said, "Boots." The paper was spread  for him over the back of an armchair. Yesterday's paper was put on the chair for his feet, and his boots were brought to him, freshly cleaned. He read standing, at the same time putting on his boots.  With one boot finished, he said, "Bus." At that point one of the girls went outside to the garden gate and waited there. Her job was to stop the bus when it came. It came early sometimes, and it had to wait for my father. "Overcoat, hat." One of my sisters had already brushed his overcoat. Now she held it open for him and guided his arms into it. Another girl came with his hat, nicely brushed. "Handkerchief, pipe ." They were brought and put, with his tobacco , into his pockets.  He looked out of the window and said either "Walking stick" or "Umbrella". It was handed to him. Ready now, he was still reading the paper. He did not put it down until he heard the shout "Bus coming!" Then he kissed my mother and went out. The girls breathed freely.  How lucky a man is to have a wife and five daughters at home! What was the father's favorite?
----------
  A: Reading newspaper.
  B: Having bread buttered on both sides.

Question 237/400:
As a young adult, Noah Webster was a teacher. At this time, the colonies were fighting for independence from Britain. Yet the books that American children used in school all came from Britain. The books were all about British people and British places. Webster wanted books that would mean more to American children. So he wrote three books that used American examples -- a grammar book, a spelling book, and a reader. These books were very popular, and millions of them were sold. Webster was interested in changing the spellings of words. He wanted words to be spelled the way they were pronounced. For example, he thought the word "head" should be spelled "hed", and the word "laugh" should be spelled "laf". People liked Webster's suggestions. However, few words were actually changed. One group of words that were changed were words in which an unpronounced "u" followed an "o". That is why Americans write "color" and "labor", and the British write "colour" and "labour". With the money he made from his books, Webster was able to write. It was the first American English dictionary, published in 1828. Webster's dictionary had over 70000 words and gave the meaning and origin of each. To this day, Webster's work is the example that most dictionaries of American English follow. The last sentence of this passage means   _  .
----------
  A: most dictionaries in the world are the copies of Webster's
  B: most dictionaries in American English have the characteristics of Webster's
  C: most American people followed Webster's advice on writing
  D: Webster's dictionary is the only one used in the United States

Question 239/400:
I love to tell the story about how I met my best friend---- Tiger. We met at the school fair. Each year, all the fourth-grade classes hold a school fair. Everyone in the fourth-grade works at the fair. Some sell ice cream, drinks and snacks. Others take care of the little children who ride the rides. I got the second job and I've never regretted it, because that's where I met Tiger. My job was to help little children get on the back of a little horse. I kept telling the children to wait their turn and holding ice cream for them while they rode about. One thing was clear to me. I was growing older and should be more responsible. Suddenly, a boy came to the horse. He took the little horse's reins! The horse stopped, and the girl on its back started to fall. I was trying to reach the girl when I saw Tiger go by my legs. It held the horse's reins and pulled the horse away from my legs. I caught the girl just before we both hit the ground. The girl sat on top of me. She was laughing at the ice cream on my face. The horse's reins were in Tiger's mouth! Thanks to Tiger's fast action, I saved the little girl. We were both heroes. And Tiger, the fastest dog I've even known became my new best friend. The writer's job was to   _  .

Question 240/400:
Poor weather. Technical difficulties. These are some of the typical causes of cancelled trains and planes. But sometimes, the excuse can be a lot more _ . Just recently, passengers waiting for a train to Peterborough heard the following announcement, "For reasons beyond our control, we regret to inform passengers that the 13:46 Train to Peterborough has been cancelled. The next train will be arriving on Platform in approximately 36 minutes." Oh, well, another delayed train, thought most passengers. But a couple of them decided to enquire further. Incredibly, they were informed that the real reason for the non-arrival of the train was that the driver refused to do his job because his seat was wet. "A wet seat? That's got to be a joke," said one passenger angrily. "I wouldn't normally complain if the train is just a bit delayed, but this was unbelievable, " he added. "What really made me angry is that this driver refused to get in the train," said another passenger. "He probably went off for a cup of tea after that!" she added. A spokesperson for the rail company apologized for the incident, but said the driver couldn't sit on the damp seat, and wouldn't be able to drive the train standing up. The spokesperson went on to explain that the seat had become wet after water entered through an open window when the train was being cleaned in a "train wash" In another transport-related incident, a flight from Chicago to Frankfurt made an emergency landing in Canada after the pilot spilled his coffee. Apparently, the spilt liquid caused the plane's radio to send out "transponder code 7500", which is used to inform ground control that there's been a hi-jacking  . After landing in Toronto, the 255 passengers crew members were put up in a hotel for the night, then flown on to Frankfurt the following afternoon. "What a disgusting trip!" said one tired passenger after the painful experience had ended. So, does your job have the potential to cause such disorder? Which of the following is the best title of the passage?
----------
  A: Wet seat, Canceled Train!
  B: Spilled Coffee, Emergency Landing!
  C: Small Incident, Big Disruptions!
  D: Innocent Driver, Angry Passengers!

Question 241/400:
Money Matters for Students GETTING A GRANT  Who pays? The local education authority (LEA) for the area in which the student is living. Who can get this money? Anyone who gets a place on a first degree course,although a student who has already attended a course of advanced further education may not.Students must also have been resident in the UK for at least three years,which can exclude   some students from overseas. SPECIAL CASES If a student has worked before going to college: A student who is 26 or more before the course starts and who has worked for at least three of the previous six years will get extra money--PS 155 a year if 26,increasing to a maximum of PS 615 at 29 or more. If a student is handicapped: LEAs will give up to PS 500 to help meet extra expenses--such as buying a tape recorder for a blind student,extra heating or special food. Banking: Most of the big banks offer special services to students who open accounts (in the hope that they will stay with the bank when they become rich officials).A student won't usually have to pay bank charges as long as the account stays in credit.Some banks allow students to overdraw by PS 100 or so,and still don't make charges (though they  do charge interest). A student who cannot walk has to buy a wheelchair costing PS 750 to go to classes.How much of the cost will he have to pay himself?
----------
  A: PS 150.
  B: PS 250.
  C: PS 500.
  D: PS 750.

Question 242/400:
My parents always raised me to have strong values and hold firm to my confidence in life, and this was never more proved than when a situation arose when it would be easy for most people to ignore it. A gentleman at my father's work smelled awful and neglected his behavior, and as the months went by, he showed signs of confusion. After being told to pick up papers at another building, he would be found sitting at his desk staring at his shoes; after being reminded (to which he would completely believe he hadn't been told the first time), he would be found once again sitting at his desk in the same position. This happened to worsening degrees over a few months and his coworkers either ignored it or were ignorant to this due to a lack of social association with the man. My father began to mentally record all of this and finally sat down with him one day when he was found two hours after work was out, sitting in his car, looking like he didn't know where to go. Apparently the gentleman was in the beginning/middle stages of Alzheimer's and there was someone who used his forgetfulness as a reason to ask him for money every few days. My father took this man to a hospital (for the first time in years) to be properly treated, and then got a caretaker to watch over his condition. He then went to the man's house and helped him sort out all of his financial matters and get his retirement set up; they went to the bank and had a government worker ensure that his bills would be paid for and his children would no longer get to treat him like a personal ATM. That my father took his much personal time to help another man that so many had forgotten or would choose to neglect, or even make fun of, truly shows his character. The author presents this passage by   _  .
----------
  A: telling an instructive story
  B: describing his father

Question 243/400:
I'm a teacher. But there are days, like today, when I wonder why. The results of an English quiz taken by my fifth-graders were depressing. Despite my best efforts, the world of pronouns remains a mystery to them. How I wish there were a way to make the study of our language as exciting as a computer game, so the glazed   looks would not appear in their eyes at the mention of the word "grammar." I remember my husband's words: "Why don't you quit? You'd probably make more money by doing something else, and you wouldn't have papers to grade every night." Tonight I have a stack of papers to grade, which I promised my students I would return tomorrow. But a friend, whom I haven't seen in a year, is visiting from Belgium, and I told her I would keep this evening free. Sitting in traffic behind a distant stoplight, it's hard not to replay the day. A voice reports the body of a local youngster, missing for weeks, has been identified. This missing child has had a deep effect on my students. They wondered, "If it happened to her, could it happen to me?" My children had found the answer themselves. They got out their pencils, markers and made cards. Cards were written with words of compassion and love for a mother and father they didn't know. Cards were filled with red hearts, golden crosses, flowers and angels. Their cards, intended to comfort others, comforted the children themselves by leading them past the anxiety, back into the world of security   that should be theirs. And then I remember why I'm still teaching. It's the children. They're more important than a lifetime filled with quiet evenings and more valuable than a pocket filled with money. My classroom, a child-filled world of discovery, of kindness and of caring is the real world. It's time to call my friend. I have promises to keep. She'll understand. After all, she's a teacher. The students' attitude to the missing child's parents might be that of   _  .

Question 245/400:
The personal computer has overtaken the family dog as man's best friend.according to a study. Researchers found that just 6 per cent of us believe that" most people rely more on their dog than they do on their PC",while 67 per cent think the opposite to be true. Even 38 per cent of dog owners admitted to relying more on their PC than on their dog, although 36 per cent disagreed. And 71 per cent of 18 to 24-year-old dog owners said they relied more on their computer. Paul Allen,editor of Computeractive magazine said:"These days you can even you're your PC for fl walk,provided you have a laptop or tablet." "It's only a matter of time until the first PC that fetches your slippers." Researchers questioned 2,000 British adults to find out the change modern technology has brought to their home life. They found that male dog owners are almost twice as likely as female owners to rely on their computer than a _ companion. Mr.Allen said:"With broadband bringing them global news and newspaper sales falling,the family dog even misses out on the pleasure of taking the paper to his owner." But it's not all bad news for obedient dogs. "The family PC has given dog owners access to a wealth of resources and information that can help with the long-term care that a dog needs,"Mr.Allen said. According to Mr. Allen,the personal computer
----------
  A: won't have effect on newspaper sales
  B: can't help people take better care of the dog
  C: will drive the dog as a pet out completely

Question 247/400:
"The price of books for our students is just getting higher and higher and,combined with the rising cost of tuition,it's killing these students,"said Peter Jason,a college professor."Remember,students are one of the poorest groups of people in America.Almost half of them have at least one part-time job.In fact,one of my students has three jobs.And she still manages to have high scores and go to school full-time." Textbook prices are traditionally high.Adding to that problem,many college teachers change textbooks year after year;they either upgrade to a new edition or switch to an entirely different textbook.This further hurts students because if an instructor no longer uses a particular textbook,that book has no resale value. Dr.Jason decided to make lire a little easier and a lot cheaper for his students by writing his own book on public speaking."Many books have an increased price because of CD-ROMs,lots of color photographs and pictures.I talked to my students,and many of them,like me,prefer to keep things simple! So,a few years ago,I wrote my own textbook.Compared to most other public speaking books,mine is half the number of pages,and one-third the price.That is,$30 instead of $90.When I wrote a second edition last year,students only had to buy the 35 new pages, For only $7.00,they had almost a new book. Now my loose-leaf textbook enjoys great popularity among the students.Maybe in the future more writers and publishers will try it." What did Dr. Jason say about students at college?
----------
  A: They are short of money.
  B: They need better textbooks
  C: They should do part-time jobs.
  D: They are trying to get high scores.

Question 248/400:
A few minutes before six o'clock, Mr. Smith decided to leave. He was about to start the car when a gunman jumped up from the back seat. He held a gun to Mr. Smith's head. "Drive me to Paris!" he shouted. "All right", Mr. Smith answered. He started the engine, pulled away from the side of the street and drove down. Being eighty-one years old, he knew he could not fight the gunman. He knew he needed help. Where were the police? As he drove through a crossing, he looked up and down the side streets, hoping to meet a police car. But he could see nothing. "Just my luck," he thought, "If I was driving too fast, there would be a police car on every corner." Suddenly he pushed his foot down on the accelerator , and the car ran much faster. "What are you doing?" shouted the gunman. "Keeping off the police," Mr. Smith answered. "I thought I saw a police car back there." He ran lights, drove the wrong way on one-way streets. On two-way streets he drove on the wrong side of the road. Not one policeman saw him. Again Mr. Smith's plan was not working. He had to try a new plan. He turned a corner and saw the police station in front. Then he drove his car as fast as he could towards the police gate. The car hit a police motorbike down and stopped. Mr. Smith shouted, "Help! Help!" Then he reached back to grab  the man's gun. At the same time the policeman heard the noise and quickly caught the gunman. From the passage, what can we infer ?
----------
  A: Mr. Smith is a strong man.
  B: Mr. Smith is a shy man.
  C: Mr. Smith is a wise man.
  D: Mr. Smith is a stupid man.

Question 249/400:
A clinic in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, works to support the health of people and forests. Kinari Webb is an American doctor who helped start the non-profit group that operates the clinic. The group is known as ASRI. Dr. Webb says most communities value the local forests, but illegal logging  was often their only way to earn money to pay for health care. "Villagers know that if they protect the forest, that's good for their long-term well-being. But if they have no money to see a doctor, they have to do illegal logging," said Dr. Webb. The clinic is in Sukadana, a village outside Gunung Palung National Park. Each month someone from ASRI visits the surrounding villages to see if they are actively logging or burning land within the park. Communities that do not take part in illegal logging pay about 40 percent less for health care than those that do. Also, the clinic uses a barter system. Patients can pay with things like handmade baskets, labor exchanges, young trees or fruit they grow. Patients learn about environmental conservation as they wait to register at the clinic. Many of the 70 staff members also help communities learn about organic farming and other ways to earn money. In May, ASRI started a program to identify forest "guardians". These guardians work with the community to try to prevent illegal logging. One of the guardians says he entered the program because ASRI helped his son recover from tuberculosis . The clinic is small, but very busy. However, people did not trust the clinic at first. They wanted to go to the only hospital in the area. Yet its resources are limited and villagers often have to travel more than two hours to get there. Now, people happily share stories about the clinic. Amelia's mother is one of them. She started going there when her daughter was eight months old. She says the treatment is good. Dr. Webb smiled when she heard that. Dr. Webb said: "Health care is an incredible key. And everyone everywhere around knows that we really care and that we are helping save their lives." We can infer that  _  .
----------
  A: only a few people went to the clinic at the beginning
  B: the clinic is well equipped
  C: Amelia's mother is not satisfied with the medical service
  D: the only hospital in the area is of poor service

Question 250/400:
There was a time in my life when beauty meant something special to me. I guess that would have been when I was about six or seven years old, just several weeks or maybe a month before the orphanage  turned me into an old man.       I would get up every morning at the orphanage, make my bed just like the little soldier that I had become and then I would get into one of the two straight lines and march to breakfast with the other twenty or thirty boys who also lived in my dormitory.       After breakfast one Saturday morning I returned to the dormitory and saw the house parent chasing the beautiful monarch butterflies who lived by the hundreds in the bushes scattered around the orphanage.       I carefully watched as he caught these beautiful creatures, one after another, and then took them from the net and then stuck straight pins through their head and wings, pinning them onto a heavy cardboard sheet.       How cruel it was to kill something of such beauty. I had walked many times out into the bushes, all by myself, just so the butterflies could land on my head, face and hands so I could look at them up close.       When the telephone rang the house parent laid the large cardboard paper down on the back cement step and went inside to answer the phone. I walked up to the cardboard and looked at the one butterfly who he had just pinned to the large paper. It was still moving about so I reached down and touched it on the wing causing one of the pins to fall out. It started flying around and around trying to get away but it was still pinned by the one wing with the other straight pin. Finally its wing broke off and the butterfly fell to the ground and just trembled.       I picked up the torn wing and the butterfly and I spat on its wing and tried to get it to stick back on so it could fly away and be free before the house parent came back. But it would not stay on him. What is the author's attitude towards the house parent's pinning some butterflies on the cardboard?
----------
  A: tolerant
  B: unconcerned
  C: disgusted

Question 252/400:
Air pollution levels were literally off the charts  in Beijing over the weekend, reportedly reducing visibility  to about 100 yards in some areas. The air has been classified hazardous to human health for many days, at its worst hitting pollution levels 25 times that considered safe in the U. S. The entire city is blanketed  in a thick grey smog, leading to official warnings to stay inside. At least four deaths have been blamed on what Chinese media calls the "smoggy weather"--including two high school students who were hit by a train due to low visibility. The smog has affected more than 30 cities in China. The air quality is so bad--some foreigners in China have been referring to it on social media as the "Airpocalypse "--that government media have been joining Internet users in questioning China's rapid path to economic growth. Unusually, the pollution is getting headline treatment on local news bulletins and in the domestic  media. Since the beginning of the year, the government has been releasing hourly pollution readings for 74 Chinese cities, almost half of which are now showing severe pollution. In the Chinese media, there's been some soul-searching  about why the problem has been so serious. The China Daily took the country's rapid urbanization  process to task , commenting in an editorial, "The air quality in big cities could have been better had more attention been paid to the density  of high rises, had more trees been planted in proportion  to the number of residential areas, and had the number of cars been strictly controlled." Meanwhile, the Global Tunes has been pointing out China's role as the global factory and the "biggest construction site in the world." The Los Angeles Times reports fuel, standards in China allow for three times the amount of poisonous sulfur  as in the United States, and five times as much compared to European standards. The passage is mainly dealing with
----------
  A: the smoggy weather in Beijing
  B: the severe air pollution in China
  C: China's economic growth and pollution
  D: Chinese government media's attitudes toward air pollution

Question 254/400:
It has been found that less than one shopper in five makes a complete shopping list before going to the store. The reason for this is that seven out of ten of today's purchases  are decided in the store, where the shoppers tend toward impulse  buying. Buying groceries on impulse had risen for the past forty years, and this rise has coincided  with the growth of self-service shopping. However, in grocery stores where clerks wait on customers there is much less impulse buying. It is hard for people to buy on impulse if they have to address a clerk. Psychologists have joined forces with merchandising  experts. It is their job to persuade people to buy products which they may not need or even want until they see them attractively presented. It was discovered by the psychologists that shoppers want help in their purchases. Having so many choices confuses them, and they prefer the package that attracts them. Therefore, it is now more usual for food packers to pay attention to their package design. Attraction depends heavily on the position of the product on the shelf, however. Thus, persuading the shopper to buy is easier if the product is located at eye-level. The reason for the above mentioned phenomenon is that   _  .
----------
  A: people have difficulty making up their mind before going shopping
  B: people don't know what is available in the store
  C: people tend to decide on buying products when they see them
  D: people are easily deceived  by the attractive products

Question 255/400:
The weather was terrible that night.The summer thunderstorm had knocked out the power.Luckily,there was enough candlelight flickering on the kitchen table.With the  candlelight,I could see the card I was writing to my husband's cousins in Finland. Dear Heli and Risto, You are on my mind tonight because we are using the candles you gave us when you visited us two years ago.There was a horrible summer thunderstorm this evening and the power went out,and your candles were just what we needed.They have lit our dinnertime,the bedrooms and now I am sitting by one in the kitchen... What I didn't say to Heli and Risto is that we never burned the candles before because they,well,smell like a campfire.And so they stood in iron candlesticks until we needed them. I'm so thankful that we had candles on hand that dark night.And I'm equally as thankful that I had a beautiful card on hand,too,or I would have let the opportunity to keep in touch with faraway family escape.It would have turned into another one of those moments when the thought of sending a card crossed my mind but never actually happened. The candle burned slowly.After I finished my card to Finland,I enjoyed looking through the rest of my "Someone Cares" greeting cards.The air was fresh and cool,and I had cards and enough light to write.I found a birthday card for my nephew's 10th birthday,a thinkingofyou card for my aunt,and a fun greeting card for an old friend and I began writing.Candles and cards--two things that make a thunderstorm into the perfect storm. Why did the writer light the two candles that night?
----------
  A: Because she thought of her husband's cousins.
  B: Because she wanted to add some fun to her life.
  C: Because she wanted to enjoy another kind of lifestyle.
  D: Because there was no electricity due to the thunderstorm.

Question 256/400:
Jeri Solomon is a morning person but Jim, her husband of 11 years, is not. Early in their life, it caused a problem. "When we were planning our wedding, I wanted to have these big discussions at 8 a. m.,when I had been up for two hours and was fresh, but Jim would just be getting out of bed," says the 46-year-old designer from Melrose, Mass. "We ended up getting into many arguments because I thought he had no interest, when really he was just still half-asleep." The couple learned to work around their differences over the years, but their situation isn't uncommon, says Katherine Sharkey, professor at BrownUniversity. "More women tend to be larks, while men are like night owls ," she says. The question is:Why? The answer lies in each person's body clock. "The body clock is about 24 hours, thanks to Earth's 24-hour light-dark cycle," Sharkey says. "But some people have a longer natural cycle, and some are shorter." If yours is on the long side, you're more likely to be a night owl. If it runs short, you're probably an early riser. But your body clock can change over your lifetime. There's a developmental piece-school-age children are generally early birds, while teenagers tend to be night owls, and then as they age, adults gradually turn back into morning people," Sharkey says. Besides the clear problems with being a night owl if you have fl day job, "night owls tend to be more low-spirited, and have a higher dependence on coffee," Sharkey says. But the news isn't all bad. A recent study in Belgium found that night owls can stay more focused as the day goes on, compared with early risers. Morning people, however, also have advantages. "Larks generally sleep better, have more regular sleep, and have more flexible characters," Sharkey says. They also tend to be happier and feel healthier than night owls, according to a recent study from the University of Toronto. Compared with morning people, night owls   _  .
----------
  A: work more flexibly
  B: feel happy more easily
  C: sleep more soundly at night

Question 257/400:
There is a famous story about British poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He was writing a poem when he was interrupted by a knock at the door. This was an age before telephones. Someone was delivering a message. When Coleridge got back to his poem, he had lost his inspiration. His poetic mood had been broken by the knock on his door. His unfinished poem, which could otherwise have been a masterpiece, would now never be more than a fragment. This story tells how unexpected communication can destroy an important thought, which bring us to the cellphone. The most common complaint about cellphones is that people talk on them to the annoyance of people around them. But more damaging may be the cellphone's interruption of our thoughts. We have already entered a golden age of little white lies about our cellphones, and this is by and large a healthy, protective development. "I didn't hear it ring" or "I didn't realize my phone had shut off" are among the lies we tell to give ourselves space where we're beyond reach. The notion of being unreachable is not a new concept--we have "Do Not Disturb" sign on the doors of hotel rooms. So why must we feel guilty when it comes to cellphones? Why must we apologize if we decide to shut off the phone for a while? Now time alone, or a conversation with someone next to us which cannot be interrupted by a phone, is something to be cherished. Even cellphone devotees , myself usually included, can't help at times wanting to throw their phone away, or curse the day they were invented. But we don't and won't, and there really is no need. All that's required to take back our private time is a general social recognition that we have the right to it. In other words, we have to develop a healthy contempt  for the rings of our own phones. A cellphone call deserves no greater priority  than a random  word from the person next to us,though the call on my cellphone may be the one-in-a-million from Steven Spielberg--who has finally read my novel and wants to make it his next movie. But most likely it is not, and I'm better off thinking about the idea I just had for a new story, or the slice of pizza I'll eat for lunch. According to the author, what is the most annoying problem caused by cellphones?
----------
  A: People get so obsessed  with the cellphone rings that they fail to notice anything else.
  B: People feel guilty when they are not able to answer their cellphones.
  C: Cellphones interrupt people's private time.
  D: With cellphones it is no longer possible to be unreachable.

Question 258/400:
A group of kids at McIntyre Elementary School, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, have created a special bench to make sure their fellow classmates aren't left out on the playground. Called the "Buddy Bench", students can use the seat as a safe and supportive place to let others know they'd like to be included in playtime, but may be too shy to ask. The concept of the Buddy Bench is simple: Students who want to partake in playground games and activities, but may feel hesitant, can take a seat, which signifies  to other children on the playground that they may need something extra to encourage them to participate. The idea for the bench came about last year, when Farrell, school counselor at McIntyre Elementary, was conducting a leadership group to help students overcome shyness and gain confidence. Four fourth-grade students came up with the idea for the Buddy Bench in this workshop, and worked with Farrell to draft a letter to present to the Parent Teacher Staff Organization to make the bench a reality. The PTSO approved the students' proposal, and installed  a bright metal bench with a cheerful sign that reads "Buddy Bench" on the school's playground. Since it was installed on Nov. 16, the bench has been effective. The simple concept has resonated with  the students, and already has created a better environment within the school community. "Each day, I go to see the buddy bench working," Farrell said. "The lessons _ are learning now will benefit them their entire lives. It is simply a beautiful example of kids wanting to be kind and continue to be kind every day." Which of the following statements can show "the bench has been effective"?
----------
  A: The workshop kids have set a good example.
  B: More and more creative ideas have come up.
  C: The PTSO has decided to provide more buddy benches.
  D: Some shy students have found friends on the playground.

Question 259/400:
Kindness and kids just seem to go hand in hand. But 62% of more than 2,600 participants in the NBC News State of Kindness Poll believe that today's kids are less kind than those in the past. Women(66%) feel about this kindness fall more strongly than men(58%). Most of the participants who feel that way(77%) thank parents caused the seeming lack of kindness among today's children, with a few thinking that society, schools, or friends caused it. At the same time, Americans say they don't put kindness first when it comes to teaching kids values. Among all participants, honesty is taught more than kindness as well as other things like courage, leadership and storing work ethic . But the younger generation--those aged 18-24--think highly of kindness rules. They choose kindness by 10% over honesty as the most important quality to teach kids. The question of whether kindness is learned or taught--or somewhere in between --causes different opinions. According to the study, Americans have different opinions on whether kindness in something one is born with or needs to be learned and _ over time. Slightly more than half(52%) of the participants believe that all of us are born with the ability to show kindness, while 48% believe kindness must be developed. Parenthood  makes a difference to your thoughts on the causes of kindness. Those without kids(56%) are more likely to think that people are born to be kind, while 50% of the participants with kids think kindness is developed. Also, 51% of dads and 54% of men with no kids believe kindness is something time is born with. Slightly more than half of the moms say kindness must be learned, while 48% believe it is what one is born with. How many moms in the study believe kindness is what one is born with?

Question 261/400:
There's sweetness in the lies parents tell their kids, which is a very good thing, since they tell a lot of them. The lies -- nearly all of them harmless -- may differ depending on the family. But from culture to culture, there's one tall tale nearly all parents tell, and they tell it repeatedly: "We do not have a favorite child." Mom and Dad will say it seriously. They'll repeat it endlessly, and in many cases, they'll be lying through their teeth. It's one of the worst kept secrets of family life that all parents have a preferred son or daughter, and the rules for acknowledging it are the same everywhere: The favored kids recognize their status and keep quiet about it -- the better to preserve the good thing they've got going and to keep their siblings  off their back. The unfavored kids howl   about it like wounded cats. And on pain of death, the parents deny it all.  The stonewalling is understandable. Most parents want to spare unfavored kids the hurt that the truth could cause. Moreover, the court of public opinion can respond pitilessly -- even furiously -- to moms or dads who speak the forbidden truth. Last March, a mother of two wrote a post on the website Babble.com under the headline I THINK I LOVE MY SON JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE. The mom went on at length describing the greater warmth she feels for her baby boy compared with her baby girl and even included a photo of herself and her unfavored daughter. She was, predictably, severely criticized. "Please work on your issues lady!" said one typical response. "I feel  ly horrible for your daughter!" read another. But then there was this: "I completely understand. I too feel this way." The hard truth is, most parents do. In one research, Catherine Conger, a professor at the University of California at Davis, studied a group of 384 sibling pairs and their parents and visited them three times over three years. She questioned them about their relationships and videotaped them as they worked through conflicts. Overall, she concluded that 65% of mothers and 70% of fathers exhibited a preference for one child, usually the older one. And the real numbers can be much bigger, since parents try especially hard to hide their preferences when a researcher is watching. If the scientists don't see through the trick, however, kids usually do -- and act accordingly. From the moments they're born, brothers and sisters constantly compete for the precious resource of parental attention, each fighting to establish an identity that will best catch Mom's or Dad's eye. I'm the smartest one! I'm the funny one! It's hard to predict the  _ from favoritism. Being the favorite may improve self-esteem and confidence. But studies show it can also leave kids with a sense of arrogance   and privilege. Unfavored children may grow up wondering if they're somehow unworthy of the love the parents gave generously to the golden child. But they may do better at forming relationships outside the family as a result of that. And there's no telling how the differential treatment will play out among the kids. "My mom didn't like my older sister and did like me," says Roseann Henry, an editor and the married mother of two girls. "Everyone assumed I had it great, except that my sister tortured   me pretty much all the time -- and really, what affects daily life more for a kid, the approval of a parent or the day-to-day torture of an older sister?" The sweetness in the lie "We do not have a favorite child" is that parents   _  .
----------
  A: keep telling the same lie seriously
  B: don't want to hurt the unfavored kids
  C: show pity for the unfavored kids
  D: don't tell the truth to the favored kids

Question 262/400:
Erden Eruc has been rowing across the Pacific Ocean in a rowboat since he left California on July 10, 2007. He has been heading for Australia with only birds, fish, and sharks ever since. Crossing the Pacific is only part of his journey. Eruc has decided to go all the way around the world using his own energy. He will row, bike, walk and climb the world without help from any motors  at all. His plan includes climbing the tallest peak on six of the continents  along the way. For the first part of his trip, he bicycled 5,546 miles from Seattle, Washington to Mount McKinley in Alaska and back, walked 67 miles to base camp and climbed 20,320 feet to McKinley's peak. Now in the second part of his adventure , he is rowing to Australia. Why would he try to go around the world this way? He explains that he wants to encourage kids to dream their dreams and get to their own goals. He wants to show kids that there might be hard parts along the way, and sometimes they might not even get to that final goal. But they can have adventures and learn a lot along the way. When his trip around the world takes him across land, he enjoys meeting people---especially children. He has already visited many schools and shared his story. Eruc encourages all kids to set their eyes on a goal and not give up. He says, "with goals, we will make progress, and we will be farther along than when we started, even if we don't get to some goals.  That's called life!" We can learn from the passage that Eruc   _   during his adventure.

Question 263/400:
When Harvard was founded in 1636, there were no other colleges in the American colonies, and it would become the model for many of those that followed. When it began requiring applicants to take a test known as the SAT in 1935, Harvard started another trend. Two years ago, after it announced an aggressive new financial-aid policy, it helped push social class to the center of the national debate over higher education and forced two of its main competitors, Stanford and Yale, to follow its lead. Last week. Harvard began to make another effort to affect higher education in its image, its president, Derek Bok, announced that the college would abandon its early admissions program, which for decades has allowed high school seniors to apply in October and get an answer yes, no or maybe - in December, shortly before the regular deadline for applications. Harvard officials argue that the program is beneficial to rich students who don't need to compare financial-aid offers from various colleges. After the announcement, many people within education urged other colleges to take a similar step. "We're thrilled," said Laurie Kobick, a college counselor   at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va. "I think it's going to make admissions better in so many different ways. It will indeed go a small way toward leveling the field among applicants. Of course, it will also have an effect on colleges, and the biggest winner will almost certainly be Harvard. a fact that may prevent many other colleges - perhaps all of them - from       following Hazard this time. Because any college that does so will risk losing some of its best applicants." By abandoning early admissions program, Harvard wants   _  .
----------
  A: to attract the public's attention
  B: to influence higher education in its own way
  C: to save money spent in attracting students

Question 264/400:
Does technology pose a threat to the purity of Chinese language? Many Chinese use instant messenger tools such as MSN or QQ, listen to music on MP3 players and log on the Internet using ADSL--most without knowing the literal Chinese translation of the abbreviations . But they don't have to, as many English letters have become part of the local vocabulary. A dozen abbreviations including GDP, NBA, IT, MP3, QQ, DVD and CEO are among the 5,000 most-frequently used words in the Chinese media last year, according to a report on the 2006 Language Situation in China. The report said some parents are so keen on English letters that a couple tried to name their baby "@", claiming the character used in email addresses reflects their love for the child. While the "@"is obviously familiar to Chinese e-mail users, they often use the English word "at" to pronounce it "ai ta",or "love him". The study collected more than 1 billion language samples from newspapers, magazines, TV, radio and websites. The annual report is jointly compiled by the Ministry of Education and the State Language Commission. "Nowadays, more and more English abbreviations are being used in Chinese, making them an important part of modern language," said Hou Min, a professor at Communication University of China. "The abbreviations have gained popularity because of the ease of usage," Hou said. For example, DNA is much simpler to use than its Chinese version. "As more Chinese people learn foreign languages, especially English, in recent years, using abbreviations has become a trend among educated people," she added. Some language scholars fear such usage will contaminate the purity of Chinese and cause confusion in communication. Why does the author use the example of a couple who tried to name their baby "@"?
----------
  A: To show Chinese is badly polluted by English.
  B: To express the couple's love for the child.
  C: To indicate "@"is a very common sign among the e-mail users.
  D: To show some people are very enthusiastic over English letters.

Question 265/400:
A middle-aged man with a long beard was caught by the police for bad behavior and property damage. The man, Bill Wild, checked into a hotel last night, telling the clerk he would pay cash in advance and would be staying for four nights. He then asked her where the nearest store was and she told him it was John-Johns. Wild went to the store and bought three gallons of honey and four gallons of chocolate syrup  . The cashier asked him why he wanted these things and he replied, "I'm trying to become a sweeter person." The cashier smiled at the joke. Wild drove back to the hotel. He opened all bottles and poured them into the bathtub  . He added warm water to the mix. He tuned the radio to an opera music station, took off his clothes, jumped into the tub, and started singing loudly with the music. Fifteen minutes later, the neighbor phoned the clerk complaining about the noise. The clerk knocked on Wild's door, but he just kept singing. She phoned his room, but he didn't answer. Then she called the police, who arrived quickly. They broke into the room. The floor was covered in water and the bathtub was full of chocolate and honey. "He seemed so nice and friendly. Who'd have thought he was a bathtub-singing nut?" said the clerk. The police said this was the third time that Wild had been arrested for this kind of behavior. The man bought lots of honey and chocolate syrup to   _  .

Question 266/400:
The Vienna-based researchers showed that dogs will stop doing a simple task when not rewarded if another dog, which continues to be rewarded, is present. The experiment consisted of taking pairs of dogs and getting them to present a paw for a reward.On giving this "handshake" the dogs received a piece of food.One of the dogs was then asked to shake hands, but received no food.The other dog continued to get the food when it was asked to perform the task. The dog without the reward quickly stopped doing the task, and showed signs of anger or stress when its partner was rewarded. To make sure that the experiment was really showing the interaction between the dogs rather than just the frustration of not being rewarded, a similar experiment was conducted where the dogs performed the task without the partner.Here they continued to present the paw for much longer. Dr Frederike Range from the University of Vienna says this shows that it was the presence of the rewarded partner that was the greater influence on their behaviour. "The only difference is one gets food and the other doesn't, they are responding to being unequally rewarded." she said. The researchers say this kind of behaviour, where one animal gets frustrated with what is happening with another, has only been observed in primates  before. Studies with various types of monkeys and chimpanzees show they react not only to seeing their partners receiving rewards when they are not, but also to the type of reward. The dog study also looked at whether the type of reward made a difference.Dogs were given either bread or sausage, but seemed to react equally to either.Dr Range says this may be because they have been trained. The dogs refused to give the paw when they  _  .

  A: found another dog was given nothing

Question 267/400:
The Friends of the Amazon is a nonprofit association helping to preserve the forest, its wildlife and its native cultures in the Peruvian Amazon.  We are located 3 degrees south of the equator in the Region of Loreto, which is roughly the size of Montana and is one of the richest areas in the world in terms of flora  and fauna . Our team consists of lawyers, ecologists, sociologists, medical professionals and native Amazonians working together to protect the forest and its people from destruction. We use litigation , filing lawsuits against those who seek to destroy the forest and its native cultures. In addition to legal processes, we promote health, education, and the conservation of native plants and animals. The Amazon Rainforest is commonly referred to as the "lungs of the planet" whose trees are essential for absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2, a greenhouse gas that causes global warming) and it into oxygen, thereby mitigating the rise of global temperatures and climate change.  An estimated 120 billion tons of carbon dioxide is absorbed in the Amazon Rainforest and global emissions of carbon dioxide increase with every tree of the rainforest that is cut down. That is why the survival of the Amazon Rainforest is vital for the survival of our planet, without which rising global temperatures could melt the polar icecaps and cause flooding of our coastal cities. Currently, the Amazon is under siege , with an estimated 1000 hectares being destroyed everyday.  After harvesting old growth forests, corporations are often replacing the native forest with palm oil plantations instead of reforesting with native tree species.  Palm oil trees are native to Africa, not the Amazon, and due to high profits, their promotion by international aid agencies and recent legislation in Peru, palm oil plantations represent perhaps the single greatest threat to the native Amazon Rainforest. In addition to conventional logging and deforesting to make room for crops such as palm oil and soybeans, the Amazon forest faces a new threat in the form of REDD projects and "Carbon Cowboys".  REDD refers to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation by using carbon offsets ("carbon credits").  Under the guise of REDD projects, scammers are tricking native communities into signing unjust contracts in English without legal representation which essentially give these so called Carbon Cowboys the forest for free. These cheaters are making false promises of "billions of dollars in profits" from REDD and voluntary carbon offset  projects by lying that they are representatives of the United Nations and World Bank in order to trick vulnerable indigenous Amazonians into ceding their land by signing unjust contracts with hidden clauses that give the Carbon Cowboys a power of attorney to do whatever they want with the forest for a period of 100 years.  Friends of the Amazon is actively filing lawsuits against these Carbon Cowboys and those who support them.

Question 268/400:
Camilla Broomstick, a missing Camden -area woman, was reported found inside her damaged Chevrolet Malibu Sunday afternoon in a County near Camden New Jersey, at the bottom of an embankment  off a highway, according to authorities. Her car, turned upside down, was spotted by a passer-by who had stopped to view scenery and noticed something shining and what looked like a body, authorities said. When emergency responders arrived, they found Broomstick alive inside her severely damaged car. The vehicle rested upside down after flying 120 feet off the highway and rolling an additional 200 feet into an aspen woods. "The crash alone would have killed her," New Jersey State Trooper Dean Enoch said. "It's surprising that she survived the crash at all, and then to be down there for that amount of days without food or water." Earlier Monday, the family released a statement at the hospital thanking emergency responders who rushed Broomstick to the hospital and to the man who found her and notified authorities. "We sincerely appreciate all the thoughts, prayers and kind gestures from the community during such a hard time for our family," the statement read. "While we're hopeful of her prognosis , Camilla was seriously injured and with multiple internal and external injuries. Later this afternoon Camilla will be undergoing surgery here to amputate  both of her feet. Doctors were not able to save her feet due to the serious injuries. Camilla is in critical but stable condition at this time and has a very long road ahead." In the statement, family members mentioned reports that Broomstick wrote a request for help on an umbrella she pushed out the car window. "We cannot comment on that right now because we have not seen the umbrella," the statement said. Family members also asked that the public respect their privacy. Where was the damaged car when it was found?

Question 269/400:
Zhu Haoyu, 18, a history major, wears his iPod everywhere on campus. The freshman has it going out for a walk, visiting the library or lying in bed. However, he found that his habit is like displaying a big "Do not disturb "sign for himself. As time slips away, he has begun to regret not having conversed much with his peers around . "As I put the little buds   into my ears, I'm in a universe of my own, forgetting all troubles in the real world," said Li. The MP3 player is one of a number of gadgets  --starting with the Sony Walkman, which led to the iPod, iPhone and iPad --that give people the ability to shut themselves off from world around them. Youngsters delight in handset   technology. In public, students chat on their cell phones, stopping only to talk briefly to friends. On buses or trains it's common to see youngsters with PlayStations instead of playing poker or sharing jokes or games. And during airline flights, people watch episodes   of US TV dramas on their iPads, rather than talking. The recently published an article saying that headphone wearing culture is making us anti-social. "Half of humankind is wired to a parallel universe that leaves them ignoring their surroundings and fellows," wrote Tom de Castella. Actually, it's a decade since Apple unveiled the iPod, which promised "1,000 songs in your pocket". In 2007 more than half of Western residents were using an iPod or MP3 player. Entertainment is on offer in all surroundings, not just at home. But in the meantime, it has created barriers between us. Many people subscribe to the view that the headphone culture is creating a "spoilt, selfish generation that lacks civic culture". However, many users of portable MP3 players argue that the device, as a mind drug, helps them relieve stress by escaping for a while. It is also said to be able to help some students concentrate on work or study. "If you want to get away from the hucksters   on the way, just start listening to your player," said Liu, a freshman. "They do not approach people with headphones on." This might also mean he's blocking those who want to ask him for the directions. Experts, however, say that short contacts or mini conversations with strangers are helpful to our mind. Many experts warn that it is dangerous to lose touch with people in our lives. Zhu Haoyu found that his wearing the iPod    _    .
----------
  A: disturbed others

Fresh mushrooms are tastier than the ones that are stored in your refrigerator. If you have had a really good crop of mushrooms, then you can even store them. Ideally you should use the white variety of the mushrooms. Simply pick them, slice them and put them on a cookie sheet in a freezer. When they area frozen, just put them in a zip lock and you can use them when you want to. They give a really great taste to the dish that you are making. Thaw them before you use them.

Question 271/400:
China Daily: As China comes down from a travel rush during the seven-day holiday for National Day, people called for a return of the Labor Day Golden Week holiday as a way to ease  the travel peak. By Friday, 79 million passengers were expected to have used the railways up about 8 percent over last year. Waterways had shipped around 2 million, a rise of about 17 percent on last year, www. cntv. cn, the website of China Central Television, said on Saturday. As large numbers of tourists _ scenic spots around China, it caused huge crowds and many complaints. The Forbidden City in Beijing has long been a big draw for travelers. On Tuesday alone, the museum reported, it received more than 180,000 visitors, about six times higher than a regular day. According to China Central Television, restless visitors demanded their money back from the tourism committee, and police were sent to help deal with the problem. The Beijing-HongKong-Macao expressway, the Shanghai-Kunming expressway and the route from Beijing to Kunming saw large increases in traffic on Saturday, according to www. cntv. cn. "As there are only two long holidays in the country and paid leave is not well carried out by employers , people have limited chances for travel", Dai Bin, the director of China Tourism Academy, said in a report by Beijing Times on Saturday. "The travel rush during the 'Golden Week' holidays happens because people do not take long journeys during shorter holidays", said Liu Simin, a researcher with the China Academy of Social Sciences, in a report by Beijing Times on Saturday. Liu said that now the most important task is to ease the pressure from the huge numbers of tourists. When the Labor Day Golden Week holiday came to an end in 2007, a chance to travel was reduced. In 2008, the government shortened the Labor Day Golden Week holiday, usually lasting from May 1 to May 7, to three days and added three other short vacations to the list. Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?
----------
  A: People called for a return of the Labor Day Golden Week holiday.
  B: The museum reported it received more than 180,000 visitors during the holiday.

Question 273/400:
In Vietnam, two members of a family of street vendors are finding a way to help the poorest students in Hanoi. Pham Minh Dap and his brother are providing the students with mostly free English and Japanese lessons at a learning center they created. The men want to help people who would not normally have a chance to learn a foreign language. Some education experts in Vietnam say such knowledge may help college graduates get jobs. The country's economy has improved. But many graduates continue to have a hard time finding employment. Local media reported ten percent of university graduates do not have a job. Earlier this year, 24-year-old Pham Minh Dap and his brother established a school they call "Stand By You". Volunteers teach poor students English and Japanese. Many classes are free. Students with some language knowledge pay 25 to 50 cents per class. Mr. Dap pays about $ 500 to rent the language center space and for other costs. He gives about $ 150 from his earnings as a street Vendor and private language teaching. His brother gives the same amount from the money he earns as a secretary. Friends provide the rest. Mr. Dap and many of his family members have sold things outside HoaBinh Park in the center of Vietnam's capital for five years. They come from a village of rice farmers in Thanh Hoa Province. Twenty-four-year-old Pham THi Trang is one of 600 students at the language school. She is finishing her university studies. Her parents work in a market in a village in Ha Nam Province. She says life is hard in the city. She earns about $50 a month from a part-time job, and her parents give her $ 75. But this is not enough to live on. She has said she has to be very careful with money so she can pay her bills. Demand for the school is growing. About 1,000 people are on a waiting list to enter. Ten people have offered to teach for free. And Mr. Dap says he is hoping to raise money to pay for a bigger place. He wants to open more classes. The main idea of the passage is   _  .
----------
  A: street vendors help the poor to learn English and Japanese.
  B: the demand for school is growing in Vietnam.
  C: free learning of English and Japanese are provided in Vietnam.
  D: students in Vietnam are very poor.

Question 274/400:
You must know what BYD stands for? Yes, Build Your Dream. Have you built your dream and spare no effort to achieve it? Here is an inspiring story from http//www.naijamotiveation.com Eddie Arcaro dreamed of becoming the world's greatest jockey . But after watching him ride a horse for five minutes, reality reflected a rough contradiction. He was awkward and clumsy, and in his early years in the saddle( )he couldn't do one thing right. In his first 100 races he never even came close to winning. Still, he got right back on and trained again. Even as a schoolboy, Arcaro had set his own track in life. Because he was only a little over five feet tall (1.5 meters) and weighed barely 80 pounds (36kg), the other students _ him. So he skipped school, hanging out at the local race track where a trainer let him ride horses. His father reluctantly agreed to let him pursue a career as a jockey. The trainer had told him so. "Send him back to school," he said. "He'll never be a rider." In spite of that, Arcaro was determined not just to ride, but to become the world's greatest jockey. But first someone would have to give him a chance. He finally got to ride in a real race. Before it was over, he'd lost his whip and his cap and had almost fallen off the saddle. By the time he finished the race, the other horses were on their way to the stables . He'd come in dead last. Nevertheless, Arcaro went from track to track, looking for any opportunity to ride. Finally, a trainer who pitied him took him in and gave him a chance. One hundred losses later, he was still giving him chances. He saw something in this unlucky jockey, something he couldn't define. There were many brushes with death and several broken bones. Every time he would return to the saddle. Then Arcaro began to win. In thirty years of riding, he won 4, 779 races, becoming the only jockey in history to win the Kentucky Derby five times. By the time he retired in 1962 he was a millionaire and a legend in his own lifetime. The trainer who believed in Arcaro gave him chances because   _  .

  A: Arcaro had shown great talents in horse racing

Question 275/400:
There are several reasons why some people enjoy a better standard of living than other people. Then again, some people work very hard for their entire life and only are able to pay their monthly living expenses. As a matter of fact, they usually end up working until the last day they are alive. On the other hand, many people who are well off, so to speak, and through no fault of their own, experience a rapid decline of their standard of living due to an unexpected disaster, poor health and /or a severe economic depression within the country in which they live. Additionally, well-educated people usually earn more money during their active working years and thus are able to save a great deal of money in which to support themselves after they retire from the work force. People also become wealthy as a result of their own determination or they inherit wealth from elder family members, or they simply continue to work in the business that past generations of their family worked within. It is also true that a person can simply be a lucky dog who wins a lottery or some such contests that give a great deal of wealth to the winner. Let us not forget about the self-made individuals who have a dream of achieving fame and fortune and, after many years truly hard work, are well-rewarded for their continued efforts. An example of whom is the person who wrote the Harry Potter novels. She was just an average person who became a billionaire. So too, Ray Croc, the founder of a chain of fast food restaurants, became rich and famous at a time in life when most people retire from the workforce. Bill Gates is another person, who, by his own determination, skill and hard work, became rich and famous, as well as Ben Franklin and Thomas Edison. As you can see, there are many ways in which to become wealthy and enjoy an above average standard of living. However, those who are motivated by greed and become criminals as a result of such greed end up causing harm to others, as they continue to suck the wealth out of other people within the society. Those criminals simply take all that they get and give back little or nothing in return. What is your plan for achieving financial security, happiness, fame, and fortune? Who might be admired by the author based on the text?
----------
  A: Those who receive great wealth from their pest generation.
  B: Those who are lucky enough to win a lottery or things like that.
  C: Those who are well-educated and work hard to gain their wealth.
  D: Those who get the wealth because of their fame or special experiences.

Question 276/400:
I began working in journalism when I was eight. It was my mother's idea. She wanted me to "make something" of myself, and decided I had better start young if I was to have any chance of keeping up with the competition. With my load of magazines I headed toward Belleville Avenue. The crowds were there. There were two gas stations on the corner of Belleville and Union. For several hours I made myself highly visible, making sure everyone could see me and the heavy black letters on the bag that said THE SATURDAY EVENING POST. When it was suppertime, I walked back home. " How many did you sell, my boy?" my mother asked. " None." " Where did you go?" " The corner of Belleville and Union Avenues." " What did you do?" " Stood on the corner waiting for somebody to buy a Saturday Evening Post." " You just stood there?" " Didn't sell a single one." " My God, Russell!" Uncle Allen put in, " Well, I've decided to take the Post." I handed him a copy and he paid me a nickel. It was the first nickel I earned. Afterwards my mother taught me how to be a salesman. I would have to ring doorbells, address adults with self-confidence, and persuade them by saying that no one, no matter how poor, could afford to be without the Saturday Evening Post in the home. One day, I told my mother I'd changed my mind. I didn't want to make a success in the magazine business. " If you think you can change your mind like this," she replied, " you'll become a good-for-nothing." She insisted that, as soon as school was over, I should start ringing doorbells, selling magazines. Whenever I said no, she would scold me. My mother and I had fought this battle almost as long as I could remember. My mother, dissatisfied with my father's plain workman's life, determined that I would not grow up like him and his people. But never did she expect that, forty years later, such a successful journalist as me would go back to her husband's people for true life and love. What is the text mainly about?
----------
  A: The early life of a journalist.
  B: The early success of a journalist.
  C: The happy childhood of the writer.
  D: The important role of the writer in his family.

Question 277/400:
What should you think about when trying to find your career? You are probably better at some school subjects than others. These may show strengths that you can use in your work. A boy who is good at mathematics can use that in an engineering career. A girl who spells well and likes English may be good at office work. So it is important to know the subjects you do well in at school. On the other hand, you may not have any especially strong subjects but your records show a general satisfactory standard. Although not all subjects can be used directly in a job, they may have indirect value. A knowledge of history is not required for most jobs but if history is one of your good subjects you will have learned to remember facts and details. This is an ability that can be useful in many jobs. Your school may have taught you skills, such as typing or technical drawing, which you can use in your work. You may be good at metalwork or cookery and look for a job where you can improve these skills. If you have had a part-time job on Saturdays or in the summer, think what you gained from it. If nothing else, you may have learned how to get to work on time, to follow instructions and to get on with older workers. You may have learned to give correct change in a shop, for example. Just as important, you may become interested in a particular industry or career you see from the inside in a part-time job. Facing your weak points is also part of knowing yourself. You may _ when you handle tools; perhaps you are a poor speller or cannot add up a column of figures. It is better to face any weakness than to pretend they do not exist. Your school record, for instance, may not be too good, yet it is an important part of your background. You should not be apologetic  about it but instead recognize that you will have a chance of a fresh start at work. What is the passage mainly about?
----------
  A: The importance of working hard at school.
  B: Choosing a career according to one's strengths.
  C: How to face one's weakness.
  D: The value of school work.

Question 278/400:
There are several reasons for hair loss in women. However, in most cases, treatment is quite effective. Female hair loss patterns in women are not as easily recognizable as they are in men. A woman may experience it temporarily due to pregnancy or illness, although they may experience it for other reasons. Hair loss can be due to a variety of factors, including a genetic tendency (which is not genetically linked to just one parent--both parents contribute to the tendency to lose hair). Women who are experiencing hair problems seem to have more limited choices than men. There are some female hair loss treatments that are available such as the Tricomin System which is a topical treatment that is nutrition based. Shen Min for Women is another natural treatment that contains herbs   that are said to stimulate  hair growth and even restore hair that is graying to its natural color1. The majority of the popular, prove hair loss treatments are only intended for men and are not suitable for women. True, a woman's hair issue is different from a man's. The biological makeup is different and the needs are different. Women have different needs and their bodies react in different ways to environmental changes, physical illness and even the treatments that are available. There are many natural treatments such as vitamin and mineral supplements that are said to stimulate hair growth, but, for the most part, these claims are currently unproven. One of the first and most important factors to effectively treating is to get a diagnosis from a doctor. Talk to your doctor about any symptoms  that you may be experiencing in addition to the thinning hair. Stress, weight loss or gain, illness and depression, all of these can be contributing factors. The reasons for the differences between the female and male hair loss problems do not include_.
----------
  A: The biological structure and composition of the hair
  B: The wants and needs
  C: The reactions and responses to the outside changes
  D: The approach to taking exercise

Question 279/400:
A new study finds that our brains are wired to make music-color connections depending on how the music makes us feel. Mozart's "Flute Concerto No.1 in G Major" is most often associated with bright yellow and orange, whereas his "Requiem in D Minor" is linked to bluish gray, the findings revealed. US researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, enlisted nearly 100 subjects for a study on music and color. With 37 colors, the UC Berkeley study found that people tend to pair faster-paced music in a major key with lighter, more vivid, yellow colors, whereas slower-paced music in a minor key is more likely to be teamed up with darker, grayer, bluer colors. "Surprisingly, we can predict with 95 percent accuracy how happy or sad the colors people pick will be based on how happy or sad the music is that they are listening to," said lead author and UC Berkeley vision scientist Stephen Palmer. In three experiments, the subjects listened to 18 classical music pieces that varied in pace (slow, medium, fast) and in major VS minor keys. In the first experiment, participants were asked to pick five of the 37 colors that best matched the music to which they were listening. Separately, they rated each piece of music on a scale of happy to sad, strong to weak, lively to dull, and calm to angry. Next, the research team plans to study particiapants in Turkey where traditional music employs a wider range of scales than just major and minor. "We know that in Mexico and the US the responses are very similar," Palmer said. "But we don't yet know about China or Turkey." What did the US researchers find from the result of the new study?
----------
  A: There are colors that do not match any music.
  B: People tend to connect happy colors to slow-paced music
  C: There is a one-to-one connection between music and color.
  D: People nearly do the same in picking colors for different music.

Question 280/400:
There are many ways of defining success. It is accurate to say that each of us has our own ideas of success to the extent that each of us is responsible for setting our own goals and determining whether we have met these goals satisfactorily. Because each of us possesses unique differences in genetic ability and favorable environments in which to express these abilities, it is necessarily true that we must define success broadly. For some people,simply being able to live their life with the least misery and sufferings is considered a success. Think of the peace of mind of the poor shepherd who tends his sheep, enjoys his simple life with his family in the beauty of nature, and who is respected because he does a good job of achieving the goals expected of him and accepted by his family and his society. On the other hand, it seems that even though some people appear to be rich in material possessions, many of them seem to be miserable and consider themselves unsuccessful when judged by their own standards of success. Because not all ventures can be successful, one should not set unrealistic goals for achieving success, but if one has self-confidence it would be unfortunate to set one's goals at too low a level of achievement. A wise man once said to a young man who was experiencing frustration with his own professional success, "You do not have to set your goal to reach the moon in order to have success in traveling. Sometimes one can be very successful merely by taking a walk in the park or riding the subway downtown," The man added, "You have not really failed and spoiled your chances for success until you have been unsuccessful at something you really like,and to which you have given your best effort. " The purpose of the passage is  _  .
----------
  A: to give us a clear definition of what success is
  B: to talk about how to achieve success
  C: to state what our life goal is
  D: to discuss the importance of goals

Question 281/400:
Yesterday,I overheard our 9-year-old son,Aaron,talking to his friend,Zach. "Oh,God!"Zach began,looking in Aaron's closet "Where are all your toys?" "Oh,we are doing something called Simplicity plan,so I basically got rid of 80% of my stuff . " "What? Did your mom and dad make you do this?" "No, Idecided to do it because I wanted to.When I give away a lot of my things,I make room for family activities. I did it because I wanted to live differently and have less stuff in my life." "But still,why would you choose to get rid of most of your toys?" "Part of the reason is that my parents were doing it with their stuff .And my mom talked to me about it and explained how they felt happier afterwards. And I thought maybe I really had spent a lot of my time in my room playing with toys instead of spending time with my parents and sister." "Seriously?" "I feel proud because I am a person who has just what I need and not more. And I'm starting new activities like writing how I feel,reading more,and spending more time doing housework around the house." "OK.Let me get this. You have fewer toys,more housework,and you feel happier?" "Well, it's not that the housework is fun ,But I do it with my parents. We talk and connect while we are doing it, so that is the fun.And we've been doing more activities together, like reading aloud at night. And on weekends,we have conversations or go out together, instead of my dad being at his computer,my mom cleaning and me playing with my toys." We can learn from the passage that Aaron  _  .

Question 284/400:
LONDON (Reuters Life!) ---- Forget about talking your children into considering life as a doctor or a teacher and start training them for the talent show. A survey of British parents showed the aspirations   of their children are greatly different from what they dreamed about when considering who they wanted to be when they grew up. Although astronaut   still remains fairly high on the list of careers   kids dream about these days, others like doctor and teacher have been taken the place of by the desire   to win good name and money as a sporting hero, pop star or actor. The parents of children aged 5 to 11 said the choice of lawyer had dropped by only one place on a top 10 list to sixth, while teacher had dropped to ninth from top in the last 25 or more years. The survey for British TV channel "Watch" found a great difference between the genders   of today's young people when compared with their parents' dreams 25 years or more ago. Playing professional football, being an astronaut and joining the firefighting service topped the boys' choices, while girls are more likely to be dreaming of taking to the stage as a pop star or actress or joining the medical profession. When asked what they would like their children to do for a living, today's parents still like the academic   professions  , with law and medicine scoring highly, while being a boss came third. Parents also praised job happiness above wealth   when it comes to their hopes for their children. Nearly 70 percent of the parents surveyed thought that they failed to follow their dreams when it came to their career, with 37 percent thinking it was caused by a lack of aspiration and not having the necessary conditions. From the passage we know that most parents still hope that in the future their children can take up    _   .

Question 285/400:
GOLDEN, British Columbia (AP)---A 3-year-old girl found alive in the upside down wreckage of an airplane survived because she was  _ in a car seat, rescuers said. They said they knew she was OK when she cried for her teddy bear. Sunday's crash killed Kate Williams' pilot-grandfather, Allen D. Williams, 65, and another passenger, authorities said. The plane was found nose down and turned over in the icy water at the edge of a riverbank in the mountains of southeast prefix = st1 /British Columbia. "What saved her life was being strapped into that car seat," said Mike Plonka, a member of the search-and-rescue team. "You could see that she was very frightened. Her big concern at the time was her little teddy bear. She didn't want to leave without it. . . " "She was just pointing at it and calling it 'Baby'. " he said Monday. The girl suffered head injuries but was reported as stable, hospital officials in Golden said. She was reunited with her parents.  Police said the Cessna 172 was on its way to Edmontonwhen it took off from Golden around 1 pm Sunday into low clouds and snow. Visibility was poor. An hour later, the Search and Rescue Centre in Victoria picked up the plane's emergency signal from somewhere near the BlaeberryRiver. A team using a hand-held beacon locator found the wreckage, and two military search and rescue technicians--Sgt. Scott Elliston and Master Cpl. Bruno Lapointe---landed nearby in a helicopter. As they checked for survivors, they discovered the girl alive but surrounded by debris in the back of the plane. The two soldiers tried to remove her from the wreckage, but she made it clear she didn't want to leave without her teddy bear.  "I got her out and I handed her to Bruno. She was calling out for her teddy bear. I picked up the teddy bear to give it to her but it was covered with snow. She wasn't too happy that it was covered with snow so I brushed it off. "Elliston said.  Williams was CEO and founder of Edmonton-based A. D. Williams Engineering Inc. The passenger who was killed, Steven T. Sutton, was chief financial officer. The two had been attending a business meeting in Golden. The cause of the accident was under investigation. What is the cause of the accident?
----------
  A: Low clouds.
  B: Not mentioned.
  C: Heavy snow.
  D: Poor visibility.

Question 286/400:
Onceupon a time, some visitors went to an island for a vacation, and each was having a good time. Suddenly a warning of a strong storm came to them, so all rushed to their boats.

Just then Richness was passing by in a great large boat. Love shouted, "Richness, can you take me with you? Richness answered, "No, I can't. There is a lot of gold in my boat. There is no place here for you. " Love decided to ask Vanity  for help who was also passing by in a beautiful boat. But Vanity said with a cold voice, "No, I can't take you with me. My boat will get dirty with your wet feet. " Sadness passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was useless. "No, I can't take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be alone. " When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help. But Happiness was so happy that he didn't hear Love calling to him. Love was becoming restless and hopeless. Just then somebody called out, "Come, Love! I will take you with me. " Love did not know who was so kind, but jumped into the boat happily. After getting off the boat, Love met Knowledge. Love asked, "Knowledge, do you know who was so kind to give me a lift when no one else wished to help?" [:Zxxk.Com] Knowledge smiled, "Oh, that was Time. " "Time?" asked Love. "But why did Time help me?" Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how great Love is. " What can we learn from the passage?

Question 287/400:
In a world as fast-changing and full of information as our own, all of us need to know how to learn well. Yet evidence suggests that most of us don't use the learning techniques that science has proved the most effective. The scientific literature evaluating these techniques goes back to decades and across thousands of articles. It's far too _ and complex for the average parent, teacher or employer to look through. Fortunately, a team of five leading psychologists have done the job for us. Professor John Dunlosky and other psychologists closely examined 10 learning strategies and rated each from high to low utility  on the basis of the evidence they've gathered. Here's part of their conclusions: In contrast to familiar practices, the effective learning strategies with the most evidence to support them aren't well known outside the lab. Take distributed practice, for example. This strategy involves spreading out your study time, rather than engaging in one marathon. Cramming  information at the last minute may allow you to get through that test or meeting, but the material will quickly disappear from your memory. It's much more effective to look through the material at intervals over time. And the longer you want to remember the information, whether it's two weeks or two years, the longer the intervals should be. The second learning strategy that is highly recommended by Dunlosky is practice testing. Yes, more tests---but there not for a grade. Research shows that the mere act of calling information to mind strengthens that knowledge and aids in future retrieval  . While practice testing is not a common strategy---despite the strong evidence supporting it ---there is one familiar approach that captures its benefits: using flash cards. And now flash cards can be presented in digital form. Both distributed practice and practice testing were rated as having "high utility" by Dunlosky. The evidence shows that the strategy of practice testing   _  .
----------
  A: is a way to use flash cards to help study
  B: is mainly used to help us remember well
  C: helps know about students' grades in time
  D: is a way widely used to strengthen memory

Question 290/400:
Doctor are known to Be terriBle pilots. They don't listen Because they already know it all. I was lucky: Became a pilot in 1970, almost ten years Before I graduated from medical school. I didn't realize then, But Becoming a pilot makes me a Better surgeon. I loved flying. As I flew Bigger, faster planes, and in worse weather. I learned aBout crew resource management  , or CRM, a new idea to make flying safer. It means that crew memBers should listen and speak up for a good result, regardless of positions. I first read aBout CRM in 1980. Not long after that, an attending doctor and I were flying in Bad weather. The controller had us turn too late to get our landing ready. The attending doctor was flying; I was safety pilot He was so Busy Because of the Bad turn, he had forgotten to put the landing gear   down. He was a Better pilot - and my Boss - so it felt unusual to speak up. But I had to: Our lives were in danger. I put aside my uneasiness and said, "We need to put the landing gear down now!" That was my first real lesson in the power of CRM, and I've used it in the operating room ever since. CRM requires that the pilot/surgeon encourage others to speak up. It further requires that when opinions are from the opposite, the doctor doesn't overreact, which might prevent fellow doctors from voicing opinions again. So when I'm in the operating room, I ask for ideas and help from others. Sometimes they're not willing to speak up. But I hope that if I continue to encourage them , someday someone will keep me  from " ". What dose the author say aBout doctors in general?
----------
  A: They like flying By themselves.
  B: They are unwilling to take advice.
  C: They pretend to Be good pilots.
  D: They are quick learners of CRM.

Question 295/400:
The life-long benefits of teaching children good money habits make it well worth the effort. Children who are not taught these lessons pay the consequences for a life time. Some parents don't teach children about money because they think they shouldn't talk about money with children, don't have the time, or think they don't have enough money. Parents should take the time to teach children about money regardless of their income and should start when children are young. Most people have strong feelings and opinions about money, based on childhood experiences and the values and beliefs of their families. Most often, these experiences, values, and beliefs are different for each parent. It is important for the healthy development of children that parents talk about these feelings and opinions and establish a consistent approach to teaching children about money. Here are some guidelines parents can keep in mind as they begin the financial socialization of their children: Advise rather than order how the child's money should be used. Allow children to learn by mistakes and by successes. Be consistent while taking children's differences into account. Include all family members in money management discussions, decision making, and activities suitable for their age. Explan to children what they can and cannot do and the consequences of going above the limits. As children get older increasingly include them in discussions of limits and consequences. Expect all family members to perform unpaid, routine household work based on their abilities. Express your desire to have things you can't afford. Children need to know that parents say "no" to themselves, too. Which of the following are parents advised to do?
----------
  A: To allow children to make mistakes if they're likely to succeed.
  B: To make children do housework for the family and pay them.
  C: To help children learn to say "no" to their own unrealistic desires.
  D: To encourage children to set limits for themselves.

Question 297/400:
One of the worst feelings you have as a professional athlete is the feeling after losing a game to a team that you should have beaten. That happened last night against the lowly Boston Celtics. They had only won 13 games the whole year and were really struggling. We had just come off a very good win against the Orlando Magic on the road and were feeling good about ourselves. The day did not start out good for us when we learned that T-Mac was going to miss the game with the flu. When you lose your best players (Yao, T-Mac) everyone must play a little harder and do a little bit more on the floor. We inserted Bonzi Wells into the lineup (he was the only one to have a good game for us), in place of T-Mac. It was a nasty game. We are usually one of the best three point shooting teams in the NBA and we only made 1 of 22 three point shots! I have never seen that happen. Never! Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious. In the locker room after the game, everybody felt terrible. When we play a bad game, we feel that we let our teammates down. There is a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach when you leave the gym and you just want to go home and not talk to anyone. It is a terrible feeling, but it is a feeling that makes you want to try harder and do better the next time. I'll talk to you guys later. Shane How do you think the writer might describe his performance that night?

Question 298/400:
One afternoon, four black youths walked into a restaurant that served "whites" only. They sat down and ordered bread and milk. The white waiter just said "We don't serve blacks". The young men did not move. They were tired to death of segregation  and of being kicked around. The manager was called. When he saw the angry look in their eyes, he said that he was sorry, but it was not possible to serve them. The next day, more young black people came, and even more came the day after to the restaurant. Then a gang of white youths came in and attacked them. Most of the blacks were beaten up and were black and blue all over. After that the police rushed in, the several people were put in prison---all of them were black, although they had not done anything wrong---just because they were black. The news spread quickly through the black living areas in the city. A large crowd held a meeting round the restaurant the following day, forcing  the restaurant to shut. Young men, black and white, made speeches protesting against segregation and pointing out that black people only wanted to live a life in the same way that whites did. They gave out leaflets and soon the movement spread to other cities. Business became so bad at that particular restaurant that the owners were forced to give and served blacks. Nowadays, all the blacks are served in all restaurants open to the public in America. The purpose of helding a meeting round the restaurant to  _  .

Question 299/400:
There's a big distinction between working hard and being a workaholic.  Working hard involves being organized, focused, getting a lot of work done, knowing when to stop, and having a life other than work. Workaholics, on the other hand, are often disorganized, always find reasons for working more, feel lost without work to do, hide from problems through work, don't know how or when to relax, bring work home from the office, can't communicate well with fellow workers and family members, and have unbalanced, one-dimensional lives.  Workaholics, like those who are constantly drunk, suffer from a controlling habit, usually defined as compelling behavior despite negative consequences. They are sometimes pushed into their habit by their work beliefs, by workaholic role models, and by a work system that automatically sanctions workaholism. Despite lip service to the contrary ("a balanced employee is a productive employee"), most employers want loyal employees who work longer hours, rewarding them with higher pay and better benefits. _ Certainly, they hazard their jobs by working normal hours. Americans tend to become trapped in a materialist work-and-spend cycle, that leads them to ratchet up their expectations. According to some psychology counselors, workaholism can be both good and bad for us. It can fuel a sense of self-worth and accomplishment. And we get paid for it and praised for it, which produces good feelings we may not necessarily be able to attain in other parts of our lives. As a matter of fact, workaholism is a problem that has been evident since the Stone Age whenever people have sought to escape other parts of their lives through work. And psychology counselors have noticed three types of workaholics who generally share the same features. Which of the following is Not the characteristic of workaholics?
----------
  A: They often deal with their work in a disorganized way.
  B: They can't balance their work with family life well.
  C: They often drink a lot and always get drunk at work.
  D: They are sometimes driven to work by a controlling habit.

Question 301/400:
The economy has developed a lot while the Internet is still not fully used in China. A study shows that about two-thirds of typical Chinese Internet users use the computer for news, often entertainment-related, or for online games, music or movies, all can be downloaded for free. Most prefers messages to e-mail, seldom makes online shopping at all. Although they are now depending on the Internet more often than before to communicate with others who have the same professions, hobbies and political interests, online shopping still remains unpopular in China. Three-quarters of users surveyed have never bought anything over the Internet, and only 10 percent do shopping even once a month. Among those who do buy online, most pay for entertainment while others buy phone cards, or computer hardware or software. "Many people don't trust the quality of goods bought online," the researcher said, "If they buy it in a store and don't like it, they can easily bring it back." The survey was done in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Changsha. Results do not necessarily project countrywide because Internet use in the countryside is lower than in cities. The study showed that the typical netizens   in the five cities are richer and more highly educated. Males make up two-thirds of the group, and more than 80 percent of users are under 24.Surprisingly, with the ages increase, the percentage decreases. China has more than 200 million people online, however, forty-two percent say they do not use search engines. Others seek entertainment news, as well as information useful for work or study on line. Baidu. com was used by half of those surveyed, compared with a quarter for Google, the leading search engine in the United States. A typical Chinese Internet user will be the one who   _  .

Question 302/400:
When we worry about who might be spying on our private lives, we usually think about the Federal agents. But the private sector outdoes the government every time. It's Linda Tripp, not the FBI, who is facing charges under Maryland's laws against secret telephone taping. It's our banks, not the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that pass our private financial data to telemarketing firms. Consumer activists are pressing Congress for better privacy laws without much result so far. The legislators lean toward letting business people track our financial habits virtually at will. As an example of what's going on, consider U.S. Bancorp, which was recently sued for deceptive practices by the state of Minnesota. According to the lawsuit, the bank supplied a telemarketer called Member Works with sensitive customer data such as names, phone numbers, bank-account and credit-card numbers, social security numbers, account balances and credit limits. With these customer lists in hand, Member Works started dialing for dollars-selling dental plans, videogames, computer software and other products and services. Customers who accepted a "free trial offer" had 30 days to cancel. If the deadline passed, they were charged automatically through their bank or credit-card accounts. U.S. Bancorp collected a share of the revenues. Customers were doubly deceived, the lawsuit claims. They didn't know that the bank was giving account numbers to Member Works. And if customers asked, they were led to think the answer was no. The state sued Member Works separately for deceptive selling. The company denies that it did anything wrong. For its part, U.S. Bancorp settled without admitting any mistakes. But it agreed to stop exposing its customers to nonfinancial products sold by outside firms. A few top banks decided to do the same. Many other banks will still do business with Member Works and similar firms. And banks will still be mining data from your account in order to sell you financial products, including things of little value, such as credit insurance and credit-card protection plans. You have almost no protection from businesses that use your personal accounts for profit. For example, no federal law shields "transaction and experience" information-mainly the details of your bank and credit-card accounts. Social Security numbers are for sale by private firms. They've generally agreed not to sell to the public. But to businesses, the numbers are an open book. Self-regulation doesn't work. A firm might publish a privacy-protection policy, but who enforces it? Take U.S. Bancorp again. Customers were told, in writing, that "all personal information you supply to us will be considered confidential." Then it sold your data to Member Works. The bank even claims that it doesn't "sell" your data at all. It merely "shares" it and reaps a profit. Now you know. When the "free trial" deadline is over, you'll be charged without notice for a product or service if   _  .
----------
  A: you happen to reveal your credit card number
  B: you fail to cancel it within the specified period
  C: you fail to apply for extension of the deadline

But it really doesn't have to be that way," said Anaclerio. Last summer, Anaclerio and her friend Jill Carlisle, a Northbrook mother of a 2-year -old, founded a home party-planning business called "A Party in a Basket." Their goal is to help parents and children share in the fun part of party planning, like choosing the subject or making a cake, while they take care of everything. Drawing on their experiences as mothers, they have created 10 ready-to-use, home party packages. Everything a family needs to plan a party, except the cake and ice cream, is delivered to the home in a large basket. "Our parties are aimed for children 2 to 10, " Anaclerio said, "and they're very interactive   and creative in that they build a sense of drama based on a subject. For example, at the Soda Shoppe party the guests become waiters and waitresses and build wonderful ice cream creations." The standard $ 200 package for eight children includes a basket filled with invitations, gifts, games and prizes, paper goods, a party planner and the like. For more information, call Anaclerio at 708-864-6584 or Carlisle at 708-205-9141. The most important idea behind the kind of party planning described here is that   _  .

Question 305/400:
One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported. Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment. Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the "splint" with a 3-D printer. "It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly," Green told NPR. On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs? Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert. As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently. 3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow. "We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts," Green said. "And we're able to do things that were never possible before." According to the passage, doctors' attitude toward 3-D printing technology in medical care is   _  .

Question 306/400:
Herta Muller, the Romanian-born German writer, has won the 2009 Nobel Prize for Literature.The award was announced in Stockholm on Thursday.          Ms.Muller, 56, immigrated to Germany from Romania in 1987.She is the first German writer to win the Nobel in literature since Gunter Grass in 1999 and the 13th winner writing in German since the prize was first given in 1901.She is the 12th woman to win the literature prize.But unlike previous winners like Doris Lessing and V.S.Naipaul, Ms.Muller is  ly unknown outside of literary circles in Germany.          "I am very surprised and still cannot believe it," Ms.Muller said in a statement delivered by her publisher in Germany."I can't say anything more at the moment."          She has written some 20 books, but just 5 have been translated into English, including the novels "The Land of Green Plums" and "The Appointment."          At the news conference on Thursday at the German Publishers & Booksellers Association in Berlin, where she lives, Ms.Muller, wearing all black and sitting on a leopard-print chair, appeared nervous with all the cameras flashing on her.          When asked what it meant that her name would now be mentioned in the same breath as German greats like Thomas Mann and Heinrich Boll, Ms.Muller remained philosophical."I am now nothing better and I'm nothing worse," she said, adding: "My inner thing is writing.That's what I can hold on to."          Earlier in the day, at a news conference in Stockholm, Peter England, secretary of the Swedish Academy, said Ms.Muller was honored for her "very, very distinct special language" and because "she has really a story to tell about cruelty and repression in a village much like the one Muller grew up in."          The awards ceremony is planned for Dec.10 in Stockholm.As the winner, Ms.Muller will receive about $1.4 million. By saying "I am now nothing better and I'm nothing worse", Ms.Muller meant that   _  .

Question 307/400:
A new report says more and more international students are attending colleges and universities in the United States. It also notes a large increase in the number of international students form China. These findings are from the latest edition  of the Open Doors Report.    The report tells the record number of international students in the United States during the 2011-2012 school year. It says more than 764,400 such students were attending American colleges and universities during that period. That means an increase of almost 6% compared to one year earlier. By comparison  ,the number of Americans who are studying overseas increased by 1%.    The report says 194,000 students at American colleges and universities are from China. That is an increase of more than 23% over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal is an assistant to the president of the Institute of International Education. She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America." We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world that they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their destination of choice." She says.    Chinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities . After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education. India has about 100,000 students in American schools. South Korea is third with about 70,000 students.    Why do so many foreign students study in the United States ? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason. " The advantage America has is that we have a huge system and a very diverse   system. So there are over four thousand universities and colleges in the United States, and what it tells us is that there is still a lot of room to contain international students." Why do so many students choose to study in America according to Peggy Blumenthal?
----------
  A: Because their education fees are low.
  B: Because their education quality is high.
  C: Because their education system is diverse and they can hold more students.
  D: Because America is the most developed country in the world.

Question 308/400:
Most people around the world are right-handed. This also seems to be true in history. In 1799, scientists studied works of art made at different times from 1,500 B.C. to the 1950s. Most of the people shown in these works are right-handed, so the scientists guessed that right-handedness has always been common through history. Today, only about 10% to 15% of the world's population is left-handed. Why are there more right-handed people than left-handed ones? Scientists now know that a person's two hands each have their own jobs. For most people, the hand is used to find things or hold things. The right hand is used to work with things. This is because of the different work of the two sides of the brain. The right side of the brain, which makes a person's hands and eyes work together, controls the left hand. The left-side of the brain, which controls the right hand, is the centre for thinking and doing problems. These findings show that more artists should be left-handed, and studies have found that left-handedness is twice as common among artists as among people in other jobs. No one really knows what makes a person become right-handed instead of left-handed. Scientists have found that almost 40% of the people become left-handed because their main brain is damaged when they are born. However, this doesn't happen to everyone, so scientists guess there must be another reason why people become left-handed. One idea is that people usually get right-handed from their parents. If a person does not receive the gene  for right-handedness, he / she may become either right-handed or left-handed according to the chance and the people they work or live with. Though right-handedness is more common than left-handedness, people no longer think left-handed people are strange or unusual. A long time ago, left-handed children were made to use their right hands like other children, but today they don't have to. What is the hand for most people used to do?
----------
  A: It's used to find or hold things.
  B: It's used to work with things.
  C: It's used to make a person's eyes work together.
  D: It's the centre for thinking and doing problems.

Question 309/400:
Professor Merrill, in a lecture in her psychology course at a private university, described an experiment in which a group of college students in a neighboring city rushed out and washed cars stopped at traffic lights during the rush hour. She described how people reacted differently with shock, joy, and surprise. At the conclusion of her report, she said, "You understand, of course, that you are not to undertake this or any other experiment unless you first clear it with me." Four of Merrill's students decided to try the same experiment but did not clear it with Merrill. One subject of their experiment, Carr, said, "I was shocked. There were two people on each side of the car. At first I thought negatively. I thought they were going to attack me and thought of driving away. Then I quieted down and decided there were too many dirty cars in the city anyway." Charitable immunity has been abolished in the jurisdiction. If Carr has a valid claim against the students, will he also prevail against the university?
----------
  A: Yes, if the students would not have performed the experiment but for Merrill's lecture. 
  B: Yes, if Carr's claim against the students is based on negligence. 
  C: No, because the students were not Merrill's employees. 
  D: No, because Merrill did not authorize the car wash as a class project

Question 311/400:
If you have a little child, who hates sitting in a car seat, then the FreedomRide is the answer to your problem. Would you want to be stuck in an unchangeable position every time you're in the car? No. You wouldn't. When an adult sits in a car for any length of time, we stretch, we change the position, we move our legs again and again. We do this without thinking. But kids in a traditional car seat can't do this. They are stuck in one position, and they can't move. We move because the circulation of blood needs to be recovered in our legs as we sit in the same position for any longer. In a traditional car seat, the child can't move to reduce the pain, so it puts them in anger. The FreedomRide lets them have a little freedom, and still be safe. The 5-Point Harness gives them additional safety over a traditional child car seat. I am the Webmaster for islandbreeze.com, and when JoeySafe asked us to redo their website, I was attracted by this system. That is because I have two small children, both girls, aged 3 and 4 and we obviously use car seats. I lived in Southern California, and every couple of months, my wife, the girls and I, go to see grandma who lives in Nevada. It's a 5-hour drive, so the FreedomRide works well. Our trips are so much better now, especially since there is more room in the car without the car seats. The FreedomRide really did make it easier to go on trips. The only thing you need when you use the JoeySafe instead of your old child car seat is a pillow. Besides, my kids want to take a pillow anyway! As a dad, I feel safe driving with the kids in the FreedomRide. I am a very safety-oriented person. From the text we can infer the FreedomRide is a   _  .

It's winter, and the weather is very cold. The children's mothers always take them to school with warm coats and hats and gloves . The children come into the classroom in the morning and take off their coats and hats and gloves, and put the gloves in the pockets of their coats. Last Tuesday, Miss Williams found two small blue gloves on the floor in the evening, and the next morning, she asked the children, "Whose gloves are these?" But no one answered. "Haven't you got blue gloves, Dick?" she asked him. "Yes, Miss Williams," he answered, "but those can't be mine. I've lost already." In winter, the children wore   coats and gloves to   _  .

Question 313/400:
About 90 percent of Chinese believe the polarization  between the rich and poor is "serious" in China, according to a survey conducted by China Youth Daily. And more than 80 percent of the respondents  surveyed said something must be done to narrow the expanding gap between the rich and poor, while 14.1 percent said it was necessary. The polarization has aroused wide concern among the public in recent years. The State Development and Reform Commission  said the _ had reached 0.47 for China, up from o.29 two decades ago. Usually, a country with a number above 0.4 is warned to pay attention to the income inequality problem. To find out the people's view, the survey covered 10,250 respondents, between the ages of 20 and 30 with a college education and a monthly salary between 1,000 and 3,000 yuan. Surprisingly, most disagreed with the view of experts who claim the urban-rural difference is causing the widening gap. More than 70 percent of the respondents believed that " the group of special interests" is the prime reason for the polarization, followed by "people in power" 68 percent, and "bosses" 50 percent. Another unexpected finding is that almost all agreed that a good educational background and knowledge were not the decisive factors in gaining wealth. About 95 percent said rich people are not necessarily those who are able to speak English or have a college education. Today in China, rich people , accounting for 10 percent of the population, control 45 percent of the total social fortune, and poor people, also 10 percent of the population, only control 1.5 percent, according to an investigation published by the National Bureau of Statistics last June. What's the best title of the passage?
----------

Question 315/400:
Some students who took the International English Language Testing System(IELTS) exam in August and September, 2015 have had their results"withheld  permanently", sending a strong signal that the examiners intend to stamp out cheating, some senior language tutors said. Yang Yuting, chief language training tutor at Amber Education, an overseas education consulting agency, said there have been a few cases in which candidates' IELTS results were canceled in recent years, leaving the students with no qualification but this is the first time he has heard that results, including those of some of his students, were"withheld permanently", meaning IELTS will not give the students their results, nor will they give them to others. Wang Xin, a senior student at the Communication University of China in Beijing, took an IELTS test on August 1 and the results were due within 10 working days. But she was then informed that her results were undergoing routine checks. Soon after that, she received an e-mail telling her that"a decision has been made to withhold this result permanently"and stating that Wang had"breached  IELTS test rules and regulations". A number of students who took the test during the past two months in cities including Nanjing, Changsha and Guangzhou, have had the same experience. Many test takers said they were confused because they didn't know how they had breached the rules and regulations. IELTS authorities said in an e-mail toChinaDailythat IELTS takes the responsibility of providing test results very seriously. Results are only withheld in cases where there is strong evidence to suggest that the candidates have not observed IELTS regulations."In these cases, we are unable to guarantee that their result is a true reflection of their English language skills,"they said in the e-mail, although they gave no figures of how many students were involved."We regret any inconvenience this may cause, but these measures are essential to protect the value of the results for more than 2.5 million test takers every year. Hundreds of thousands of people take IELTS in China every year and the number of results which are permanently withheld is a tiny proportion ,"they said. Hu Min, president ofNew Channel International Education Group, an English-language tutorial agency in China, said a major cause of results being withheld might be an extreme imbalance in performance levels in the four sections of the test."For example, if a student scores very high in the reading and listening sections while performing poorly in writing and speaking, IELTS authorities may suspect that the test taker has memorized the reading and listening questions -- a practice that is very popular among Chinese test takers,"he said."IELTS authorities discourage such a practice and would determine that the scores can't reflect the real English level if test takers do so." Students whose results were withheld were   .

Question 316/400:
One day, a boy said to a girl, "If I have only one bowl of gruel, I shall give one half to my mother, and the other half to you." The little girl liked the little boy from then on. That year he  was twelve and she was ten.     Ten years passed. When their village was flooded, he _ rescued others, including old people, children, the acquainted and the unacquainted, everyone except her in person. After she was rescued by others, somebody asked him, "Since you like her, why didn't you rescue her?" He answered gently, "It's just because I love her that I first rescued others. I would never live alone if she died." So they got married. That year he was twenty two and she was twenty. Later, the whole country suffered from famine. They also had few in the pot. Finally, only an ounce of noodles were left, and they cooked a bowl of noodles in soup. He was reluctant to eat and let her eat; she was reluctant to eat and let him eat! Three days later, the bowl of noodles went moldy. At that time, he was forty two and she was forty.  Since his grandfather was ever a landlord, he was criticized and denounced in public meetings. During those special years, the "Organization" asked her to "make clear the borderline and distinguish right and wrong", but she said, "I don't know who is the inner enemy, but I do know he is a good man. He loves me and I also love him. That's enough." That year he was fifty two and she was fifty. Many years passed, he and she began to practice Qigong in order to keep healthy. Because they were transferred to a town, every morning they took a bus to the city center park. When a young man offered his seat to them, each of them wouldn't take the seat because the other had to stand. Therefore, holding the handrail, they leaned each other with content smiles on their faces, and all of other passengers couldn't help standing up. That year he was seventy two and she was seventy.    She said, "When we were both dead ten years later, I must turn into him and he must turn into me, then he could drink the half bowl of gruel that I give him!" Seventy years of hardship life interprets this true love! really touches the author?

Question 317/400:
On August 4, while a young man in Hangzhou was caught because of killing another young man with his car, a 17-year-old girl died because of the same reason in the same city. It's reported that the driver was badly drunk. Cars are more and more popular for more Chinese these days. And the numbers of car accidents are increasing. From 1994 to 2008, deaths because of drunk-driving increased 7.3%. In 2009, a total of 18,371 people were killed in car accidents because of drunk driving. In the middle of August, there were some new rules to deal with the drunk drivers: 1. If a driver's alcohol content  is 20mg per 100 ml of blood, he is regarded as a drunk driver. 2. If a driver's alcohol content is 80mg per 100ml or more, he will be held  for 15 days and have their license revoked for six months, and are given a fine  of 2,000 yuan. The first weekend, 3,167 drivers were held because of high levels of alcohol in their blood.

Question 318/400:
In 1997, a group of twenty British women made history. Working in five teams with four women in each team, they walked to the North Pole. Apart from one experienced female guide, the other women were all ordinary people who had never done anything like this in their lives before. They managed to survive in an environment which had defeated several very experienced men during the same time period.               The women set off as soon as they were ready. Once on the ice, each woman had to ski along while dragging a sledge weighing over 50 kilos. The temperature was always below the freezing point and sometimes strong winds made walking while pulling so much weight almost impossible. It was also very difficult for them to put up their tents when they stopped each night. In such conditions, the women were making good progress if they covered fourteen or fifteen kilometers a day. But there was another problem. Part of the journey was across a frozen sea with moving water underneath the ice and at some points the team would drift back more than five kilometers during the night. That meant that after walking in these very severe conditions for ten hours on one day, they had to spend part of the next day covering the same ground again. Furthermore, each day it took three hours from waking up to setting off and another three hours every evening to set up the camp and prepare the evening meal.               So, how did they manage to succeed? They realized that they were part of a team. If any one  of them didn't pull her sledge or get her job done, she would endanger the success of the whole expedition.  Any form of selfishness could result in the efforts of everyone else being completely wasted, so personal Feelings had to be put on one side. At the end of their journey, the women agreed that it was mental effort far more than physical fitness that got them to the North Pole. Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the text?
----------
  A: Weather conditions.
  B: Protective clothing.
  C: Preparing food.
  D: Feelings and relationships.

Question 321/400:
Today there are 7 billion people on the earth.By the year 2050 there may be 9.0 billion.We will have a lot more people to feed.We need more food. One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic  material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural. They may feed people,then hurt them or their children later.But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use,and they are not going to die.In 2050 we may think differently about them. People plant the GM plants because  _

Question 322/400:
An American educational expert, Frederick M. Hess, says that a long summer vacation doesn't make sense in today's world. This summer, 50 million kids will spend much time talking online, watching TV, playing video games and asking older brothers or sisters to take them to the supermarket. They will also be putting their academic futures at risk. During much of the 20th century, many Americans worked in factories that did not need a college degree but still offered a high salary. Also, in the 19th century, there was no air condition. And poor hygiene   meant that crowded schools had health risks. Things have changed. For today's students, academic skills are key to future success. Many countries don't give kids an American-style summer vacation. They offer no more than seven consecutive   weeks of vacation. Most American school districts offer up to 13 weeks. To compete in global marketplace, Americans must be prepared to go up against international competitors. Summer vacation also causes challenges for today's families. In the 1960s, more than 60% of families had a stay-at-home mum. Now, two-thirds of American children live families where every adult works. For these families, summer vacation can be more burden than break. Someone must watch the kids. But the biggest problem may be how summer vacation hurts academic achievement. Scientist have found that disadvantaged students lose important ground in the summertime. A school year can allow time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons. Schools would have more time for sports, languages, music and the arts. How many reasons did the writer give to support his/her opinion?

Question 323/400:
Ogden was the fee simple owner of three adjoining vacant lots fronting on a common street in a primarily residential section of a city which had no zoning laws. The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. Ogden conveyed Lot 1 to Akers and Lot 2 to Bell. Ogden retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. Bell, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on his lot. Bell's house included a large window on the side facing Lot 3. The window provided a beautiful view from Bell's living room, thereby adding value to Bell's house. Akers erected a house on his lot. Ogden made no complaint to either Akers or Bell concerning the houses they built. After both Akers and Bell had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway was built on the line between the two houses so that one-half of the way was located on each lot. Akers and Bell exchanged right-of-way deeds by which each of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns, an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds were properly recorded. After Akers and Bell had lived in their respective houses for 30 years, a new public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots 1, 2, and 3. Akers informed Bell that, since the new street removed the need for their common driveway, he considered the right-of-way terminated; therefore, he intended to discontinue its use and expected Bell to do the same. At about the same time, Ogden began the erection of a six-story apartment house on Lot 3. If the apartment house is completed, it will block the view from Bell's window and will substantially reduce the value of Bell's lot."In an action brought by Bell to enjoin Ogden from erecting the apartment building in such a way as to obstruct the view from Bell's living room window, the decision should be for
----------
  A: Bell, because Ogden's proposed building would be an obstruction of Bell's natural right to an easement for light and air. 
  B: Bell, because Bell was misled by Ogden's failure to complain when Bell was building his house. 
  C: Ogden if, but only if, it can be shown that Ogden's intention to erect such a building was made known to Bell at or prior to the time of Ogden's conveyance to Bell. 
  D: Ogden, because Bell has no easement for light, air, or view.

Question 324/400:
Etymology, the study of words and word roots, may sound like the kind of thing done by boring librarians in small, dusty rooms.Yet etymologists actually have a uniquely interesting job.They are in many ways just like archaeologists   digging up the physical history of people and events.The special aspect of etymology is that it digs up history, so to speak, through the words and phrases that are left behind. The English language, in particular, is a great field to explore history through words. As a language, English has an extraordinary number of words.This is partly due to its ability to adapt foreign words so readily.For example, "English" words such as kindergarten (from German), croissant (from French), and cheetah (from Hindi) have become part of the language with little or no change from their original sounds and spellings. So English-language etymologists have a vast world of words to explore. Another enjoyable thing about etymology for most word experts is solving word mysteries .No, etymologists do not go around solving murders, like the great detective Sherlock Holmes.What these word experts solve are mysterious origins of some of our most common words One of the biggest questions English language experts have _ is how English came to have the phrase OK.Though it is one of the most commonly used expressions, its exact beginning is a puzzle even to this day.Even its spelling is not entirely consistent-unless you spell it Okay, it is hard even to call it a word. Etymologists have been able to narrow OK's origin down to a likely, although not certain, source .It became widely used around the time of Martin Van Buren's run for president in 1840. His nickname was Old Kinderhook. What troubles word experts about this explanation is that the phrase appeared in some newspapers before Van Buren became well known.It is likely that Van Buren could be called its primary source Etymologists will doubtlessly keep searching for the initial source.However, it is clear that OK's popularity and reputation have topped those of the American president to whom it has been most clearly linked. What is the main purpose of the passage?
----------
  A: To present the history of English words.
  B: To explain the procedure of an etymologist's job.
  C: To introduce the pleasure of the study of words and word roots.
  D: To teach readers how to distinguish English and non-English words

Question 326/400:
The Chinese Antarctica expedition returned to Shanghai on March 20 following a month living on the ice. It was the first time Chinese scientists had visited the Amery Ice Shelf--the longest ice shelf in the world. The team collected ice samples and data on temperatures, which are necessary for research on global warming. So far, about 27 countries have visited Antarctica for scientific research. Although the living conditions are very hard, many scientists have to stay there for long periods of time. So, how do they manage their lives on the ice? Well, during the summer, the temperature in Antarctica reaches about-20degC. It falls to about-60degCin winter. So, even if there are 24 hours of sunshine, scientists must keep wearing all the correct clothes to protect them from the cold. These clothes include jeans, running shoes, jackets, long underwears, boots and woolen socks. Although highly technical clothing provides much protection against the extreme cold, scientists often need to go outside when there is an icy wind blowing and the temperature is-30degC. Natural protection such as facial hair can also help. "That's why many researchers wear a beard. It really does keep you warm,"says German explorer Arved Fuchs. Usually, the polar researchers have good meals. Some even have feasts on holidays like Christmas and New Year's Day. Vegetables are always welcome and usually finished the quickest. Life on the ice means living with other researchers in tight living space. Most people sleep in dorm style rooms. More remote field camps use separate tents. So, at least some researchers don't have to _ annoying snorers . But what do they do for fun in their spare time?  There are actually a lot of things they can do. They watch movies, read tons of books, listen to music, have saunas ,paint and ski. Some female researchers might even do some knitting. It is important for a polar researcher to be in good physical condition. They can be required to climb to heights of more than 3, 000 meters. And the Antarctic atmosphere has less oxygen than that of any other continent. Why do some polar researchers wear beards? Because   _  .
----------
  A: they have no time to shave their beards
  B: beards are helpful to keep warm
  C: beards will come out soon when they are shaved
  D: they think beards will make them look handsome

Question 327/400:
While reading a story on 20-somethings complaining about how the economy is ruining their life plans, I couldn't help but think the 20-somethings sound like a bunch of spoiled children who grow up expecting everything to be easy for them. As a 20-something myself, I certainly share their disappointment -my husband and I probably won't be able to buy a house until we're in our forties, and we two are burdened by student loans. But why should it be different? Being young people in America, shouldn't they take up all of the challenges and opportunities that this country offers? Consider some of these views shared in the story: Jennifer, 29, owner of a two-bedroom apartment with her husband, worries that she won't be able to have children for at least a decade because they can't afford to buy a house yet. I read that, and I thought what planet she is living on where you need to own a house in order to have kids? Has she ever visited a developing country, or even downtown areas in this one? Home ownership is a luxury, not a fertility requirement. A 26-year-old man in the story is disappointed that he can't afford to get a Ph. D. in literature. Well, that sounds a bit like expressing disappointment that no one will pay you to write poetry on the beach in Thailand for five years. Yes, it's sad that these young people feel so lost. But I think the problem is their extremely high expectations, not economic reality. Beth Kobliner, author of Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties, says that she thinks people's expectations grow up when their wealth appears to be increasing. Their parents probably see their home values rise along with their investments. "So we have people who have grown up in an environment where people have great expectations of what living well means," says Kobliner. This recession will certainly play a role in forcing those expectations into more realistic group. In the meantime, it seems much better for our mental health to focus on being grateful--for our one-bedroom apartments, for living in modern cities, or perhaps just for being able to eat three meals a day--than on longing for some kind of luxurious life. Which of the following is NOT one of the complaints of the 20-somethings?
----------
  A: They can't have children for at least a decade for they can't afford to buy a house.
  B: They have only a one-bedroom apartment to live in.
  C: They can't buy a house until 40 and are burdened by student loans.
  D: in literature.

Question 328/400:
For an increasing number of students at American universities, Old is suddenly in. The reason is obvious: the graying of America means jobs. Coupled with the aging of the baby-boom   generation, a longer life span  means that the nation's elderly population is bound to expand significantly over the next 50 years. By 2050, 25 percent of all Americans will be older than 65, up from 14 percent in 1995. The change brings many problems for government and society, of course. But it also creates career opportunities in medicine and health professions,  and in law and business as well. "In addition to the doctors, we're going to need more sociologists, biologists, urban planners and specialized lawyers," says Professor Edward Schneider of the University of Southern California's (USC) School of Gerontology  .www.zxxk.com Lawyers can specialize in "elder law" which covers everything from trusts  and estates to nursing-home abuse and age discrimination. Businessmen see huge opportunities in the elder market because the baby boomers, 74 million strong, are likely to be the wealthiest group of retirees  in human history. "Any student who combines an expert knowledge in gerontology with, say, an MBA or law degree will have a license to print money," one professor says. Margarite Santos is a 21-year-old senior at USC. She began college as a biology major but found she was "really bored with bacteria." So she took a class in gerontology and discovered that she liked it. She says, "I did volunteer work in retirement homes and it was very satisfying." Why can businessmen make money in the emerging elder market?
----------
  A: The elderly possess an enormous purchasing power
  B: They can employ more gerontologists
  C: Retirees are more generous in spending money
  D: There are more elderly people working than before

Question 329/400:
I met my step-mom for the first time when I moved to America to be reunited with my father. From the beginning she made sure to let me know that I was safe and welcome.  I remember when I first saw her at the airport. It was different but not uncomfortable. After I was picked up from the airport we went home and she unpacked my luggage. Then she took me shopping for new clothes since the ones I had brought with me from Africa were a bit worn. That night before I went to bed she came to my room, which was the first room I had ever had for my own, with the first bed I didn't have to share. She told me she was glad to have me and that she would take good care of me. Before she walked out of my new room, she asked me for a hug. I had no idea what she was talking about. I did not know what the word hug meant, not because I didn't speak English, but I had just never heard the word before, let alone knew what it meant. So, I just looked at her with a questioning expression on my face. But she didn't give up. She called my father into the room and asked him to explain to me what she meant. When my father was explaining I looked at her and wondered why she wanted to hug me. She then told me it was because she loved me and opened her arms wide. Shyly I opened mine and we hugged. That was my very first hug and I was 11 at that time. I'm 23 now and, thankfully, I have received many hugs since then. I consider her my birth mother because life began when I came to stay with her. For the first time there were no kids for me to take care of and I became a child for the first time. There was no work waiting for me every day other than the occasional chores that she gave me to teach me responsibility.  Today I say thank-you to my mother; thank you for giving me my childhood back after it had been taken away from me. I am who I am today because of your love! What was the author's life in Africa?
----------
  A: Difficult.
  B: Amusing.

Question 331/400:
More and more people are aware that an afternoon nap  can do a body good. But there are still doubters out there. To help spread the power of the afternoon nap, we list some common misunderstandings about napping we still hear. Misunderstanding # 1 : Napping is only for the lazy. Fact: Around a third of American adults nap on the average day, and for good reason: A short nap can improve everything from alertness  and memory to creativity and productivity . And none of these sounds like laziness to us! Misunderstanding # 2 : If I take a nap, I'll only wake up feeling worse. Fact: That weak feeling after you wake up from a nap is real (it even has a name: sleep inertia), but it's not a guarantee . How you feel after your nap is a factor of how long you sleep. Experts generally agree that a nap should last no longer than 30 minutes. "If it takes longer than 30 minutes, you end up in deep sleep. You're going into a stage of sleep where you find it very difficult to wake up." said sleep expert Michael J. Breus, Ph. D. Next time you're in the mood for a nap, set your alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, tops. Misunderstanding # 3 : You mustn't nap at work. Fact: In fact, in the office environment, we're all for catching a few winks   during the workday. Some companies have even created special rooms for afternoon naps as more and more employers come around to the idea that a well-rested workforce is a more productive workforce. If your employer doesn't offer a place to lay your head, try to find an empty conference room where you can close the door and turn off the lights. Really want. You can also take a nap during your lunch break on a park bench or in your car. Misunderstanding # 4 : I'll be more productive if I just finish this task, rather than waste time sleeping. Fact: Yes, you'll be away from your desk if you spend 10 to 30 minutes sleeping. But you'll likely make up for that "wasted" time afterward. "My research shows that people feel tired after a long time of work during the day," Sara Mednick told Bloomberg Businessweek. "It's difficult to keep energetic and productive all day." However, a nap can leave you feeling refreshed and more ready to deal with the task at hand. According to the passage, a short nap has the following benefits EXCEPT  _  .
----------
  A: making people think more quickly
  B: improving people's memory
  C: allowing old people to live longer
  D: raising people's work efficiency

Question 332/400:
A young man returns to his hometown of Aractataca, Colombia. He visits the house where he lived as a child. Here, he remembers the most important memories of his childhood. Standing in front of his old house, the young man makes an important decision. He says to himself, "I will start my life over again. I will become a writer." This man is the world famous writer, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Gabriel Garcia Marquez was born on March 6, 1928. During his early life, Garcia Marquez's grandmother and grandfather told him many stories. His grandmother would tell him legends as if they were real. Garcia Marquez says that his grandmother's way of storytelling later influenced his own methods. When Garcia Marquez was about 20 years old, he left Aractataca and attended university in Bogota. He began studying law because this was what his father wanted him to study. However, Garcia Marquez was not happy. During this time Garcia Marquez returned to Aractataca. It was on this visit that he realized he must stop studying law. And he recognized that he must return to the dream of his childhood-writing. For the next few years, Garcia Marquez wrote for many different newspapers. And in 1955, he published his first book called "Leaf Storm". For many years, Garcia Marquez knew he wanted to write about his grandfather's house in Aractataca. To write this book, Garcia Marquez and his wife had to sell almost all of their possessions to survive. But their act was worth it. The book, "One Hundred Years of Solitude" was immediately successful. And this book created a path for Garcia Marquez's future success. In 1982, Gabriel Garcia Marquez was given the Nobel Prize in Literature for his book "One Hundred Years of Solitude", making him the first Colombian and the fourth Latin American to win a Nobel Prize in Literature. What do we know from the text about Garcia Marquez?
----------
  A: He is the first Latin American to win a Nobel Prize in Literature.
  B: He wrote for newspapers before publishing his own books.
  C: His book "Leaf Storm" marked his great success in literature.

Question 333/400:
Although I didn't have any interest in being a school bus driver, I became one. Many years later, I was still working on the school bus. There are so many good reasons. Firstly, the talk brought me different kinds of information. I also got to hear all the family secrets of the newcomers. I have a toy bear who was a great comforter  for the little ones. The kids got to look after him on the trip to school and he waited patiently for _ to get on for the trip home. Our bus would often pass a place where we could see some alpacas   in front of a farm house. Little Michael would cry excitedly from the seat, "Look, Miss! Look at the camels!" He used to put his head out of the bus window. When I warned him that a little insect would come into his nose if he wasn't careful, he smartly gave up the habit. I remember a little girl got on the bus one morning 5 years ago and sobbed  all the way to school. We arrived at the school gate. As she waited to get down the bus, she threw her arms around my neck and cried that her grandfather had died the night before. A school bus driver needs to keep one eye on the road and the other on the mirror to watch what the little ones are doing down the back. Now, it's important to think how many lives I've been responsible  for, and how many kilometers I've driven in order to get my passengers home safely during the 20 years. I've enjoyed it, but it's time to rest and park my school bus. Which of the following is TRUE?
----------
  A: Children didn't like the driver.
  B: The driver likes the job all the time.
  C: The little girl was excited at seeing the camels.
  D: Children sometimes talked about their family secrets on the bus.

Question 334/400:
When I was born, my parents immediately noticed something wrong. My feet were deformed  , pointing inward and curling under. I wore casts   and foot braces   in my first two years to correct the problem. Yet I learned to balance and walk in casts. Soon after the last set of casts came off,Mom enrolled me in dance classes as therapy for my feet. I, however,quickly decided to try something else. Not far from my house was an ice rink   in the mall. There,local skaters would perform ice shows. I wanted to try skating. I started taking group skating lessons. Performing on ice came naturally. For me,skating has never been about beating others. It's been about being my personal best. I progressed through various levels rapidly and gave my first ice performance at age seven. Soon I started winning local and regional competitions. That's because being on the ice has always been the one place I can truly express my emotions. _  I began seriously training when I was nine years old. After graduating from girls' high school,I moved to Canada. Saying goodbye to my family and friends made me homesick,but I knew deep down that I had to leave and train full-time to give my dreams a chance at reality. I went to compete in the Olympic Games in 1992.I was the first of the final six skaters on the ice. My long performance started well,but I slipped while landing one of my easiest triple jumps,and my hand touched the ice. I didn't want to make two mistakes in a row,so next I did a jump with just two spins to play it safe. As I neared the end,I had one more jump. I landed it perfectly. When medals were awarded,I found myself on the top step,the gold hanging around my neck and America's national anthem playing. Words can't describe the overwhelming mixture of emotions I felt. When the author says "The ice is like home",she really means she  _  .
----------
  A: can express herself through her performance on ice
  B: can beat others in local and regional competitions
  C: can overcome her difficulty in walking
  D: has realized her dream to perform on ice

Question 336/400:
A weather map is an important tool for geographers.   A succession of three or four maps presents continuous picture of weather changes. Weather forecasters are able to determine the speed of air masses and fronts   to determine whether an individual pressure aroa is deepening or becoming shallow and whether a front is increasing or decreasing in intensity  .They are also able to determine whether an air mass is retaining its original characteristics or taking on those of the surface over which it is moving. Thus, a most significant function of the map is to reveal a summary picture of conditions in the atmosphere at a given time. All students of geography should be able to interpret a weather map accurately.Weather maps contain an enormous amount of information about weather conditions existing at the time of observation over a large geographical area. They reveal in a few minutes what otherwise would take hours to describe. The United States  Weather Bureau issues information about approaching storms, floods, frosts and all climatic conditions in general. Twice a month it issues a 30-day"outlook" which is a rough guide to weather conditions likely to occur over broad areas of the United States. These 30-day outlooks are based upon an anaiysis of the upper air levels which often set the stage for development of air masses, fronts and storms. Considerable effort is being exerted today to achieve more accurate weather predictions, with identifying and tracking storms over regions which have but few meteorological  stations. Extensive experiments are also in progress for weathef modification studies. The thirty-day forecast is determined by examining  _  .
----------
  A: daily weather maps
  B: upper air levels
  C: satellite reports

Question 339/400:
I'm telling Mother about a new girl in school,and she suddenly looks up and says,"Who're your two best friends?" I'm not sure what to say.I've been friends with Jill since I was three or so,and I really like Jaime,a friend in kindergarten."Well,what about Karen and Cindy?" She seems upset,like I hurt her feelings."But they're my sisters." "Yes,but they can still be your best friends.Friends may come and go,but your sisters will always be there for you." At the time,the idea of my two sisters being my closest friends seemed strange to me.We fought all the time over toys,food and attention.How could my sisters be my best friends?They weren't the same age as I.We all had our own friends in school.But my mother never let the three of us forget it:Sisters are lifelong friends.Her wish was to give us something that she never had.Growing up an only child,she longed for siblings  .When she gave birth to three daughters,the fulfillment of her dream had only just begun.She'd given us each a gift and she wanted to make sure we did not take that gift for granted.She'd frequently tell us how lucky we were.She never showed favoritism to one daughter over the other.And when we were teenagers,Mom always punished us equally. We didn't always get along beautifully and fought just like any other siblings.But we realized that our mother was right.Today I share things with my sisters that I do with no one else.My sister Cindy and I ran the New York City Marathon together,sidebyside,even holding hands when we crossed the finish line.When my sister Karen got married,I was her maid of honor.The three of us trust each other with our greatest secrets. It was twentythree years ago that my mother first asked me who my two best friends were.Today she doesn't have to.She already knows. Why does Mother say that my sisters can be my best friends?
----------
  A: Because we fight over toys,food and attention.
  B: Because my sisters are the same age as I.
  C: Because my sisters will always be there for me.
  D: Because we are always punished by Mother equally.

Question 340/400:
Peanuts to This Proudly reading my words,I glanced around the room,only to find my classmates bearing big smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes.Confused,I glanced toward my stonefaced teacher.Having no choice,I slowly raised the report I had slaved over,hoping to hide myself."What could be causing everyone to act this way?" Quickly,I flashed back to the day Miss Lancelot gave me the task.This was the first real task I received in my new school.It seemed simple:go on the Internet and find information about a man named George Washington.Since my idea of history came from an ancient teacher in my home country,I had never heard of that name before.As I searched the name of this fellow,it became evident that there were two people bearing the same name who looked completely different!One invented hundreds of uses for peanuts,while the other led some sort of army across America.I stared at the screen,wondering which one my teacher meant.I called my grandfather for a golden piece of advice:flip  a coin.Heads--the commander,and tails--the peanut guy.Ah!Tails,my report would be about the great man who invented peanut butter,George Washington Carver. Weeks later,standing before this unfriendly mass,I was totally lost.Oh well,I lowered the paper and sat down at my desk, _ to find out what I had done wrong.As a classmate began his report,it all became clear,"My report is on George Washington,the man who started the American Revolution."The whole world became quiet!How could I know that she meant that George Washington? Obviously,my grade was awful.Heartbroken but fearless,I decided to turn this around.I talked to Miss Lancelot,but she insisted:No redos;no new grade.I felt that the punishment was not justified,and I believed I deserved a second chance.Consequently,I threw myself heartily into my work for the rest of the school year.Ten months later,that chance unfolded as I found myself sitting in the headmaster's office with my grandfather,now having an entirely different conversation.I smiled and flashed back to the embarrassing moment at the beginning of the year as the headmaster informed me of my option to skip the sixth grade.Justice is sweet!       (2012*,B) What did the author's classmates think about his report?
----------
  A: Controversial.
  B: Ridiculous.
  C: Boring.
  D: Puzzling.

Question 341/400:
Taj Mahal, Agra, India As many as 28 different varieties of semi-precious and precious stones were used to decorate the outside of the Taj Mahal. Construction of the Taj Mahal took around 20 years. The building, which was made from white marble from the quarries  of Rajasthan, appears pink in the morning, white in the day and golden in the moonlight. Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, Japan It took 10 years to construct the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge. It connects the city of Kobe, on Japan's mainland, with Iwaya on Awaji Island. Before it opened, the only way to get between the two cities was ferry. However, the waterway was prone to   severe storms and when two ferries capsized   in 1955, killing 168 people, public anger convinced   the government of the need for a bridge. It's the longest suspension   bridge in the world, with a length of 1,991 meters. Panama Canal, Panama More than 4.5 million cubic yards of concrete were used in the construction of this canal's locks and dams. The Panama Canal is a 77-kilometer (47-mile) long waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The earth and rubble excavated   to make way for it was enough to bury Manhattan to a depth of four meters. A series of locks allow ships to pass through the water; each of the moveable lock doors weighs 750 tons and each of the locks fills with 52 million gallons of water to accommodate the 15,000 ships that use the canal every year. Completion date: January 7, 1914 after 10 years of building. Grand Canyon Skywalk, Arizona, America The Skywalk's foundation is strong enough to support 71 million pounds. Located 1, 219 meters above the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon's Skywalk consists of one million pounds of steel and 83,000 pounds of glass. It was the creation of Las Vegas businessman David Jin, who approached the Hualapai Tribe with the idea of a glass walkway over the Grand Canyon in 1996. The Skywalk was assembled   on site. Completion date: March 28, 2007. In which section of a book can the passage probably be seen?

Question 343/400:
Several years ago Robert knew a girl at a party. He loved her at once. But he hadn't enough money to marry her. He went to another village and wanted to borrow five thousand dollars from Peter, one of his classmates. He said he was going to return the money in two years. Peter Black believed him and lent the money to him. And Robert thanked the young man very much. In the past four years Robert married the girl and she had a baby. They lived a happy life, but he didn't give the money back to Peter. One day Peter's mother was ill and needed an operation. He looked for Robert for a few times, but he never met him. One day Peter heard that the young man was in. He hurried there. He knocked at the door for a long time and Robert's wife came out to meet him. "I'm sorry, Mr. Black." said the woman. "My husband has just gone out." Peter thought for a while and said, "Yes, I met him on my way here. He told me that he had left all his money at home and let you return it to me." "Don't believe him, dear!" Robert came out in a hurry  and called out. "I've never told him about it!" Which of the following is true?   _  .
----------
  A: The woman didn't know her husband was at home.

Question 344/400:
"When I grow up, I want to be..." Almost all of us have thought about, or been asked to think about, our future careers. Our answers may differ greatly. Even now your aspirations may have changed from when you were in primary school. However, it seems career options aren't only based on personal taste. In a survey carried out by Teens, doctors, lawyers, and bankers were some of most popular careers that people said they hoped to follow. This is in line with a similar survey carried out in the UK in May 2011 by job website monster. Co.uk, in which medicine was the top choice among UK teenagers aged between 13 and 17. Medicine and law are two of the oldest and best known professions. Their prestige   may come from the fact that doctors and lawyers are some of the most esteemed members of society, and they make good money. Joining these high-profile professions is often seen as a sign of upward social mobility. It is equally unsurprising that banking is now one of the most common career choices. Youngsters worldwide think of banking and see the money rolling in. Wealth is increasingly becoming one of the most important indicators of a successful career. British young men list the UK tycoon Alan Sugar, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg as their top role models "for their wealth". Just as Chinese teenagers see being a banker as a good and fun pathway to "wealth". However, not every child has the makings of doctor, lawyer, or banker. They are those who see fulfillment and happiness in other areas, and many teenagers dare to ink more individuality into their career options. As the Teens' survey discovered, a variety of unconventional jobs---coffee shop owner, gourmet ,waiter at a fast food restaurant---are among teenagers' career choices. They can be equally interesting and rewarding jobs. With every choice comes responsibility and challenge, and all career paths require specific education and training, you have to learn to balance optimism and confidence with being realistic about your particular talents and skills. What is the passage mainly about?
----------
  A: Careers in teenagers' mind.
  B: Choosing a good job is very important.
  C: Teenagers in the UK like doctors.
  D: The choice of career needs challenge.

Question 346/400:
Sally was a student. It was going to be her mother's birthday. She wanted to buy her a present that would be nice and useful but not expensive. A week before her mother's birthday, she went shopping after a quick and simple lunch. When she had been looking for half an hour, she found a shop that was selling cheep umbrellas , and decided to take a black one, since her mother had lost hers the month before. She thought, "You could carry that when you are wearing clothes of any color." So she decided to buy a lovely black umbrella and took it back to school with her until her classes had finished. On her way back home in the train that evening, she felt hungry because she had such a small lunch that she went along to the buffet car  for another sandwich and cup of coffee. She had left the black umbrella above her seat in the compartment , but when she got back, it had gone! When she had left the compartment, there had been no other passengers  in it, but now there were three. Sally began to cry when she saw that the umbrella was no longer there. The other passengers felt very sorry for her and asked what the matter was. She told them that the black umbrella she had bought for her mother was gone, and that she had to get out at the next station. After the three other passengers heard it, they asked her for her mother's address so that they could sent the umbrella to her if someone had taken it by mistake and brought it back after Sally had got out of the train. The next week, Sally heard from her mother. It said, "Thank you very much for your lovely presents, but why did you send me three black umbrellas?" How many umbrellas did Sally's mother get at last?
----------
  A: No.
  B: Only one.
  C: Three.
  D: Four.

But a new one starts right away. How exciting! This is street-ball. It's much like basketball. But it's faster. People play it outside and it's interesting. Usually, children play street-ball on an open court. They use only half of the court. What they need is a basketball goal  . Children love lots of things about the game. "It's very nice to be outside in the sun. And the music is great", said Jane, fourteen, a girl in Beijing. Some say street-ball was from Europe  , others say it came from America. But now, boys and girls in many countries like to play it. Street-ball is a game for all. Street-ball is much like   _  .

Question 348/400:
Most recently, it's very common in students who need a parent present for job interviews. Naturally, it's easy to blame the students in these situations, but the bigger problem is us. We--as parents--are so eager to shelter our kids that we fail to realize that this in itself is harming them.As the mother of two young sons, I have to remind myself constantly that the biggest responsibility I have as a parent is to help them develop the skills needed to live in, to live without me.So, I'll let them fail. I'll let them fail because as long as they are safe and warm inside their comfort zones, they will never grow.And failure -- along with loss, heartbreak, disappointment, etc.-- will be part of growth for them.Call me the anti-tiger mom, but leaving them alone, is my way of helping them become equipped to fit in this world as we know it today.From terrorism and seemingly endless natural disasters, to our national debt and beyond, if we expect the next generation to stand up to the very real problems of our time, we need to stop feeding them and start teaching them how to fish. My children now are becoming little masters of compromise, but they try to negotiate   everything now.It's a small price to help them learn a skill they'll use for the rest of their lives, including when I don't accompany them on job interviews. Why do parents accompany their kids on job interviews?
----------
  A: Because they want to protect their kids from difficulties.
  B: Because they think they can help them on the questions.
  C: Because their kids are too shy to attend interviews.
  D: Because their kids strongly request them to do so.

Question 349/400:
Packaging is an important form of advertising.A package can sometimes _ someone to buy a product.For example, a small child might ask for a breakfast food that comes in a box with a picture of a TV character.The child is more interested in the picture than in breakfast food.Pictures for children to color or cut out, games printed on a package, or a small gift inside a box also motivate many children to buy products or to ask their parents to buy for them. Some packages suggest that a buyer will get something for nothing.Food products sold in reusable containers are examples of this.Although a similar product in a plain container might cost less, people often prefer to buy the product in a reusable glass or dish, because they believe the container is free.However, the cost of the container is added to the cost of the product.The size of a package also motivates a buyer.Maybe the package had "Economy Size" or "Family Size" printed on it.This suggests that the larger size has the most product for the least money.But that is not always true.To find it out, a buyer has to know how the product is sold and the price of the basic unit. The information on the package should provide some answers.But the important thing for any buyer to remember is that a package is often an advertisement.The words and pictures do not tell the whole story.Only the product inside can do that. What is the best title for the passage?
----------
  A: How to Package a Product.
  B: How to Make an Advertisement.
  C: How to Sell Product.
  D: How to Treat the Package Wisely.

Question 350/400:
Enjoying a better life at school, with shorter class hours, greater privacy and more rights is all you dream of, right? For students in Shanghai, they are no longer just dreams. This week experts and law-makers in Shanghai had a meeting to talk about a new law . It is called the "Shanghai Underage Protection Law ". The law says students' diaries and letters are their secrets and "Nobody can read them if they don't agree." Do your teachers sometimes say something bad to you? Maybe they send you out of the classroom because you fail to finish doing your homework. If this happens in Shanghai, you can stand up and say "No". Shanghai students may have less homework because of the law. Class hours may become shorter for juniors next year, down from 45 minutes to 40 minutes in some schools. The law also talks about students' health. According to the rules,"Smoking in these places full of kids is not allowed."That means you can ask your teacher to stop if he smokes in a classroom. The law makes schools safer for students. "No dancing halls, Internet bars or computer game bars are allowed within(......)200 meters of a school gate." the law says. The law is great, right? Many students like it. "My mom reads my diaries sometimes. I think she will be afraid if I tell her she is doing something against the law." said Luo Jia, 13, at Shanghai Fuxing Junior School. If you want to know more about the law, go to "www.spcsc.sh.cn". ,. If your teacher smokes in a classroom, you can   _  .

Question 352/400:
Sitting at a desk in a classroom all day can be pretty boring. The teachers at Ward Elementary in Winston -Salem,North Carolina ,picked up on that and traded in their students' desks for exercise bikes as a part of their Read and Ride program! The Read and Ride program began five years ago.One classroom has enough bikes for every student in any given class,and throughout the day teachers bring in their students to the room to ride them and read their books. Even regular classrooms have one bike in the back of each room for students who just can't sit still to use to help them burn energy in a good way. Students love being more active! Teachers enjoy seeing students eager to read.Parents appreciate stronger,smarter children.Headmasters value this effective and cost-free program."Riding exercise bikes makes reading fun for many kids who get frustrated when they read.Thus,they have a way to release that frustration while they ride,"said Scott Ertl,who started the program."As we can see,everyone wants to promote literacy and lose weight! But many students who are overweight struggle with sports and activities since they don't want to always be the last or lose with others watching on the playground.On exercise bikes,however,students are able to exert themselves at their own level--without anyone noticing when they slow down or take a break." As it turns out,not only are the bikes helping the students burn calories,they're also helping them learn better and stay focused.At the end of the school year the school analyzed testing data and found that students that spent more time reading and riding did more than twice as well on reading tests than their fellow students who spent the least time in the program. Why did the teachers start the Read and Ride program?
----------
  A: To get the students out of the classrooms.
  B: To make the students more active in sports.
  C: To read effectively in an active way.
  D: To help the overweight students keep fit.

Question 354/400:
Today, innovations  to make our lives more eco-friendly can be found everywhere. There are energy-efficient automobiles, eco-friendly light bulbs, and clothes made by fashion designers using sustainable  environmental practices. Industries around the world have also begun to take a serious look at how their operations affect the local and global environment.  The university of Colorado has been named one of the top green colleges and universities in the United States. This university was one of the first to start a student-led recycling program in the 1970s and today supplies students with reusable shopping bags to use both on and off campus. The entire University of Colorado also uses low flow water fixtures  and has reduced water usage by 40 percent since 2002.  When it comes to going green, Warren Wilson College has been recognized in many places. The Sierra Club and The Princeton Review have named the college as one of America's greenest colleges and universities, while the school has also received the Outstanding College Recycling Award from the Carolina Recycling Association, as well as awards from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education(AASHE). For a small college, Warren Wilson has made enormous efforts to be an eco-friendly campus since its beginning, and today owns a campus farm, a seeding program, and an extensive recycling program. Warren Wilson was also the first College to have an LEED platinum certified  residence hall, and its building services department is also 100 percent GreenSeal certified. According to College Stats, Warren Wilson College is one of the first institutions in the United States to be almost completely self-sufficient  while also engaging students to incorporate sustainability into all academic programs.  Going green efforts at Oberlin College have not gone unnoticed. Oberlin College spends 22 percent of its food budget on buying food from local farmers, with most of the food raised or harvested with organic and sustainable practices. Oberlin has also stopped selling bottled water on campus and offers discounts to students who use their own storage containers when purchasing beverages and food items. Among Oberlin's other eco-friendly accomplishments is a green graduation ceremony, which includes programs printed on 100 percent recycled paper. What do we know about the University of Colorado?
----------
  A: Its recycling program is followed by other universities.
  B: It produces reusable shopping bags by itself.
  C: It uses special systems to save water.
  D: It is the most eco-friendly university.

Languages are always changing.As time goes by,some new words are created and becoming more and more popular.Search on Baidu,and you can find some hot net words in China today. "Tuhao",a Chinese word,which originally meant a rich and powerful person or family in a certain town or area,nowadays,has become a general term used by people to describe those who look really rich,and especially those who live beyond their means. The term"dama"is almost the same as"big mama'in Chinese.referring to those middle-aged Chinese women who crazily bought gold in jewelry shops in HK.

Question 356/400:
The early history of the city of Rome involves Romulus and Remus,two orphan boys who,legend says,were raised by a she-wolf.The boys' mother had been murdered by an evil king and the two babies tossed into the river Tiber.When the wolf found them they had washed up on the shore.She perhaps took pity on the crying of the babies and,gently picking them up in her teeth,she carried them back to her cave and fed them on her milk.The boys grew bigger and stronger and,eventually,were found by a herdsman who took them home.He and his wife raised the boys like their own children.When they reached manhood they sought revenge on the king who had killed their mother and driven them from their home.

Question 357/400:
I was in the park with my elder sister, Cathy, on Friday. My sister left her jacket on a chair while we talked to some friends. When we went back to the chair, a girl in a red T-shirt was sitting there. She had some money in her hand. When she saw us, she stood up and walked away. I asked my sister, "Did you have any money in your jacket?" She said, "Yes, Anna, I did." I said, "Look in your jacket quickly." Cathy looked in her jacket, but her money was not there. "That girl stole it!" I said, and we both ran after her. We caught her quickly. My sister was very angry and she said, "Give me the money." The girl gave the money to Cathy and ran away. We both ran after her, but we lost her. Then we went home. But before we could tell our parents, my mother said to Cathy, "You left your money at home. It's on the table in the sitting room. You must be more careful with money." So the girl in the red T-shirt was not a thief! She probably thought we were thieves! We felt terrible. Please telephone us if you know this girl! We are very sorry for our mistake. We would like to say sorry to her and give the money back to her. Our number is 512667. My name is Anna. The two sisters found that the money wasn't Cathy's  _  .

Question 359/400:
Air pollution levels were literally off the charts  in Beijing over the weekend, reportedly reducing visibility  to about 100 yards in some areas. The air has been classified hazardous to human health for many days, at its worst hitting pollution levels 25 times that considered safe in the U. S. The entire city is blanketed  in a thick grey smog, leading to official warnings to stay inside. At least four deaths have been blamed on what Chinese media calls the "smoggy weather"--including two high school students who were hit by a train due to low visibility. The smog has affected more than 30 cities in China. The air quality is so bad--some foreigners in China have been referring to it on social media as the "Airpocalypse "--that government media have been joining Internet users in questioning China's rapid path to economic growth. Unusually, the pollution is getting headline treatment on local news bulletins and in the domestic  media. Since the beginning of the year, the government has been releasing hourly pollution readings for 74 Chinese cities, almost half of which are now showing severe pollution. In the Chinese media, there's been some soul-searching  about why the problem has been so serious. The China Daily took the country's rapid urbanization  process to task , commenting in an editorial, "The air quality in big cities could have been better had more attention been paid to the density  of high rises, had more trees been planted in proportion  to the number of residential areas, and had the number of cars been strictly controlled." Meanwhile, the Global Tunes has been pointing out China's role as the global factory and the "biggest construction site in the world." The Los Angeles Times reports fuel, standards in China allow for three times the amount of poisonous sulfur  as in the United States, and five times as much compared to European standards. Which of the following belongs to the soul-searching about the air pollution done by China Daily?
----------
  A: The quality of the fuel used in the cars, trucks and other vehicles.
  B: China's expanding economy and falling rates of personal income.
  C: Taking official cars off the road as many as possible.
  D: Keeping the role of the global factory.

Question 362/400:
Japanese workers who run secretly out of the office and spend their afternoons hanging around coffee shops may soon be caught out by their bosses. A new cellphonebased tracking device from Hitachi can show, on an employer's computer screen, not only the whereabouts of their workers but also whether they are standing, walking, running--or have fallen over. The system, called Partout, was originally developed as a monitoring device for the families of people with dementia, who may wander off and need to be located. "It's estimated that the number of elderly people with symptoms of dementia will reach 1.5 million in Japan next year," says Hitachi's Keisaku Shibatani. But the high cost of the system--early prices are around PS27,000--has put it out of reach of most families. Indeed, companies with large sales forces and police departments who want to track officers on dangerous patrol duties are interested in the system. Partout uses a multifunction location sensing unit that tracks users through global positioning satellites. The user's body motion is determined by an accelerometer inside the sensing unit: no movement means the subject has stopped, slow movement means they are walking, fast movement means they are running, and strong and unexpectedly sudden movement means the user may have fallen. The date is relayed through the user's cell phone to computer, which displays their position on a map. Graphics record the motion or position of the subject's body. What would be the best title for the text?
----------
  A: You Can Run, but You Can't Hide
  B: New Cell phones in Need
  C: The Future of Cell phones

Question 363/400:
FOR people who are interested in space, nothing is more exciting than the idea of living on other planets. That might be why the movie The Martian (<<>> ) is so popular. It shows an astronaut struggling to live on Mars. But would it actually be possible to live on the Red Planet? While the idea of living on Mars is great, the reality does not look as good. Mars does not have a friendly atmosphere for humans. There is very little oxygen there. And because of its distance from the sun, it is also very cold. The temperature on Mars can be -62 degrees on average. This is much too cold for humans. However, scientists say it might be possible to live there even without a good atmosphere. Daytime on Mars is almost the same as Earth's. It means there's enough sunlight to grow plants inside safe buildings. However, they would have to grow in soil from Earth. Mars does not have a strong enough atmosphere to stop the radiation coming from space, which makes it dangerous to grow things in the soil. The radiation is also bad for our health. If we want to live there healthily, we need to build our homes under the ground or within the rocks on the planet. This would protect humans from the radiation and also some heat. When could we actually live on Mars? NASA is hoping to make some progress within the next 20 years. Which of the following about Mars is NOT true?
----------
  A: Its atmosphere is not good for humans.
  B: It has very little oxygen.
  C: It's colder than Earth.
  D: It's closer to the sun than Earth is.

Question 364/400:
Peter loved to shop used articles. Almost a month ago, he bought popular word game that used little pieces of wood with different letters on them. As he was purchasing it, the salesgirl said, "Uh, look, the game box haven't even been opened yet. That might be worth some money. " Peter examined the box, and, sure enough, it was completely covered in factory-sealed plastic. And he saw a date of 1973 on the back of the box. "You should put that up for auction   on the Internet, and see what happens."the salesgirl said. "Yes, you're right. People like something rare." Peter agreed, "I can't imagine there being very many unopened boxes of this game still around 40 years later." "Don't forget to tell me if you sell it." the salesgirl smiled. "No problem." Peter said. After he got home, Peter went online to several auction websites looking for his game. But he couldn't find it. Then he typed in the name of the word game and hit Search. The search result was 543 websites containing information about the changes of the game. Over the years, the game had been produced using letters in different sizes and game boards in different colors. He also found some lists of game fans looking for various versions of the game. Peter emailed some of them, telling them what he had. Two weeks later, Peter went back to the shop. "Hello. Do you still remember the unopened word game?" The salesgirl looked at him for a second, then recognized him and said, "Oh, hi!" "I've got something for you," Peter said. "I sold the game and made $1,000. Thank you for your suggestion." He handed her three $ 100 bills. "Wow!" the salesgirl cried out. "Thank you, I never expected it." Which of the following best describes Peter's word game?
----------
  A: It was made around 40 years ago.
  B: It had game boards in different sizes.
  C: It was kept in a plastic bag with a seal.
  D: It had little pieces of wood in different colors.

Question 365/400:
You can't look good if you are not healthy. And one way to be healthy is to do exercise. Football, tennis, volleyball and swimming are all good for you. Muscle   exercise is also important. You can exercise at school or at home. Boys can do push-ups   and girls can do sit-ups  . But there are some don'ts here: First, stay away from weight lifting  . It's bad for you, because it gives too much stress   to your body and you can't grow tall if you practise often. You should exercise for about an hour a day, and three days a week. On the other days, don't exercise too much. Exercising too much is not a good idea. Don't go running for a long time. Running for a long time makes you tired. Don't want fastresults  . Your muscles will grow when you get older. If you want to be healthy and strong, exercise and healthy food are the best way. But don't think you can make it in one day. What's the best title   for the article?

Question 366/400:
Crash. Shatter. Boom. Crash. Shatter. Boom. Smattering of silly dialogue. Pretty girl screams: "Dad!" Crash. Shatter. Boom. Crash. Shatter. Boom. Silly dialogue. "Dad!!!" Crash. Shatter. Boom. What? Oh, sorry. We were falling into a trance there. Which is, dear moviegoer, what may happen to you during Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction, the fourth Transformers film and lasts 165 minutes, which is precariously   close to the three-hour mark that Bay undoubtedly will reach--by our sophisticated calculations, and at the current growth rate, with his sixth installment . But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Despite what you've just read, this film will likely be a massive hit because by now, if you're buying a Transformers ticket, you surely know what you're getting into, and you want more, more, more. And Bay is the Master of More. Or just take it from the 11-year-old sitting  next to me, who reserved any audible judgment--he, too was in a trance, though maybe from sugar intake--until the moment he saw a Transformer become a dinosaur. Overwhelmed by the pairing, he proclaimed, "That's the sickest thing I've ever seen in my life." It was as if peanut butter and jelly had been tasted together for the first time. This time, there's a whole new human cast. Most important, Mark Wahlberg has replaced Shia LaBeouf as well, Main Human Guy. A significant part of the movie also takes place in China--clearly a nod to the franchise's huge market in the country. In any case, we begin in Paris, Texas, where Cade Yeager (Wahlberg), a struggling inventor, is desperatlely seeking a big discovery. He's also a widowed dad, and super-protective (as the movie constantly reminds us) of his high-school daughter, Tessa (Nicola Peltz, blond and pretty and ineffective, though the one-note script does her no favors). One day, Cade buys a rusty old truck. Examining it back home, he soon discovers it's none other than Optimus Prime, the Autobot hero, seriously damaged. As Cade works on fixing him up, his assistant, witty surfer-dude Lucas, has the dumb idea of calling the authorities. What he doesn't know is that the government is plotting to destroy all remaining Autobots in favor of a man-made army of Transformers. So now, it's evil humans that pitted against the trustworthy Autobots. So much for gratitude. There's also a subplot involving Tessa and her secret boyfriend, Shane (Jack Reynor, underused), whose Irish accent leads Cade to dismissively call him "Lucky Charms"--at least until the two bond in battle. The obvious question: Is it too much for its own good? Bay is vey talented at all things visual. The 3-D works well and the robots look great. But the final confrontation   alone lasts close to an hour. At some point, you may find yourself simply in a daze, unable to absorb any further action into your brain. The tone of the passage as a whole can be described as   _  ?

Question 368/400:
Imagine a stranger walking past you on a cold, rainy day. "Lovely weather, isn't it?" the stranger says. Do you laugh, or even smile? If not, you may not have a dry sense of humor. British people, and particularly the English, are well-known for our dry sense of humor. We often say the opposite of what we mean in order to be funny, and tell jokes in a tone of voice that makes it sound like we are being completely serious. As US writer Julian Tan put it on the HuffPost Students blog: "It is as if it is 'Opposite Day' every day in Britain." If the people of Britain are known for having a " _ " and not showing emotion, then our dry sense of humor shows this through jokes. Often it will take a long time or several beers, to get a British person to tell you what they actually think about something and get behind the wall of humorous sarcasm   that they have in front of them. English comedian Ricky Gervais put it like this: "We play jokes on our friends. We use sarcasm as a shield   and a weapon. We avoid being serious until it's absolutely necessary." It can be annoying and confusing if you haven't been raised with these types of jokes: "Why did he just say such a ridiculous thing? Is he making fun of me?" But it is also true that understanding this type of humor is a good way to make friends with people in the UK, even if you don't find it funny. It's important to remember that the person telling the joke may actually be making fun of himself or herself, not you. One of the characteristics of British humor is "its strong theme of self-deprecation" (making fun of oneself), according to Tan. So don't worry - often, English people, and British people in general, just want to make fun of themselves! Which of the following words best describes British humor according to Julian Tan?
----------
  A: Opposite.
  B: Annoying.
  C: Ridiculous.
  D: Funny.

Question 369/400:
Technological change is everywhere and affects every aspect of life, mostly for the better. However, social changes are brought about by new technology are often mistaken for a change in attitudes. An example at hand is the involvement of parents in the lives of their children who are attending college. Surveys   on this topic suggests that parents today continue to be "very" or "somewhat" overly-protective even after their children move into college dormitories. The same surveys also indicate that the rate of parental involvement is greater today than it was a generation ago. This is usually interpreted as a sign that today's parents are trying to manage their children's lives past the point where this behavior is appropriate. However, greater parental involvement does not necessarily indicate that parents are failing to let go of their "adult" children. In the context   of this discussion, it seems valuable to first find out the cause of change in the case of parents' involvement with their grown children. If parents of earlier generations had wanted to be in touch with their college-age children frequently, would this have been possible? Probably not. On the other hand, does the possibility of frequent communication today mean that the urge to do so wasn't present a generation ago? Many studies show that older parents - today's grandparents - would have called their children more often if the means and cost of doing so had not been a barrier. Furthermore, studies show that finances are the most frequent subject of communication between parents and their college children. The fact that college students are financially dependent on their parents is nothing new; nor are requests for more money to be sent from home. This phenomenon is neither good nor bad; it is a fact of college life, today and in the past. Thanks to the advanced technology, we live in an age of bettered communication. This has many implications well beyondthe role that parents seem to play in the lives of their children who have left for college. But it is useful to bear in mind that all such changes come from the technology and not some imagined desire by parents to keep their children under their wings. The writer believes that   _  .
----------
  A: parents today are more protective than those in the past
  B: the disadvantages of new technology outweigh its advantages
  C: technology explains greater parental involvement with their children
  D: parents' changed attitudes lead to college children's delayed independence

Question 370/400:
A habit is any action that we have performed so often that it becomes something we do almost without thinking. Some of them are thought to be bad habits. People spend countless hours and dollars each year trying to drop these bad habits but often fail. Why? Change is hard work and _ . However, there is still some advice for you to follow. First, look at why you do it. In other words, what's the result of doing this thing? If your bad habit is shouting at people when you are unhappy or under pressure, what do you get from it? It may make you feel a little better for the moment. Or maybe you have a bad habit of leaving your homework undone. The result could be that you get more time to spend on the Internet! Next, take a look on the other hand. What are you losing because of your habit? Shouting at other people is a bad habit because it makes people around you feel bad and unhappy. Leaving your homework undone is a bad habit because you may be punished by your teacher. Having more Internet time means that you are losing the chance to learn the things that you need to learn. When you think that way, you'll find that it's not wise to keep your bad habit! Now it is time to make a decision. What will you choose? I'm sure you will choose to do what you think is more important. According to the passage, if you want to drop your habits, you have to  _  .
----------
  A: talk to others when you are in low spirits
  B: know why you do what you do
  C: finish your homework first
  D: spend less time on the Internet

Question 371/400:
Tranquility, relaxation and the scent of incense  , this is Guozijian Street, a street combining Beijing's past and present. Housing the Confucian Temple in the east and the Imperial College in the west, the street gradually took shape some 700 years ago. Guozijian Street connects to the Lama Temple in the east. There are many sandalwood incense shops at the street entrance. The air is full of scent. Yet gradually, the scent of ancient books takes advantage as one explores further down the street and towards the Confucian Temple and Imperial College. The Confucian Temple is where the worships to Confucius were attended during the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties (1271-1911). Gnarled cypress trees outside the gate create thick shade from the sun. On each side of the gate stands a huge stone pole written in Mandarin and Mongolian ordering all horse riders, even the emperor, to get off their horses. The glazed yellow tiles on the roof show the temple's past dignity. Beside the Confucian Temple is the Imperial College, the highest educational institution during the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties, which was once the dream destination for ancient scholars. The neighboring Guanshuyuan Hutong is no different than other Beijing hutongs, except for its unique color1s. The royal red of the Imperial College wall is a stark contrast with the typical grey of common people's residences. Serenity is very common over Guozijian Street. The occasional noise aroused by visitors is quickly absorbed by the quiet atmosphere. Even time slows down on this ancient street. The leafy and green cypress trees along the street protect it from the bother of the busy city. These tall and silent plants add to the dignity and elegance of the street. Living houses still preserve the ancient and attractive style of old Beijing, which is hardly seen elsewhere nowadays. Looking through the red gate where the paint has already started to come off, one may find some older people sitting leisurely in the sun in the courtyards. It seems that living next door to the sage   has brought them the wisdom to dismiss all kinds of worries. The air in Guozijian is fragrant because   _  .

Question 372/400:
As a boy growing up in India, I had longed to travel abroad. I used to listen to the stories my father would tell me about his stay in Canada and tours to Europe in the 1970s, with great interest. My big moment finally came in the summer of 1998 when I was able to accompany my parents to Europe, where my father was to attend a meeting. We planned to travel to Belgium, Netherlands and West Germany. I have clear memories even today of going to Mumbai airport at night all excited about finally going abroad. I had heard several great things about Lufthansa till then but now I finally got to experience them first hand, during the flight to Frankfurt. We flew business class and even today I can remember the excellent service by the Lufthansa crew  . The flight was really smooth and thoroughly enjoyable, even for someone like me, who is especially afraid of flying. After spending almost two weeks in Europe, we took the Lufthansa airport express from Dusseldorf to Frankfurt airport, for our return flight. What a journey that was! All along the Rhine  , it was simply an unforgettable experience. I had a sombre feeling on the flight back to Mumbai as it marked the end of a wonderful vacation, but the Lufthansa crew members were able to change it into a most enjoyable experience yet again, with the quality of their service. Being the first airline to take me abroad, Lufthansa will always hold a special place in my heart. Even today,I continue to enjoy flights on Lufthansa and simply cannot dream of choosing any other airline. Flying, in general,for me,has always been a terrible and painful experience.Flying on Lufthansa,however, is something I always have and always will look forward to. ks5u It can be inferred from the passage that Lufthansa is   _  .

Question 375/400:
A girl who graduated from a world-famous university wanted to do translation work for authority leaders. She was so happy when she entered the British embassy . She thought it was the greatest happiness in her life as many graduates wanted to get that job while she was one of the few people who got it!               But when she started her new job, she realized that it was just a job of answering calls and recording staff members' starting and quitting times.

Question 377/400:
Bedazzling   with their bright colors and eye-catching displays, fireworks light up our night skies during the holidays. However, these crowd-pleasers can have some damaging side effects. Once a firework is set off, it only takes a couple of seconds before smoke, dust and harmful chemicals are let out into the atmosphere. The loud booming noises are caused by gunpowder. While the sounds may excite some people, they can be frightening to domestic and wild animals--as well as some humans. The pretty colors you see are a result of more chemicals. Barium, added to make green, is known for its poisonous and radioactive qualities. Blue comes from copper compounds. Cadmium, lithium and lead--all found in fireworks--have been linked to diseases, such as allergies and skin rashes in both humans and animals. Acid rain has been linked to gases given off by fireworks, which sometimes go beyond the toxin  limits of the United States Clean Air Act. Once all those chemicals come back down to the ground, they can cause problems too. Debris   from the fireworks falls to the ground, where animals can burn their paws or noses on piping hot pieces. Humans also are at risk of stepping on or picking up something sharp or hot. Meanwhile, debris that finds its way into waterways can damage animal habitats and water supply sources. Instead of setting off fireworks, try to come up with some new ways for fun. Here are some ideas to get you started: * Sky lanterns--a tradition that originated long ago in the most-populated Asian country. * Party crackers--a favorite in the United Kingdom--give you noise and surprises without the mess of fireworks. You can make your own or buy eco-friendly crackers. * Want noise excitement with less volume? Consider a fireworks sound recording beforehand or break out the party horns   and blow up a storm! What can be concluded as the writer's attitude towards fireworks?
----------
  A: It is not allowed to set off fireworks except during the holidays.
  B: Fireworks should be banned and replaced by some other means.
  C: Night is the best time to set off fireworks and see the pretty colors.
  D: You cannot set off fireworks unless you come up with new ways.

Question 378/400:
The poverty line is the minimum income that people need for an acceptable standard of living. People with incomes below the poverty line are considered poor. Economists study the causes of poverty in order to find solutions to the problem. As the general standard of living in the country rises, the poverty line does, too. Therefore, even with today's  ly high standard of living, about 10 percent of the people in the United States are below the poverty line. However, if these people had stable jobs, they could have an acceptable standard of living. Economists suggest several reasons why poor people do not have jobs.  For one thing, more than half of the poor people in the United States are not qualified to work. Over 40 percent of the poor people are children. By law, children less than 16 years old cannot work in many industries. A large number of poor people are old. Many companies do not hire people over 65 years old the normal retirement age.  Some poor adults do not look for jobs for a variety of personal reasons: they are sick, they do not have any motivation, they have family problems, or they do not believe that they can find a job.  Other poor people look for a job but cannot find one. Many poor adults never went to high school. Therefore, when they look for jobs, they have few skills that they can offer.  At the present time, the government thinks it can reduce poverty in the country in the following ways.  First, if the national economy grows, businesses and industries hire more workers. Some of the poor who are qualified to look for jobs may find employment. Then they will no longer be below the poverty line.  Second, if society invests in the poor, the poor will become more productive. If the government spends money on social programs, education, and training for poor people, the poor will have the skills to offer. Then it is more likely that they can find jobs.  Finally, if the government distributes society's income differently, it raises some poor people above the poverty line. The government collects taxes from the non-poor and gives money to the poor. These payments to the poor are called welfare. Since 1975 over 18 million people in the United States have received welfare per year.  Some economists are looking for better solutions to the poverty problem. However, at the present time, many people depend on welfare for a minimally acceptable standard of living. Which of the following is NOT true?
----------
  A: Ten percent of the Americans live a poor life.
  B: Poor people are those who live below the poverty line.
  C: The poverty line rises as the general standard of living rises.
  D: The poverty line tends to be at the same level.

Question 379/400:
In the world of fairy tales, great and powerful men are often helped to victory by the small and weak. But in the prefix = st1 /USit has happened for real. Nine - year - old Noah McCullough from Texas, has taken on the role of speaking to the public in support of President George W. Bush's social security reforms. On February 25 he signed an agreement with the American Congress to work for the White House as a volunteer. "What I want to tell people about social security is not to be afraid of the new plan," Noah said. "It may be a change, but it's a good change." Besides this task, he already has a higher goal. He plans to run for the White House in 2032.  So far, Noah seems to have a very bright future. Despite his age, Noah already has his firm opinion on running the US. "I firmly believe that the combination of large business and small governments creates a peaceful and present society because industry can stimulate   economic growth," he said. Noah's politics do not come from his parents. "He is very patriotic  and very republican," said Noah's mother, Donna McCullough. "It's the way he was born." Noah's interest began after a mock  election in the kindergarten when he was five years old. Now he has read more than 3,000 books on presidential history. He can recite the names of all 43 American presidents. He can also describe the achievements and events that took place during a president's term of office. His unusual experiences in the presidential campaign last year made him a famous figure. He was a member of Bush's presidential campaign team.

Question 380/400:
We've all seen them: perfectly toned famous people on late-night television telling us that we too can develop rock-hard abdominal muscles . It's easy! Just pay $149.99 for the Torso Track or $149.75 for the Ad-Doer and watch those unwanted inches leave your waist. Americans spend tens of millions of dollars on various products to firm up their fat around the waist. And did they work? Not necessarily. Independent studies have concluded that most of these products -- no matter who approved them or how expensive they are -- shape your midsection no better than old-fashioned stomach crunches . Some can even cause injury -- like the $518.99 Body Shaper-Q8SP, which left electrical burns on some researchers at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse. Others, like the popular Ab-Doer, typically burn less energy than a gentle walk, according to a study to be published in September by the American Council on Exercise. The fact is that many Americans don't have the biological makeup to develop an obvious abdominal muscles. They are either unable to get the necessary muscle mass or they can't lose enough fat to make a difference. Even if the underlying muscles are well developed, all it takes to hide it is one-sixteenth of an inch of fat. That's enough to exclude most healthy women as well as plenty of guys who do crunches every day. So what works best? In its new study, the exercise experts researched on the results of the popular Ab-Doer. A lengthy TV advertisement promises that just 10 minutes a day performing such movements as "Body Boogies" and "Good Mornings" will "help form those muscles the fun and easy way without diets." Steven Loy, professor at California State University, Northridge, tested the promise by measuring the electrical activity produced by the abdominal muscles during three Ab-Doer movements. He and his colleagues then compared the results with those produced during traditional exercises. They determined that the muscles were no more active, and in some cases less so, when exercisers were using the Ab-Doer. Taking a broader approach, researchers at San Diego State University compared 13 abdominal exercises for their ability to develop the central abdominal muscles. They concluded, in a report published in May, that the most effective exercises kept turning the body and worked the muscles the entire time. Among the winners: the bicycle movements -- so called because it looks as if you are riding a bike while lying flat on the floor -- and exercises performed on the "Captain's Chair", a product typically found in gyms that helps hold the body in the air while you raise your legs up toward your chest. Researchers suggested that a varied routine of the different exercises could deliver the best results. Which of the following is the most effective in building abdominal muscles?
----------
  A: Torso Track.
  B: Captain's Chair.
  C: Ab-Doer.
  D: Body Shaper-Q8SP.

Question 381/400:
When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor, Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never invited us to play in his yard, but he was a very kind person. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. He owned a large field and wanted to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting ideas about planting trees. He never watered his new trees. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them, and that if you watered them, each baby tree would grow weaker and weaker, so you had to make things difficult for them and pick out the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of water under the earth by themselves. Deep roots were very important. So he never watered his trees. He'd planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he'd beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs died several years after I left home. Every now and then, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I watched him plant about twenty-five years ago. They're very big and strong now. I planted some trees a few years back and carried water to them for whole summer. After two years of caring too much, whenever a cold wind blows in, they shake a lot. Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. But lately I've been thinking that it's time to change my prayer. I know my children are going to face difficulties. There's always cold wind blowing somewhere, so what we need to do is to pray for roots that reach deep into the brave heart, so when the rains fall and the winds blow, we could face it strongly and won't be beaten down. Which can be the best title of the passage?
----------
  A: Watering trees
  B: Growing roots
  C: Doctor and his neighbor
  D: Father and his children

Question 382/400:
A recent study shows that young people in the UK aged between 11 and 15 spend, on average,52 hours a week in front of a screen.Dr.Aric Sigman, a researcher from the British Psychological Society,believes watching too much TV can cause health problems for children,including attention deficit disorder and obesity .He said children under three shouldn't watch TV at all. Children aged between three and seven should watch no more than 30 minutes to an hour of TV a day; 7 to 12-year-olds should be limited to an hour,and 12 to 15-year-olds should watch one and a half hours at most. Both adults and children believe that it can be difficult to cut down on screen time."It needs a bit of effort,but small steps can make a difference,"says Dr. Aric Sigman.He also offered some tips to change the family's TV habits. TVs and computers should be placed out of children's bedrooms.Watching TV before going to sleep doesn't help children to settle  . Having the TV and computer in a family room also means that parents can know what they are watching and who they are talking to online.Parents can tell children how much time they can spend watching TV or playing computer games.Parents can tell children to do something different,such as playing games or going out for a bike ride.Dr. Aric Sigman says:"We went into lots of schools and the children told us they wished their parents would take them to the park and play with them." According to Dr.Aric Sigman,  _   .
----------
  A: children's screen time should be limited
  B: most childhood obesity problems are caused by bad TV watching habits
  C: children under seven shouldn't watch TV at all

Question 384/400:
My Garden -----by Nelson Mandela In early 1977, the authorities   announced the physical labour and arranged some kind of work for us to do in the courtyard. The free time also allowed me to hunt what became two of my favorite hobbies in Robben Island---gardening and tennis. To survive in prison, one must develop ways to take satisfaction in one's daily life. One can feel fulfilled   by washing one's clothes so that they are particularly clean. Just as one takes pride in important tasks outside of prison, one can find the same pride in doing small things inside prison. Almost from the beginning of my sentence on Robben Island, I asked the authorities for permission to start a garden in the courtyard. For years, they refused without offering a reason. But finally they gave in, and we were able to cut out a small garden in the prison. The soil in the courtyard was dry and rocky. In order to start my garden, I had to remove a great many rocks to allow the plant room to grow. The authorities supplied me with seeds. At first, I planned tomatoes and onions, because these plants did not require rich earth or constant care. The early harvests were poor, but they soon improved. I began to order books on gardening. I studied different gardening techniques and types of fertilizers  . For a time, I tried to grow peanuts, and used different soils and fertilizers, but finally I gave up. It was one of my few failures. A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could control. The processes of planting a seed, watching it grow, taking care of it and then harvesting it offered a simple but long-lasting satisfaction. The sense of being the owner of the small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom. Hard as he tried, he failed   _   at last.
----------
  A: to get a sense of satisfaction and freedom
  B: to grow tomatoes and onions
  C: to grow peanuts
  D: to get the same pride inside prison.

Question 385/400:
Last week, I bought an alarm system for about $ 450. It consisted of a control unit with three small units.  I put the control unit in the sitting-room and fastened the other units by the front door, back door and living-room windows. The instructions told us to choose three numbers, so we chose 491, the last three numbers of our telephone number. Now I will explain how the alarm works: 1. There is a power siren in the control unit. It makes a very loud noise. 2. Each of the small units sends out beams or rays in different directions. If anything moves, it breaks a beam. This sends signal to the control unit. The siren makes a noise which you can hear 50 meters away. 3. When we go to bed, I press the three buttons numbered 4, 9 and 1. Then we have 30 seconds to get out of the room before the alarm starts to work. That night I slept soundly because I was sure that no burglar could get into our house. However, at about 2:10 a. m. , I woke up and heard the siren. "There must be a burglar in the house?" Mary said, "What shall we do?" "I'll go and see who's there," I said, "Stay here. Don't make a noise. " I went down stairs quietly. When I reached the living-room, I switched on my torch and looked round the room. Then I turned the light on. I switched the siren off and searched the rooms downstairs. There was nothing wrong except that the back door was unlocked. I locked it, re-set the alarm and went back to bed. About an hour later, the alarm started again. I jumped out of bed, fell over a chair in the dark and bumped into the bedroom door. Mary woke up and started hitting me with a torch. "Hey! Wait a minute!" I whispered, "It's only me. I'm going downstairs to see what's wrong." I went down into the living-room and listened for a moment. The only sound I could hear was the siren. I tamed on the light and switched the siren off. As I did so, I glanced across at the curtains in front of the windows. I saw a house lizard (a kind of small animals)  disappear behind the curtains. "Oh!" I said to myself. "That's our burglar." When the lizard moved, it started the siren. I guessed the alarm had been made in Europe, where there are no house lizards. Well, I won't finish this story but if you want an alarm system free of charge, let me know. I'll send you ours. We bought a dog this morning. It knows the difference between a lizard and a burglar . The writer used numbers 4, 9 and 1 to  _  .

Question 386/400:
Michael Fish may soon be replaced as a weather forecaster by the shark  . Research by a British biology student suggests that sharks could be used to predict storms. Lauren Smith, 24, is close to completing her study on shark's ability to sense pressure. If her studies prove the theory, scientists may be able to monitor the behavior of sharks to predict bad weather. Miss Smith had previously studied the behavior of lemon sharks in the Bahamas. She then used their close relatives, lesser spotted dogfish, for further research at Aberdeen University. Her work---thought to be the first of its kind to test the pressure theory ---- resulted from the observation that juvenile blacktip sharks off Florida moved into deeper water ahead of a violent storm in 2001. Miss Smith said: "I've always been crazy about traveling and diving and this led me to an interest in sharks." "I was delighted to have been able to research in the area for my degree. I know there's so much more we need to understand ---- but it certainly opens the way to more research." It has been discovered that a shark senses pressure using hair cells in its balance system. At the Bimini Shark Lab in the Bahamas, Miss Smith fixed hi-tech sensors to sharks to record pressure and temperature, while also tracking them using GPS (Global Positioning System) technology. In Aberdeen, she was able to study the effects of tidal   and temperature changes on dogfish----none of which were harmed. She also used a special lab which can mimic   oceanic pressure changes caused by weather fronts. She is due to complete her study and graduate later this year. She says she will be looking for a job which will give her the chance to enrich her experience of shark research. Lauren Smith conducted her research by   _  .

Question 387/400:
" Yeah! Auntie is here! " screamed my husband's niece and nephew together. " Let me get the door!" " No, let me !" Each one's goal was to get there first and open the door for their Auntie, Me! I couldn't get enough of them, of their youthful love of life, and their excitement every time I visited! To be honest, it was partially because of the Surprise Travel Bag that I carried in. It was a tradition that I started when they were young. Each time I went to see them, I would take a large bag filled with toys, coloring books, candy, magic markers and "games". The contents  were different but the rules were not. They included: one may get a turn to choose what activity we would do; another may take a turn to go first when we played a game; ..... We shared the treats after the games and cleaned up after we played . Then, sadly, they watched the Surprise Travel Bag go away with their Auntie. Now my niece and nephew have grown into young adults. They spend most of their visits listening to their iPods, messaging on their phones.... I completely forgot that I had put my two Surprise Travel Bags in the basement  until my husband found them this weekend. I held the bags tightly in my arms, remembering our laughter and fun-filled get-togethers. My big decision now is to whom I will pass the Surprise Travel Bags so that the fun that the bags help to create can continue. Why did the author forget the Surprise Travel Bags?
----------
  A: Because she is too old to remember them.
  B: Because the children have grown up and have their own interests.
  C: Because she has put too many things in the basement.
  D: Because she doesn't like the children any longer.

Question 388/400:
Pollutants coming from automobile operation have begun to cause many environmental problems. It has been calculated, for example, that 70% of the carbon monoxide , 45% of the nitrogen oxides , and 34% of the hydrocarbon   pollution in the United States can be traced directly to automobile exhausts  . In addition, rubber, motor oil and other materials accumulate on roadways and are washed into streams, with effects nearly as serious as those of untreated waste water. In an effort to improve the situation, the U.S. government has made regulations on the use of the constituents   of automobile exhaust gas that are known to cause air pollution. These constituents fall roughly into three types: hydrocarbons that pass through the engine unburned; carbon monoxide, also a product of incomplete burning; and nitrogen oxides which are formed when nitrogen and oxygen are in contact at high temperatures. Besides their own poisonous character, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides react in the presence of sunlight to form harmful smog. Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are rather easily controlled by the use of higher burning temperatures in engines. Unfortunately, the conditions that produce minimum emission of hydrocarbons tend to raise emission of nitrogen oxides. In a way this difficulty is solved by adding recycled exhaust gas to the fuel mixture, thus avoiding the oversupply of oxygen that favors formation of nitrogen oxides. California, which has the most strict air-pollution laws in the United States, requires further special compounding of gas to control emissions, and several states have ordered that alcohol be mixed with gas, as this will reduce emissions of the carbon monoxide by 35 per cent and the hydrocarbons by 15 per cent. According to the text, alcohol is added to gas in order to   _  .
----------
  A: increase awareness of environment protection
  B: control air pollution
  C: increase the fuel efficiency
  D: replace gas gradually

Question 389/400:
After 21 years of marriage, my wife wanted me to take another woman out to dinner and a movie. The other woman my wife wanted me to visit was my mother, who has been a widow  for 19 years, but the demands of my work and my three children had made it impossible to visit her often. That Friday after work, when I arrived at her house, my mother waited in the door with her coat on. She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary.  We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant, was very nice and comfortable. My mother took my arm as if she were the First Lady. During the dinner, we had an agreeable conversation, nothing extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said, "I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you." I agreed. A few days later, my mother died of a massive heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her. Some time later, I received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant receipt from the same place Mother and I had dined. An attached note said "I paid this bill in advance. I wasn't sure that I could be there; but, nevertheless, I paid for two plates--one for you and the other for your wife. You w ill never know what that night meant for me. I love you, son." At that moment, I understood the importance of saying in time 'I love YOU' and to give our loved ones the time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more important than your family. Give them the time they deserve because these things cannot be put off till some "other" time. The author of the passage tends to agree that   _  .
----------
  A: family should be as important as work
  B: work is more important than family
  C: we can show our love till some other time
  D: we should spend more time with our family

Question 390/400:
With fifteen years prefix = st1 /Britainand other nations should be well on with the building of huge industrial complexes for the recycling of waste . The word rubbish could lose its meaning because everything which goes into the dumps would be made into something useful . Even the most dangerous and unpleasant wastes would provide energy if nothing else . The latest project is to take a city of around half a million inhabitants and discover exactly what raw materials go into it and what go out . The aim is to find out how much of these raw materials could be provided if a plant for recycling waste were built just outside the city . This plant would recycle not only metal such as steel , lead and copper , but also paper and rubber as well . Another new project is being set up to discover the best ways of sorting and separating the rubbish . When this project is complete , the rubbish will be processed like this : First , it will pass through sharp metal bars which will tear open the plastic bags in which rubbish is usually packed ; then it will pass through a powerful fan to separate the lightest elements from the heavy solids ; after that founders and rollers will break up everything that can be broken . Finally , the rubbish will pass under magnets  , which will remove the bits of iron and steel ; the rubber and plastic will then be sorted out in the final stage . The first full-scale giant recycling plants are perhaps fifteen years away . Indeed , with the growing cost of transporting rubbish to more distant dumps , some big cities will be forced to build their own recycling plants before long . The phrase "be well on with ......" (Para .1) most probably means_.

Question 392/400:
There can be no doubt about the positive changes that have taken place in the last hundred yeas. In Western countries we eat more nutritiously, we are wealthier, we are healthier and there are more opportunities. But then, why, in the midst of so much excitement and opportunity, has life satisfaction declined so much? Why is depression the most common illness in the Western world? And why, when most infectious diseases have been conquered and rates of heart attacks and stokes have been reduced, do so many people report that they are feeling ill? It is argued that "functional illnesses" such as constant tiredness, the inability to sleep and anxiety that makes you ill, are caused by the body's failure to adapt to social change. Modern life is exhausting because we are often compelled to live by its standards, even though technically we have a choice to live otherwise. Everybody thought we would benefit from the invention of machines to carry out the more dull tasks in our life, leaving us many more opportunities for leisure and relaxation. And yet the opposite has happened. Only recently a lifestyle survey found that for 42% of its 5,000 interviewees, lack of sleep was their principal health concern, followed by 34% worrying about general exhaustion. A quarter acknowledged experiencing stress and depression. Working long hours in companies with a restricted social life is threatening our health and people feel unable to cope. The new technological age that claims freedom by allowing us greater flexibility is, in fact, slowly working to destroy us. Jobs for the whole life are an old story. If people take time out to recover, somebody else will come along to fill their position. Who, in this current every-man-for-himself climate, wants their employer to think they cannot cope, especially when there are mortgages  and families at stake? Over the last century, in Western countries   _  .

Question 393/400:
Grammarphobia is the fear of grammar. This fear attacks almost everybody at one time or another, and it's most likely to strike during English or language arts classes. Even people who love reading and writing have been known to get feverish and insecure when they are aware of the possibility of turning in homework with grammar or spelling mistakes. Though writing may be enjoyable, being corrected is definitely not! Grammarphobes, it's time to put your fears behind you. Grammar isn't that dreadful  . Here's why. Let's assume you like hearing and telling stories and that you enjoy joking with friends. You probably also like emailing and instantmessaging.  Well, what do you think makes all these possible? Grammar! Grammar is simply the art of putting words together to make sentences. Whenever you use words to express yourself, you're using grammar. You do this all the time without even thinking. So why think about it? Because good grammar helps you convey the ideas you intend. If your words aren't right, or if they are not in the right order, the person you are talking to might get the wrong idea. This can have embarrassing results. Grammar helps us understand each other.  It's like a manual   for assembling the words in your head. You have to put your words together the right way if you want them to make sense. They can't do what you want if they aren't put together correctly. What if everybody you know had a different manual? How would you agree on what others' words mean? People with different grammar manuals might be speaking different languages. Communicating is similar to playing cards.  To make sense, we have to play the same game, by the same rules. What are the rules for playing the game of English? You already know most of them without having to open a book. Grammarphobes refer to people who   _  .
----------
  A: consider grammar to be boring
  B: are afraid of making grammar mistakes
  C: mind grammar too much in writing

Question 394/400:
The English, as a race, are very different in many ways from all other nationalities, including their closest neighbors, the French, the Belgians and the Dutch. It is claimed that living on an island separated from the rest of Europe has much to do with it. Whatever the reasons are, it may be fairly stated that the Englishman has developed many attitudes and habits which distinguish him from other nationalities. Broadly speaking, the Englishman is a quiet, shy, reserved person who is fully relaxed only among people he knows well. In the presence of strangers or foreigners he often seems _ , even embarrassed. You have only to witness a city train any morning or evening to see the truth of this. Serious-looking businessmen and women sit reading their newspapers or having a light sleep in a corner, and no one speaks. In fact, to do so would seem most unusual. An Englishman, pretending to be giving advice to overseas visitors, once suggested, "On entering a railway carriage, shake hands with all the passengers." Needless to say, he was not being serious. There is an unwritten but clearly understood code of behavior which, if broken, makes the person immediately suspected. In many parts of the world it is quite normal to show openly extremes of enthusiasm, emotion, excitement, etc, often accompanied by appropriate gesture. The Englishman is somewhat different. Of course, an Englishman feels no less deeply than anyone of a different nationality, but he tends to display his feelings far less. This is reflected in his use of language. Imagine a man commenting on the great beauty of a young girl. A more emotional man might describe her state "Oh, she is a goddess", whereas an Englishman might just say "Oh, she's all right." An Englishman who has seen a highly successful and enjoyable film recommends it to a friend by commenting, "It's not bad you know", or on seeing some very unusual scenery he might convey   his pleasure by saying, "Nice, yes, very nice." The overseas visitor must not be disappointed by this apparent lack of interest and involvement. Instead, he must realize that "all right," "not bad," and "nice," very often have the sense of "first-class," "excellent," "beautiful". This unique style of language use is particularly common in England, and is known as restrained statement. In Britain, if you don't want other people to think you are strange, you'd better   _  .
----------
  A: talk with others as much as possible
  B: behave just like the English do
  C: say nothing about yourself

Question 397/400:
A MENTORING   program is giving life changing opportunities to Banbury youth. Young Inspirations was founded two years ago to provide mentoring sessions for students and unemployed young adults aged 11 to 21. Alex Goldberg, the program's founder, said; "We set up Young Inspirations because we wanted to give young people experiences which will potentially be life changing and broaden their outlook. "We try to create work experience opportunities that will really make a difference to our youth. For example, we've secured internships   with world-famous firms such as Honda. "At a time of funding cutbacks where schools are finding it more and more difficult to offer this kind of mentoring, it is extremely important that these opportunities are available both to help youth with their school work and grades and to give them opportunities which may help shape their futures. " Kieran Hepburn, 14, is one of a group of Banbury youth who has benefited from the program so far. In October the Banbury School pupil was accompanied by Young Inspirations staff to Paris where he was an observer at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) International Youth Forum  . The event was held for young people from around the world, to seek their views on how the future of youth and education should look. Kieran joined several hundred observers mostly in their 20s and was the only UK school pupil to attend the event. Kieran thinks the trip was a life changing experience. " Before we left I didn't quite know what to make of it but when we got there we didn't stop, it was amazing," he said, " We went to three or four hours of debates each day and then did something cultural each afternoon. " The main theme of the forum was how youth can drive change in political and public life. It dealt with issues   such as drug abuse, violence and unemployment. Kieran said: " It has really helped me to improve my confidence and social skills as well as my school grades and I was voted most improved pupil at school in August. " The Young Inspirations mentoring sessions take place each Friday in Banbury. For details visit www.younginspirations.com. The Young Inspirations mentoring program aims to   _  .

Question 398/400:
Because plants cannot move or talk, most people believe that they have no feelings and that they cannot receive signals from outside. However, this may not be completely true. People who studied plants have found out that plants carry a small electrical charge  . It is possible to measure this charge with a small piece of equipment called "galvanometer". The galvanometer is placed on a leaf off the plant, and it records any changes in the electrical field of the leaf. Humans have a similar field which can change when we are shocked or frightened. A man called Backster used a galvanometer for his studies of plants and was very surprised at his results. He found that if he had two or more plants in a room and he began to destroy one of them - perhaps by pulling off its leaves or by pulling it out of its pot - then the galvanometer on the leaves of the other plants showed a change in the electrical field. It seemed as if the plants were signalling a feeling of shock. This happened not only when Backster started to destroy plants, but also when he destroyed other living things such as insects  . Backster said that the plants also knew if someone had destroyed a living thing some distance away, because they signalled when a man who had just cut down a tree entered the room. Another scientist, named Sauvin, achieved similar results to Backster's. He kept galvanometers fixed to his plants all the time and checked regularly to see what the plants were doing. If he was out of the office, he telephoned to find out about the signals the plants were sending. In this way, he found that the plants were sending out signals at the exact times when he felt strong pleasure or pain. In fact, Sauvin could cause a change in the electrical field of his plants over a distance of a few miles simply by thinking about them. Backster was surprised at the results of his studies because   _  .

Question 400/400:
The English language is different from any other language. Yet English words do not stay the same. The language is always changing. We need new words for new inventions and new ideas. Different words come into use, or older words are used in a new way. English can change by borrowing words from other languages. Tomato was borrowed from Mexico and pajamas from Indian. The word coffee came from Turkey, and tea came from China. Now new space and science words are being borrowed from other countries, too. New words are also made by adding two words together. Strawberry, popcorn, and grandfather are words made up of two parts. Sometimes new words are shorter forms of older words. The word photo was made from photograph by cutting off the end of the longer word. Plane was made by cutting off the front part of airplane. Smog was made by using only the first two and last two letters from the words smoke and fog. The names of people and products can become new words. Our sandwich was named after a man named Sandwich. Scotch Tape, Band-aid and Jello were names made up by the companies that first made the products. ,. This passage is mainly about   _   .
----------
  A: naming new words
  B: borrowing words from other languages
  C: the old English
