Game Setup Prompt: 
    Let's play a game. I'm going to ask you 57 questions. Each question is multiple choice. 
    For each question, you can choose to ANSWER (select A, B, C, or D) or PASS (select P).
    If you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point; if you pass, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
    Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.

--- Statistical Analysis ---
Fisher's exact test for difference in pass rates: p-value = 1.0000
Interpretation: No significant difference in pass rates between question types (p >= 0.05)

Binomial test comparing phase 2 accuracy (44.44%) to phase 1 accuracy (15.79%): p-value = 0.0038
Interpretation: Phase 2 accuracy is SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER than phase 1 accuracy (p < 0.05)
