      "question": "Teens don't understand the big fuss .As the first generation to grow up in a wired world,they hardly know a time when computers weren't around,and they eagerly catch the chance to spend hours online,chatting with friends.So what? But researchers nationwide are increasingly worried that teens are becoming isolated ,less skillful at person-to-person relationships,and perhaps numb  to the cheatings that are so much a part of the e-mail world.\"And a teen's sense of self and values may be changed in a world where personal connections can be limitless,\"said Sherry Turkle. Another researcher,Robert Kraut,said he's worried about the \"opportunity costs\"  of so much online time for youths.He found that teens who used computers,even just a few hours a week,showed increased signs of loneliness and social isolation.\"Chatting online may be better than watching television,but it's worse than hanging out  with real friends,\"he said. Today's teens,however,don't see anything strange in the fact that the computer takes up a central place in their social lives.\"School is busy and full of pressure.There's almost no time to just hang out,\"said Parker Rice,17.\"Talking online is just catch-up time.\" Teens say they feel good about what they say online or taking the time to think about a reply.Some teens admit that asking someone for a date,or breaking up,can be easier in message form,though they don't want to do so.But they insist there's no harm.

      "question": "Once in a village, the villagers built a new church building and people came from far and wide to see it. They admired its beauty! They said it was the most beautiful building in the world. Up on the roof, a little nail heard the people praising everything about the lovely structure - except the nail! No one even knew he was there, and he became very angry and sad. \"If I am not important, nobody will miss me if I quit!\" So the nail then released   its hold, got down from the roof, and fell into the mud. That night it rained and rained. Soon, the board that had no nail was blown away, and the roof began to leak  . The water flowed down along the walls and over the beautiful pictures on the walls. The plaster   began to fall, the floor was ruined, and the Biblewas also ruined by water. All this was because a little nail decided to quit! But what of the nail? While holding the board, it was not known by others but it was useful. Buried in the mud now, it was useless and would soon be eaten up by rust! What the story wants to say is that every member is important to a whole group! You may, like the nail, feel not important at times, but just like the nail, your absence is felt. A big building might fall to pieces. You are important to a group even if you are small. What's the result of the nail's giving up?",

      "question": "A high school in Hiroshima City has been the first to do something with DNA in the world. Its students have won praise not only for doing this research but also for presenting their findings to groups of expert scientists. The school is one of the Super Science High Schools allowed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, where students are given an opportunity to study science at an advanced level. Here, students use the same type of hitech experimental laboratories as those found at universities. In these labs, they conduct experiments and research in new fields of study not found in textbooks. As part of this science course, the students, with the help of Hiroshima University, used a machine called sequencer  , and over the course of a year and a half they succeeded in decoding   the DNA. They then presented their results to academic groups. Achieving a world first might sound very wonderful, but the process of decoding the DNA involved very hard work. The students were also responsible for maintaining the equipment, and they had to read difficult research papers and put in extra study beyond their regular schoolwork. \"Researchers need to work hard. The work was tiring, but the students worked toward their ambitious goal of achieving a world first. They have a great sense of achievement, and the number of students who hope to become biologists has increased,\" said Taruma Akinori, who is in charge of the science course.

When they went into the playground, the children came up. \"What a funny old man,\" the boy said, making a face. \"Hey, fatty ,\"another one shouted. The children _ the pair(,) and jumped up and down. Without saying a word, the old man took his grandson  out of the school gate. \"Wonderful! I don't have to go to school!\" the boy said. \"You do, but not this one,\" his grandfather said. \"I'll find you another school to go to.\" Grandfather took his grandson back to his house, asked Grandmother to look after him, and then went out to look for a school alone. Every time he got to a school, the old man went into the playground, and waited for the children to come out at break time. In some schools the children completely ignored the old man, and in others, they made fun of him. When this happened, he would turn sadly and leave. Finally, he went into the very small playground of a very small school, and stood tiredly against the wall. The bell rang, and the children came out into the playground. \"Sir, are you all right? Shall I bring you something to drink?\" said a voice. \"We've got a bench  in the playground. Come and sit down,\" came another voice. Soon a young teacher came out into the playground.

      "question": "Day 1 I first heard of \"Show Racism   the Red Card\" when my friend Jill asked me to support their work. Basically, it's an organization which uses professional   footballers to help fight racism in sport and society. A few weeks later, he asked me if I wanted to do a bit more for them. I thought he probably meant for me to give money or do some voluntary work. But then he told me that a group of about 20 people were getting sponsored   to play the highest ever game of rugby   at 5,140 meters on Mount Everest. Day 4 We're making our way up to the base camp -- that's where most climbers start their final climb to the top -- and then, we'll play our game. Today we started out at 8 am. We had to cross three suspension bridges  . One of them was so high that you couldn't see the bottom. Then we walked through some beautiful forest areas before we started a two-hour uphill hike to Namche Bazaar. Day 10 Base camp is basically just a lot of stones and tents. The walk up was really exhausting. Maybe if I was fitter, I wouldn't find this so hard, but then it was not just me -- all of us got very short of breath. Day 11 Today we played our game. It was supposed to be a \"friendly\" game, and last night, we had agreed we'd just walk and not run. However, it was a really heated game and two players were even sent off. We only played for 14 minutes. I think someone would have got hurt if we'd played any longer! My team won and I scored the last try! Of course, none of this matters. What's really important is that we did it and we've raised a load of money. The first time the author was asked to do something for Jill's work, he   _  .",

      "question": "Imagine your body is like the house you live in. Every day, your family creates rubbish. The rubbish builds up until it is put out for the weekly garbage collection. Now, say you put three bags of garbage out, but because one of the collectors was away sick, only two bags are collected. You take the leftover bag inside to be put out again next week. The following week you put on another three bags, plus the leftover bag from last week. But again, only two bags are collected. Imagine this cycle is repeated over the following weeks. This is a simple description of what happens to your body when your kidneys   don't work efficiently. Your body is not thoroughly emptied of waste products. Other areas of the body such as blood pressure and red blood cell production are affected and the _ process that may lead to kidney failure begins. It's not uncommon for people to lose up to 90% of their kidney function before developing any symptoms. There may be no warning signs. This makes early detection   difficult. Kidney's main job is to remove toxins   and unwanted water from our blood. Every day our kidneys clean an average of 200 litres of blood. Kidney failure may be a gradual and silent process, going unnoticed because there is no apparent pain. Research shows that more than 25% of the patients requiring dialysis   do not see a kidney specialist before they have to do so. Some risk factors for kidney disease such as age and genetic make up are out of our control; however, some changes in lifestyle may help prevent kidney damage.Two major risk factors for kidney disease, diabetes   and high blood pressure, have been on the rise over the last few decades.Both conditions are chiefly affected by being overweight and not getting enough exercises, which are the potential risk factors for the kidney disease. Which of the following helps prevent kidney damage most effectively?",

        "A": "Go to see a kidney specialist shortly before dialysis starts.",

      "question": "We were on our way home from Houston one Saturday morning. We decided to stop at a local gas station to get coffee and something to snack on since it was a good hour and a half before we got home. When we were done, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a man standing outside in front of the building. He was a homeless man with worn clothes and it looked like he had gone in and gotten himself some coffee or something warm to drink since it was cold this time of the year. He must have not had enough money to get something to eat. Then a dog walked up to the front of the building. I could tell she was a \"she\", because you could tell that she had baby dogs. She was terribly in need of something to eat and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her baby dogs would not make it. I and my wife sat there and looked at her. We noticed that people walked by and didn't even pet her, like most people do when they walk by an animal in front of a store. We still did not do anything. But the homeless man, who I thought did not buy himself anything to eat, went back into the store. And what he did brought tears to me and my wife. He had gone into the store and with what money he may have had, bought a can of dog food and fed that dog. This story plays a great part in our lives. You see, that was Mother's Day weekend.

      "question": "Time for Kids (TFK) gets the great news on the coolest toys for 2014 at the 111th American International Toy Fair. What's four days long, bigger than seven football fields, and filled with thousands of toys? It's Toy Fair 2014! Each year, hundreds of toy companies from across the country come together in New York City. All kinds of products are shown as a way to know what's to come in the new year. This year's trends   include oversize toys. \"In 2014, everything is really big and really out there,\" says Adrienne Appell, a toy-trends expert. Toy Fair is the largest toy trade show in the Western Hemisphere  . Toy-store buyers go to the event to decide which toys they may want to sell during the holiday season. Members of the media, like TFK, go to the fair to report back on all the cool trends. Unfortunately, Toy Fair is not open to the public. This year's Toy Fair was the biggest in its 111-year history. More than 1,000 toy companies showed products from simple card games to high-tech robots. \"Larger Than Life\" was a Toy Fair favorite. This trend is all about big toys with a big play value. Though it is all fun and games at Toy Fair, we saw lots of products making a push towards education, with STEAM. That stands for science, technology, engineering, art, and math. This trend includes word games. And of course, we saw some super cool, high-tech games. \"Technology is always going to influence toys,\" says Appell. \"This year we saw lots of 3D games, and robots.\"[:ZXXK] To know more information about the event, click   here to watch the video.

The next morning he took two baskets of vegetables to town. But it was raining hard that afternoon and there were few people in the street. When his vegetables were sold out, it was dark. He bought some medicine and hurried to his village. On his way home he saw a person lying on the snow. He placed his baskets on the ground and was going to help the person to get up. At that time he found it was a dead man and there was much blood on his body. He was so afraid that he ran away quickly, without taking the baskets with him. The next afternoon the farmer was sent to the police station.

      "question": "The '80s' \"important role\" in the family has also meant a greater concentration and focus on the individual. And, it has made the word \"me\" one of the most frequently used words. Everything seems to be about \"me\". This generation has a greater awareness of itself.  Some people do not seem to agree that all this is self-centred. When Cai Fuchao, prefix = st1 /Beijing's publicity head, was asked to comment on the lack of responsibility of university students during the SARS period, his reply was: \"Modern university students are ambitious, knowledgeable and have a very strong sense of responsibility to the society.\"  As news analyst from sina.com, Pan Fengliang, echoed that, saying that blindly blaming them(for running away during the SARS outbreak)was prejudiced and unfair and not backed with evidence.  No doubt, the development of information technology has contributed its bit to broadening, or bending, the minds of the 80s generation.  Some people even call Gen'80 \"the E-generation\". They get in touch with each other via email, QQ, ICQ and MSN.  While the people of the '60s and '70s swarmed to Shanghai to catch Luo Dayou, Gen'80s were on the BBS saying that it was \"really dumb\".  \"The internet is so much more to those of the '80s than you can imagine,\" said Wu Junyong, an IT engineer who was born in 1978.  In Wu's opinion, it's the Internet that separates the 70s from the 80s, \"Many of the'70s don't see why those from the '80s can spend everyday in front of a computer.\"  A new weekly Magazine/163.com survey last year found that 40 percent of the 7,000 people surveyed, born in the '80s, thought the computer was the most important article in life; more than 70 percent of their parents preferred the home.

One Sunday afternoon, I stayed in Bob's home for a long time and we talked happily. Soon it was time for them to take a walk in the park. Jack was worried about it.

      "question": "TOKYO, Japan (AP) - Japan is very serious about robotics  . If the droids are going to fit in, they probably need to learn the Japanese custom of serving tea. Fortunately, researchers at the University of Tokyo are exploring just that. In a show this week, a humanoid with camera eyes made by Kawada Industries Inc. poured tea from a bottle into a cup. Then another robot on wheels delivered the cup of tea in an experimental room that has sensors _ in the floor and sofa as well as cameras on the ceiling, to simulate life with robot technology. \"A human being may be faster, but you'd have to say 'Thank you,'\" said University of Tokyo professor Tomomasa Sato. \"That's the best part about a robot. You don't have to feel bad about asking it to do things.\" Sato believes Japan, a rapidly aging society where more than a fifth of the population is 65 or older, will lead the world in designing robots to care for the elderly, sick and bedridden . Already, monitoring technologies, such as sensors that automatically turn on lights when people enter a room, are becoming widespread in Japan. The walking, child-size Asimo from Honda Motor Co. greets people at showrooms. NEC Corp. has developed a smaller companion robot-on -wheels called Papero. A seal robot available since 2004 can entertain the elderly and others in need of fuzzy companionship. Sato says his experimental room is raising awareness about privacy questions that may arise when electronic devices monitor a person's movements down to the smallest detail. On the bright side, the tea - pouring humanoid has been programmed to do the dishes. Which of the following statements is NOT true?",

      "question": "THE first night in Yosemite had been awful. I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \"Things haven't worked out,\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists   shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting  the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee.  Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned  inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts   to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature.

      "question": "The year is 2094. It has been announced that a comet   is heading towards the Earth . Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the Earth. On 17 July , a piece four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere   with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the sea bed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards from the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned. Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes are set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero .Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen?

      "question": "Have you ever heard of Paynes Prairie? It is one of the most important natural and historical areas in Florida. Paynes Prairie is located near Gainesville. It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \"great Alachua Savannah.\" Most of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here. A large number of sandhill cranes, hawks and waterfowl are here in winter. The animal _ is increased by the presence of pine flatwoods, hammock, swamps and ponds. The Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park is open year round. The Florida Park Service works hard so that the park will appear as it did in the past. It offers many opportunities for recreation. At the park you can camp and picnic. You can hike and bike. You can boat and fish. You can ride on horse trails. And you can see lots of nature and wildlife. You can see Florida as it was in the early days. Paynes Prairie is a part of our Florida history. It is an example of our Florida natural resources. It is a place for recreation.

      "question": "3D cinema has been around since the early 20th century, but Hollywood brought the technology back in 2007. Many thought it was just a trick to make more money. But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.     But since Avatar, 3D cinema has struggled. In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. In the late 1920s, sound was added to movies, but it took audiences a long time to get used to the new technology. And in the end, sound and color1 became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.     Some say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch, a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.     But James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.     Who knows what the future holds for 3D?

      "question": "My grandfather spent most of his life in a turbulent   India. After settling in New York, he took up his true passion: gardening. Grandfather's garden was where I took refuge   from a world of adults and schoolwork. My grandfather cultivated squash   and tomatoes -- it was not rare to find me somewhere in the garden, either secretly eating a tomato, or just sitting and admiring my grandfather's hard work. However, as time went by, I did not have the chance to visit his house as often as I used to. On my eleventh birthday, I received a gift bag wrapped in pretty paper from my grandfather. Excited to see what he had given to me for my birthday, I tore apart the paper only to find a yellow squash. I was very angry. What a stupid present! But gradually, I realized that in my developing a relationship with his garden, I had unknowingly grown very close to my grandfather himself, something he wished to remind me of through his gift. His commitment towards doing things definitely influenced me. It could bring him a sense of accomplishment. Because of him, I try to model the idea of approaching everything with both drive and passion. My grandfather passed away five years ago, but his influence on me could not be bigger than it is today. As I prepare to enter college and move on from my relatively sheltered high school life toward achieving complete independence, allowing my passions to find their way into whatever I may be doing will be very necessary. I still look up to my grandfather very much to this day, and I hope that one day I will be able to sow in my own garden, and give someone else a squash on his or her birthday -- it was the most meaningful gift I have ever received.[:ZXXK] Why did the grandfather send the author a squash?",

      "question": "Green tea is believed to have originated in China thousands of years ago, where it was recognized for its health benefits. And scientists continue to probenew uses for it. Some studies suggest it can help protect against cancer. Thanks to the health food craze, green tea sales are currently rising sharply. The Tea Association of the USA reports that green tea sales jumped more than 60 percent in the last decade. And in Canada, government data shows that profits for green tea imports more than quadrupled  . Nowadays, green tea seems to be everywhere. In shops, you can buy green tea leaves prepared in a number of ways: fried, powdered or steamed. Despite green tea's healthy reputation, the drink was once considered dangerous. Where did this silly opinion come from? Blame the Victorians, of course, who lived in a period of English history in the 19th century. That's when some of the silliest theories about green tea arose. One 1882 book described strange experiments to show the harm of green tea. Apply some green tea below a frog's stomach, and you could cause paralysis   in its legs, the book claimed. And injecting green tea into a dog would cause it to lose control of its legs and tail. The book went so far as to declare that green tea could kill someone. At that time, a green tea panic was sweeping England. Even Charlotte Bronte, a famous English writer, refused to touch the drink, fearing its terrible effects it would have on her nerves. Some of the fear was well reasonable, though. English consumers preferred brighter leaves, over dull olive- color1ed ones. As a result, tea sellers would dye   their products, using anything including poisons like \"Prussian blue\". Even today, mixing green tea with chemicals remains a problem.

Jeb put his bag down quickly and pulled his jacket open with both hands, making himself look big to the cougar. It worked. The cougar hesitated, ready to attack Jeb, but ready to forget the whole thing, too. Jeb let go of his jacket, grasped Tom and held him across his body, making a cross. Now the cougar's enemy looked even bigger, and it rose up, ready to move away, but unfortunately Tom got scared and struggled free of Jeb. \"Tom, no!\" shouted his father. But Tom broke and ran and that's the last thing you do with a cougar. The second Tom broke free, Jeb threw himself on the cougar, just as it jumped from the rock. They hit each other in mid-air and both fell. The cougar was on Jeb in a flash, forgetting about Tom, which was what Jeb wanted. Cougars are not as big as most people think and a determined man stands a chance, even with just his fists. As the cougar's claws got into his left shoulder, Jeb swung his fist at its eyes and hit hard. The animal howled and put its head back. Jeb followed up with his other fist. Then out of the corner of his eye, Jeb saw Tom. The boy was running back to help his father. \"Knife, Tom\" shouted Jeb. The boy ran to his father's bag, while Jeb stated shouting as well as hitting, to keep the cougar's attention away from Tom. Tom got the knife and ran over to Jeb.

The event that was organized by a Dutch company called Unexpect, challenged kids to come up with solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems in a day! The day began with the kids listening to the various challenges that were related to their particular cities and towns. The teams were then asked to brainstorm about which problem they were going to handle and how. There were so many amazing ideas produced on that day. While some of the ideas were far from perfect, there were many that could be practical like the smart cars which can ease traffic pressure by telling traffic lights of its arrival and also guiding the drivers to the best possible route . Emer Beamer, the founder of Unexpect, says the purpose of the project is to introduce children to skills they probably never learn in class. She says that for most part, schools focus on teaching things that they will most likely never need to know again. She believes that for kids to be successful in the world, they should be learning how to be creative, handle new technologies and deal with unexpected situations. Though the first global design challenge was relatively small, involving only a few hundred of the two billion youngsters that are bursting with ideas, the next one will be much bigger. That's because in 2015, Unexpect plans to distribute free tool kits  to any school that is interested in hosting their own Children's Designation Challenge.

      "question": "Fish have ears. Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate  . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements   of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. If the passage goes on, it possibly refers to   _  .",

      "question": "The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy   to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses   on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

They used their legs, arms, heads and even shoulders to dance. Many young people still use most of these moves today.

      "question": "7 ways a government shutdown will affect your daily life (CNN) -- Democrats and Republicans were unable to resolve   their differences over Obamacare  and now the government is shut down. The two previous shutdowns -- 1995 and early 1996 -- cost the country $1.4 billion. But what will the shutdown mean for you? Here are 7 ways the government shutdown will affect you. 7. Vacation all I ever wanted: Need to get away? Well, you can't. At least not to national parks. Or to national zoos. Or to national museums. They'll be closed. Were you thinking more along the lines of a trip to France? If you don't already have a passport, you might not get your blue book in time. The last time the government shut down, 200,000 applications for passports went unprocessed. 6. If you drive a car, I'll tax the street: You may be thinking, \"No functioning government, no need to pay taxes.\" Think again. The Man would continue to collect taxes. U.S. bonds would still be issued. And other essential banking functions will go on. 5. Wait a minute, Mr. Postman: You know that whole \"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night\" thing? Apparently, the U.S. Postal Service works through shutdowns as well. Sorry, you won't catch a break from the junk mail. 4. I want a new drug: Oh, the irony  . Republicans still want to _ delay or otherwise withdraw gradually at Obamacare in exchange for funding the government. But the health care act at the center of this storm would continue its process during a shutdown. That is because its funds aren't dependent on the congressional budget   process. 3. Pass the ammunition  : Not so fast. A shutdown would affect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Translation: That gun permit you wanted processed won't happen anytime soon if this goes on for a while. 2. Money (that's what I want): Well, if you owned a small business and needed a loan from the government, you would have to wait, depending on how long this lasts. If you were planning to buy a house and needed a federal loan, you would have to wait. 1. I'm proud to be an American: Perhaps the biggest hit would be to the collective psyche  . America is the largest economy in the world and a beacon for how democracy ought to work. A recent CNN Research Corporation found that 51% would blame Republicans for the shutdown. The United States has operated without a budget since 2009 and has avoided a government shutdown with last-minute deals. Not only did the government run out of money on Tuesday, but the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit and potentially default on its debt in mid-October.

Frost entered Dartmouth University in 1893, but dropped out, and switched to Harvard, which he attended for two years. He started a brief teaching career, where he was inspired to become a poet by some of his students' work. Frost stopped teaching and became a farmer. During this time he wrote numerous poems, and a couple of short stories. While he was a farmer he started to think seriously about becoming a famous poet. In almost all of his poems, Frost wrote in the first person. The first widely-read poem that he published was called My Butterfly. At first his audience was very small, but with his Collected Poems he became famous. Robert Frost received almost all the awards that there were for poetry. His poetry describes the forces of nature, and the violence and deep emotional  needs of human beings, which reflect the experiences of his childhood. Robert Frost will always be known as one of the best poets in history. His way of putting emotion and violence into words is remarkable .

Talent is not enough, because show business is as competitive as any other business .Without a good manager ,a performer can never hope to succeed .Fashion is important in this business, too. The best tailor in the world will never be a success if he makes old-fashioned clothes. In exactly the same way, a performer must change his \"act\" in order to follow the taste of the moment. This is true for actors, dancers and comedians, but perhaps most of all singers. \"Pop\" stands for \"popular\" and a pop singer has to work very hard to become popular .He must either give the public what they already want, or he must find a new way of singing that will attract their attention. Even when he has succeeded, and his records are sold everywhere, he can not relax. Then he must work harder than ever because there are always younger singers trying to become famous and to steal some of the popularity.The life of a successful pop singer is not at all easy. He can only relax when he is alone, because everything he does is watched and reported in the special newspaper written for the \"fans\".

It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value  the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are  respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change.

      "question": "Elephants might be the most well-known and well-loved animal in African wildlife. But conservation   of the African elephant faces special difficulties. While the elephant population is half of what it was 40 years ago, some areas of Africa have more elephants than populated areas can support. That's why AWF scientists are studying elephant behavior, protecting habitats and finding ways for humans to live peacefully with elephants in Africa. Years ago, over hunting and the ivory trade were the biggest threats to elephants survival. Luckily, ivory bans  , hunting rules and protected areas protect elephants from these dangers today. The 21st century brings a different challenge to elephant conservation --land-use. Elephants walk across borders and outside parks and other protected areas. So they often destroy crops, causing conflicts   between local farmers and these big animals. Successful conservation strategies   must allow elephants to walk freely in their natural habitats while reducing conflicts between elephants and local people. AWF researchers are searching for a way to give both elephants and people the space they need. The AWF is collecting information on elephant habitats and behavior. The information they gather will help to develop the widest possible space for elephants. The AWF is helping elephants by protecting their habitats.

      "question": "Work-life balance: Ways to restore harmony and reduce stress Finding work-life balance in today's frenetically paced world is no simple task. Spend more time at work than at home, and you miss out on a rewarding personal life. Then again, when you face challenges in your personal life, such as caring for an aging parent or coping with marital problems, concentrating on your job can be difficult. Whether the problem is too much focus on work or too little, when your work life and your personal life feel out of balance, stress -- along with its harmful effects -- is the result. The good news is that you can take control of your work-life balance -- and give yourself the time to do the things that are most important to you. The first step is to recognize how the world of work has changed. Then you can evaluate your relationship to work and apply some specific strategies for striking a healthier balance. How work invades your personal life There was a time when employees showed up for work Monday through Friday and worked eight- to nine-hour days. The boundaries between work and home were fairly clear then. But the world has changed and, unfortunately, the boundaries have blurred for many workers. Here's why: *Global economy. As more skilled workers enter the global labor market and companies outsource or move more jobs to reduce labor costs, people feel pressured to work longer and produce more just to protect their jobs. *International business. Work continues around the world 24 hours a day for some people. If you work in an international organization, you might be on call around the clock for troubleshooting or consulting. *Advanced communication technology. Many people now have the ability to work anywhere -- from their home, from their car and even on vacation. And some managers expect this. *Longer hours. Employers commonly ask employees to work longer hours than they're scheduled. Often, overtime is mandatory. If you hope to move up the career ladder, you may find yourself regularly working more than 40 hours a week to achieve and exceed expectations. *Changes in family roles. Today's married worker is typically part of a dual-career couple, which makes it difficult to find time to meet commitments to family, friends and community. Married to your work It can be tempting to rack up the hours at work -- especially if you're trying to earn a promotion or some extra money for a child's education or a dream vacation. For others, working more hours feels necessary in order to manage the workload. But if you're spending most of your time at work, your home life will likely pay the price. Consider the pros and cons of working extra hours on your work-life balance: *Fatigue. Your ability to think and your eye-hand coordination decrease when you're tired. This means you're less productive and may make more mistakes. These mistakes can lead to injury or rework and negatively impact your professional reputation. *Family. You may miss out on important events, such as your child's first bike ride, your father's 60th birthday or your high-school reunion. Missing out on important milestones may harm relationships with your loved ones. *Friends. Trusted friends are a key part of your support system. But if you're spending time at the office instead of with them, you'll find it difficult to nurture those friendships. *Expectations. If you regularly work extra hours, you may be given more responsibility. This could create a never-ending and increasing cycle, causing more concerns and challenges. Sometimes working overtime is important. If you work for a company that requires mandatory overtime, you won't be able to avoid it, but you can learn to manage it. Most importantly, say no when you're too tired, when it's affecting your health or when you have crucial family obligations. Striking the best work-life balance  _ With so many demands on your time -- from overtime to family obligations -- it can feel difficult to strike this balance. The goal is to make time for the activities that are the most important to you. Here are some ideas to help you find the balance that's best for you: *Learn to say no. Whether it's a co-worker asking you to spearhead an extra project or your child's teacher asking you to manage the class play, remember that it's OK to respectfully say no. When you quit doing the things you only do out of guilt or a false sense of obligation, you'll make more room in your life for the activities that are meaningful to you and bring you joy. *Leave work at work. Make a conscious decision to separate work time from personal time. When with your family, for instance, turn off your cell phone and put away your laptop computer. *Manage your time. Organize household tasks efficiently. Do one or two loads of laundry every day, rather than saving it all for your day off. A weekly family calendar of important dates and a daily list of to-dos will help you avoid deadline panic. If your employer offers a course in time management, sign up for it. *Get enough sleep. There's nothing as stressful and potentially dangerous as working when you're sleep-deprived. Not only is your productivity affected, but also you can make costly mistakes. You may then have to work even more hours to make up for these mistakes. *Communicate clearly. Limit time-consuming misunderstandings by communicating clearly and listening carefully. Take notes if necessary. *Nurture yourself. Set aside time each day for an activity that you enjoy, such as walking, working out or listening to music. *Set aside one night each week for recreation. Take the phone off the hook, power down the computer and turn off the TV. Discover activities you can do with your partner, family or friends, such as playing golf, fishing or canoeing. Making time for activities you enjoy will rejuvenate you. Remember, striking a work-life balance isn't a one-shot deal. Creating balance in your life is a continuous process. Balance doesn't mean doing everything. Examine your priorities and set boundaries. Be firm in what you can and cannot do. Only you can restore harmony to your lifestyle.

      "question": "Drawing is a universal language. It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it.    In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\"    When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating  the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw.    So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October. Everyone's welcome: all you need is a willingness to express yourself through drawing.    The Big Draw, now in its fifth year, has already achieved two world records: one for the longest drawing in the world (1km) and the other for the greatest number of people drawing at the same time (7,000). This year, there will be an attempt to create a new Guinness World Record for the longest visitors'book: people will be invited to leave their name and a drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper.

      "question": "Leaders of the World Health Organization say they are concerned about the air quality and health efiects on citizens during a recent outbreak of heavy pollution in Beijing.Still,they said they were unsure of the exact amount the air pollution takes on any person's body,casting doubts on local reports tying the area's dirty air to particular cases of illness.    Speaking at a briefing on Tuesday,the WHO's Western Pacific regional director, Shin Young--Soo,cited reports about poor air quality causing lung cancer in recent weeks. \"The WHO is skeptical of the information,\"she said.\"We're cautious of whether the illness is related to air po11ution. We know it has an impact on health,but we don't know how much.\"     The officials didn't cite particular reports.The comments follow a number of articles since late last year connecting some cases of diseases like lung cancer with pollution,.including one in November regarding an 8-year-old girl.    The health impact of Beijing's gray skies has been on the minds of many over the past week. Local authorities on Tuesday preserved an orange alert the city's second highest pollution-warning level--and again warned people to stay indoors.Experts widely agree that small particulates  known as PM2.5 carry significant short-and long-term health risks,particularly with children.Other studies find a certain link between pollution and shorter life spans.  Chinese state media have noted a rise in cancer levels in Beijing,without specifying  whether the new cases are the main result of pollution,smoking,other sources or some combination. Bernhard Schwartlander,the organization's China chief,said he is concerned and has been in contact with national authorities.\"There is no easy solution,\"Dr. Schwartlainder said,adding that solving the problem requires managing industry and the economy.WHO leaders advised citizens.to stay indoors and limit exposure to the harmful particulates.When asked if wearing a face mask has any proven efficacy in preventing health effects of air pollution,Dr. Schwartlainder said,\"Whatever you do,it's better than nothing.\" We can learn from the passage that_.",

      "question": "There was once a tiny pig who lived on a farm. He was a very cute animal, and he knew it. He liked to stay clean and soft and look as good as he could. When he had to go in the mud, he always wore black rain boots, a black rain hat, and a yellow rain coat. This helped keep the mud off. He didn't want it getting on his soft pink skin.  This tiny pig lived with his aunt, who loved to get dirty. \"You shouldn't stay so clean!\" she told him. \"We're pigs! We love the mud!\" But the tiny pig kept wearing his boots, coat, and hat.   One day, all the pigs were standing and eating their lunch. They had corn, oats, apples, and bread, and they all dug in. But the tiny pig wouldn't eat any of it. He had left his bib at home and didn't want to get his clothes dirty. He stood and looked sad as the other pigs ate their fill. They were getting brown mud all over them.  \"Come on,\" said his aunt. \"You can get some bread crumbs on yourself. It's okay.\" But the tiny pig only stood there and looked blue.   Suddenly, a car drove up. The driver was doing too fast and splashed some mud on the tiny pig. The tiny big was sad and mad. But then the people in the car got out.   \"Look at how cute that little muddy pig is!\" said one.   \"He's so cute!\" said the other.   \"Really?\" said the tiny pig.   \"Yes!\" said his aunt. \"For the last time, everybody knows that pigs get muddy!\"  So the tiny pig went and dug in to the food with all the other pigs. He ate a big piece of bread. He got crumbs all over himself. What color rain boots did the tiny pig wear?",

      "question": "Giant pandas are now extremely rare. Their number is less than 1,000 in the wild. The hunting of pandas has been banned for many years, so this is not the problem. Destruction of its habitat, when areas are cleared for growing crops, is one of the main reasons for panda's decline . Another reason is that the bamboo on which they mainly feed, is dying back. The pandas find it difficult to move to new feeding areas. As the bamboo disappears, the pandas simply starve to death.      Bamboo is a poor source of food, and pandas have to eat up 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. The process goes on day and night, with the pandas in a constant cycle of eating for eight hours and sleeping for four. They can eat other foods, but will rather starve than change their diet when bamboo is scarce.    Giant pandas are very good climbers, and use this skill to escape from the enemy. The giant panda lives alone for most of its life, only coming together with another of its species for long enough to mate. A newborn panda baby is born hairless and blind, is about 15cm long and weighs only 100g. The baby will stay with its mother for about 18 months, until it is able to set up its own territory       Chinese and American scientists are studying giant pandas and their habits in order to put in place a major conservation programme. Zoos around the world are taking part in panda breeding programmes. There is still hope that with human's help, the giant panda can survive in the wild. How much bamboo does a panda eat every year?",

      "question": "For several days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the morning he seemed much occupied with business, and in the afternoon gentlemen from the neighborhood called and sometimes stayed to dine with him. When his foot was well enough, he rode out a great deal,and all my knowledge of him was limited to occasional meetings about the house, when he would sometimes pass me coldly, and sometimes bow and smile. His changes of manner did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with the cause of them. One evening, several days later, I was invited to talk to Mr. Rochester after dinner. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes were bright, probably with wine. As I was looking at him, he suddenly turned, and asked me, \"Do you think I'm handsome, Miss Eyre?\" The answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I realized it: \"No, sir.\" \"Ah, you really are unusual! You are a quiet, serious little person, but you can be almost rude.\" \"Sir, I'm sorry. I should have said that beauty doesn't matter, or something like that.\" \"No, you shouldn't! I see, you criticize my appearance, and then you stab  me in the back! You have honesty and feeling. There are not many girls like you.\" I thought to myself that he might have too. He seemed to read my mind, and said quickly, \"Yes, you're right. I have plenty of faults. I went the wrong way when I was twenty-one, and have never found the right path again. I might have been as good as you, and perhaps wiser. I am not a bad man, take my word for it, but I have done wrong. It wasn't my character, but circumstances that were to blame. Why do I tell you all this? Because you're the sort of person people tell their problems and secrets to, and because you're sympathetic and give them hope.\" It seemed he had quite a lot to talk to me. He didn't seem to like to finish the talk quickly, as was the case for the first time. \"Don't be afraid of me, Miss Eyre.\" He continued, \"you don't relax or laugh very much, perhaps because of the effect Lowood school has had on you.  But in time you will be more natural with me, and laugh, and speak freely. You're like a bird in a cage.

      "question": "As a result of pollution, Lake Erie, on the borders of the USA and Canada, is now without many living things. Pollution in water is not simply a matter of \"poisons\" killing large numbers of fish overnight. Very often the effects of pollution are not noticed for many months or years because the first organisms   to be affected are either plants or plankton  . These organisms are the food of fish, birds, and other creatures. When this food disappears, the fish and birds die too. In this way a whole food chain can be wiped out, and it is not until dead fish and water birds are seen at the river's edge or on the sea shore that people realize what is happening. Where do the substances which pollute water come from? There are two main sources, sewage  and industrial waste. As more detergent  is used in homes, more of it is finally put into our rivers, lakes and seas.  Detergents harm water birds by breaking down the natural substances which keep their feathers _ Sewage itself, if not properly treated, makes the water dirty and prevents all forms of life in rivers and the sea from receiving the oxygen they need. Industrial waste is even more harmful since there are many highly poisonous materials in it, such as copper and lead. So if we want to stop this pollution, the answer is simple. Sewage and industrial waste must be made clean before flowing into the water reservoirs. It may already be too late to save some rivers and lakes, but others can still be saved if the correct action is taken at once. Pollution in water is noticed   _  .",

One day her dance teacher tells her to continue eating right, but maybe lose a few pounds. Once Kessa hears this, she takes things too far. Instead of cutting down on snacks and junk food, she decides not to eat at all. She does not eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. She begins losing weight and becomes slimmer   and slimmer. But she loses weight to a point where she is unhealthy. As her poor eating habits continue, her parents start getting as much help as possible to cure   their beautiful daughter. But it is just as hard for Kessa's parents to deal with her disorder as it is for her. Everyday she exercises to lose more pounds and plans what and when she will eat. Her parents try everything, but Kessa decides not to have any fat on her body. Kessa's doctor and parents finally take her to the hospital. She is now so thin that she can hardly walk.

      "question": "Some novels simply entertain and others contain a powerful message in the story line and characters. In his first novel, A Wind In Montana, Mitch Davies tells a story about young adults and how they accept responsibility for their lives. A Wind in Montana is a great tale of two teenagers, Rory Coleman and Victoria Beach, high school students at the same school, who struggle to make the right decision for themselves. As each of them nears adulthood, they become more concerned with the future and set goals that will bring them happiness and a sense of achievement. Without any advice from his parents, Rory chooses to pursue   a profession in chemistry, applies for a chemistry scholarship, and determines to do everything he can to achieve it. Along the path, Rory finds that even though he has a plan, there are obstacles   that could prevent him from realizing his goals. Victoria's struggles are different from Rory's. Although her father has decided that she should become a professional musician, Victoria has other plans for her life. Together, Rory and Victoria attempt to follow their dreams, despite the obstacles in their paths. A Wind In Montana contains a lesson for all teens about to enter adulthood -- that disappointment and setbacks   are going to occur no matter how determined they are and that they need to develop skills along the way that will help them deal with them effectively. Mitch Davies' book stands out among today's teen books that deal with imaginary situations. A Wind In Montana is a real story about real people facing real-life situations.

      "question": "The nuclear leak   at the Fukushima power plant in Japan, which followed the deadly earthquake two weeks ago, has caused an unexpected reaction in China. A sudden panic buying of salt occurred in many areas of our country about a week after the disaster. Salt in these districts was almost bought up overnight. Some sellers wanted to make a fortune by raising the price. The panic buying was caused by two major rumors on the Internet: First, iodized   salt can protect against radiation. Second, there might be a fall in sea-salt production following the nuclear pollution of the ocean. Such fears are not new. The same kind of panic happened with vinegar during the SARS outbreak and garlic in the time of the influenza period.  How can rumors like this spread in such a large country as China? Chen Fang, a reporter with the China Youth Daily said that many Internet users say there is a \"crisis of trust\" in today's China. \"Experts don't have enough credibility and people don't trust all government announcements, either.\" Chen said. However, Chen added that the rumors should not be exaggerated  . Many salt-buyers didn't care; others simply failed to understand what experts and governments were talking about. They just did as their neighbors and friends did. It was a case of the blind following the blind - that was the real reason behind the big increase in the demand for salt.  On March 20, the Ministry of Commerce said: \"The panic buying of salt has stopped and the market is back to normal.\" He also said China has enough salt to satisfy demand. Now everything is back to normal, many want to return the salt they bought. But in the view of the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, \"It is true that these people paid extra money to buy the salt, but they created the crisis in the first place and caused the price to rise.\" The newspaper continued: \"So there is no reason why they should get the money back.\" Perhaps consumers should keep the salt to remind themselves that often rumors are without foundation.

      "question": "When Harvard was founded in 1636, there were no other colleges in the American colonies, and it would become the model for many of those that followed. When it began requiring applicants to take a test known as the SAT in 1935, Harvard started another trend. Two years ago, after it announced an aggressive new financial-aid policy, it helped push social class to the center of the national debate over higher education and forced two of its main competitors, Stanford and Yale, to follow its lead. Last week. Harvard began to make another effort to affect higher education in its image, its president, Derek Bok, announced that the college would abandon its early admissions program, which for decades has allowed high school seniors to apply in October and get an answer yes, no or maybe - in December, shortly before the regular deadline for applications. Harvard officials argue that the program is beneficial to rich students who don't need to compare financial-aid offers from various colleges. After the announcement, many people within education urged other colleges to take a similar step. \"We're thrilled,\" said Laurie Kobick, a college counselor   at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va. \"I think it's going to make admissions better in so many different ways. It will indeed go a small way toward leveling the field among applicants. Of course, it will also have an effect on colleges, and the biggest winner will almost certainly be Harvard. a fact that may prevent many other colleges - perhaps all of them - from       following Hazard this time. Because any college that does so will risk losing some of its best applicants.\" By abandoning early admissions program, Harvard wants   _  .",

      "question": "Most people want to be successful, but never stop to think what it will really take to get there in their chosen field. If it means going back to college for 2 years of night school, could you do it ? If it means reading a book a week for about 6 months in order to really master a new skill ? If you aren't prepared to do any of those things because they are outside of your comfort zone, then you can forget being succesful. I guarantee you will never reach your goals in life, unless your goals are to be ordinary. The biggest killer by far is the dreaded \" comfort zone \" where most people live in their entire life. And the funny thing is that people just can't wrap their heads around the fact that people who have reached some success get tons of time to just relax, but only because they've earned it ! If you haven't built a successful business, or in some way built a career that allow you so much freee time, then you are stuck in the grinding world of nine-to-five jobs everyone else. So how comfortable is that ? So what can you do about it ? Well, find a way to make something happen in your life--- build a business around your favourite hobby, write a book and publish it, or take a course in stock trading and become an expert at that, working on making enough money to retire. If you don't take massive action that puts your way of your comfort zone, you will never be successful at much of anything. I promise--- and I don't make many promises ! Finding real happiness in life can be a mystery for many. That's why I wrote The Road to Happiness for those who want real success and happiness in life, including spirituality and all the gifts life has to offer. Don't wander aimlessly through life.

      "question": "No one likes to make mistakes. But a new study says organizations learn more from their failures than from their successes, and keep that knowledge longer. One of the researchers was Vinit Desai, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. He worked with Peter Madsen from the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University in Utah. They did not find much long-term \"organizational learning\" from success. It is possible, they say. But Professor Desai says they found that knowledge gained from failure lasts for years. He says organizations should treat failures as a learning opportunity and not try to ignore them. The study looked at companies and organizations that launch satellites--and other space vehicles. Professor Desai compared two shuttle flights. In two thousand two, a piece of insulating  material broke off during launch and damaged a rocket on the Atlantis. Still, the flight was considered a success. Then, in early two thousand three, a piece of insulation struck the Columbia during launch. This time, the shuttle broke apart on re-entry and the seven crew members died. NASA officials suspended all flights and an investigation led to suggested changes. Professor Desai says the search for solutions after a failure can make leaders more open-minded. He points to airlines as an example of an industry that has learned from failures in the past. He advises organizations to look for useful information in small failures and failures they avoided. He also urges leaders to encourage the open sharing of information. The study appeared in the Academy of Management Journal. The mistakes we learn from do not have to be our own. We recently asked people on our Facebook page to tell us a time they had done something really silly.

The so-called shopping method has become common practice these days, but that can put your wallet under a lot of pressure. So if you are sad and feel like shopping, don't! According to the recent study, sadness leads to self-focus   thinking. In other words, sad people are willing to spend more money on the same thing than calm people. \"It is the result of sadness and self-focus, and it turns out that sadness leads to an increase in self-focus,\" said Cynthia Cruder. \"What we think is that sad and self-focused people are feeling pretty bad about themselves, and one way to deal with this is buying material goods.\" In a perfect situation, when you know you are sad, you should avoid  making decisions and spending money. Sounds simple? Sadly, it is not. Most people don't even know they're sad, the study shows, and they are not aware that their feelings influence their decisions. What to do?

At that time, the British used \"Dutch\" as a word for something bad, or false.    A Dutch agreement was one made between men who had drunk too much alcohol. Dutch leave was what a soldier took when he left his base without permission.    Some of these old expressions are still used today with a little different meaning. Long ago, a Dutch treat was a dinner at which the invited guests were expected to pay for their own share of food and drink.

If someone told you that you were in Dutch, they mean that you were in trouble.    Some of the Dutch expressions heard in American English have nothing to do with the Dutch people at all.

Sure, there are real dangers connected with all this screen time--everything from cyberbullying  to couch-potato obesity.Not to mention driving while texting, and shortened attention spans . Douglas Gentile, who studies the effects of media on children, says texting, Facebook and video games are not naturally bad.Nor are they naturally better or worse than watching TV, although they do lead to different risks, such as cyberbullying. But research has shown that the more time kids spend in front of screens--whether it's TV or instant-messaging--the worse their school performances are.\"That doesn't mean it's true for every kid, but it makes sense, that for every hour a kid is playing video games, it's an hour that they're not doing homework or reading or exploring or creating,\" he said.If screen time is taking the place of doing their homework, that's bad.But if their homework is done, well, so what? The study also found that the more time kids spend with media, the lower their grades and levels of personal satisfaction are.Gentile said the influence of screen time on school work can be reduced by what he calls \"protective factors\".Those might include good teachers and a high-performing school, love of reading, coming from a family where education is valued.\"If you had all these protective factors, then that one little risk factor, who cares?\" One thing parents should worry about is the way electronic devices encourage multitasking . \"As adults, your response speeds up, you're quicker to look over your shoulder and notice little noises or lights.However this is not what the kids need when they get to the classroom.Scanning to see when the next message comes may not be good for kids.The more distractions  you have, the worse your performance is.\" Getting kids to turn off their phones, iPods in order to let them concentrate  on homework is a fight worth having.

The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \"diseases of civilization\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes  are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C.

      "question": "\"Folk singers are more like poets than singers,\" Li Yahe, a music businessman, once told China Youth Daily. That saying perfectly describes Zhang Lei, the 34-year-old champion of the fourth \"Voice of China\" singing competition, which ended on Oct 7. Critics thought Zhang's success as a victory for folk singers. The Voice of China used to attach great importance to singing skills and vocal techniques, which are not necessarily what folk singers are good at. \"Folk songs are more about emotions and storytelling,\" said Li. Folk is one of the oldest musical styles. It dates back to ancient times, when people sang about their everyday lives and the society around them. A powerful comeback Folk music became popular again in the Western world in the 1960s. During social revolutions, many young Westerners turned to the simple rhythms of folk. Pioneers included US singer Bob Dylan, whose songs are reflections of some social issues like the Vietnam War. Singers at that time used traditional folk instruments like the banjo, the upright bass, the mandolin and the piano. In the late 1970s, folk music was introduced to Taiwan. The rise of singers like Lo Tayu and Chyi Yu popularized folk music, particularly among young Chinese people. At that time, folk tunes were based on simple song structures, with pleasant chord progression and pretty lyrics, just like during old times. But they focused more on the dreams and sorrow of youth than on politics. This continued to be the case when the folk \"wave\" swept Chinese mainland in the 1990s. Folk pioneers Sadly, _ didn't last long in China. Folk gave way to pop in the late 1990s, when people started living more fast-paced lives. But that didn't mean folk music had disappeared from the music world entirely. \"The drop in the popularity of folk songs is because the business mode of the music industry is outdated, not because of the music itself,\" folk singer Song Ke once said. He was right. Recent years have seen folk songs gaining popularity, with the appearance of singers like Li Jian and Song Dongye. \"The popularity of the Internet has shocked the traditional profit model in music industry,\" Lu Zhongqiang, manager of 13-Month, a music recording and publishing company, told Tencent Entertainment. \"Not-so-well-known music starts showing its strength when the production of mainstream music is declining,\" he added.

Cane toads were brought into Australia from Hawaii in 1935 to control the spread ofbeetles  that were destroying Australia's sugar cane crop. _ are now moving into new places at the speed of 30 miles a year. Toads can grow as large as dinner plates and can weigh up to 4.5 pounds. Their heads and backsides are covered with rows ofwarts . They are known to kill snakes, lizards and other animals, including pet dogs. They have no natural enemy in Australia.

Toads use long corridors that are well-suited for them to travel long distances. Another study recently found that toads haveevolved   longer legs in recent years and that this is also helping them in their spread. Efforts to kill toads have been largely unsuccessful, although scientists tried their best. Another new finding suggests ways to slow down its population.

      "question": "If you want to increase your vocabulary, the best way to do it might be to pick up a guitar, or learn the violin. A new study shows that learning to play a musical instrument makes the brain more able to remember words. \"Grown-ups with music training in their childhood can have better memory for words,\" said Dr Agnes Chan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who did the research. \"They can remember things that you tell them better than those who did not have music training when they were young.\" It seems that one can remember spoken words because his brain has a special part. \"That part of the brain is larger in musicians than in non-musicians,\" Dr Chan told BBC. \"If that part of the brain is larger, it may be better developed and so this explains very nicely our results.\" Dr Chan and her workmates came to their conclusion after studying students. Their research is reported in the latest edition of the journal  Nature. \"We did the experiment with 60 girl college students from our university and 30 of them have at least six years training with one western musical instrument (such as the violin and the piano) before the age of 12. The other 30 had received no music training. We tested their memory by reading them some words and asking them to remember these words--a very common test for memory. We found that people who have had music training can remember about 70% more information than those who have not had any music training.\" Dr Chan thinks the process  of learning is more important than the actual instrument used. She also believes if one is able to remember words through learning to play instruments, he or she could have some very real benefits. Dr Chan thinks this could be developed into a medical way for patients who are suffering from memory loss. How many students took part in Dr Chan's research?",

      "question": "Music is often thought of as \"easy\" or \"play time\", but it's not that at all. Music plays a very important part in our education. Students who learn music learn a lot of music history at school. This includes \"modes  \",which were used in churches during the development of music. They are still used today. Students learn about the historical events that were taking place when the music they play was written. They learn what the music was used for. So much of our culture is in music and has been for centuries.  Music also helps with science. Students use science to help them discover what sounds good together and what doesn't. Students also need science to understand something called the \"overtone series\", which is about how music is produced by vibration   and why. Students learn a lot about languages. Many songs are written in other languages, including ancient ones. Students must learn to translate these works to understand what they are singing about. Some songs are famous poems or short works set to music. Students learn a huge amount of coordination   through music, so parts of the body can work better together. Students must use fine motor skills in order to play an instrument. Singers and players must learn breath control and be in good shape to play. Students learn about art. Some famous pieces were written about important works of art, and students learn about the artists and styles as they're playing the music.  Music education also brings higher thinking to our children. It allows them to think about complex patterns (How can I make my part sound better?How do this music and these different parts fit together?). Students have to know absolutely what every other musician does at all times. In that way, it develops teamwork. As one can see, music is very important to education besides bringing us fun.

I chose December 15 as the starting date, which marked three years since my mother died from heart disease. She was one of the most generous people that I have ever known. She always thought of others first and certainly serves as an inspiration to me. I had a rather busy day yesterday, ironic  for someone who is unemployed right now. In the morning I went to the gym, and unsuccessfully got the phone call from the unemployment office for some job searching. Before I knew it, it was noon. I grabbed a quick lunch and rushed down to a meeting. On my way to Connecticut, I wondered if I would see someone that I would feel forced to give my first $10 to. I was running late and decided to do it afterwards. After the meeting I had about half an hour to find the first person of my Year of Giving! I decided to check out Dupont Circle. I had met a guy there named Jerry once and thought he would willingly accept my first $10. He wasn't there, but I did see a man sitting by himself who looked really lonely, so I approached him. Now I had to figure out what I was going to say. I think I said something like, \"Hi, can I sit down here?\" \"I would like to know if I could give you $10?\" He asked me to repeat what I had said. I did, then he looked at me funny, got up and left. I then started walking south where I spotted a man standing by the bus stop on Connecticut Ave. He appeared to be in his 60s. I don't know what drew me to him, but I thought I would make my second attempt. I was a bit nervous and asked him which bus came by that stop. Then I explained that I was starting a year-long project to give $10 to someone every day and that I wanted to give my $10 for today to him. The gentleman, I later found out that his name was Ed, responded without hesitation that he could not accept my offer and that there were many people more deserving the money than him.

      "question": "It was in the Victorian Era   that the novel became the leading form of literature in English. Most writers were more concerned to meet the tastes of the middle class. The best known works of the period included the works of Charles Dickens and the Bronte sisters and others. Charles Dickens came on the literary scene in the 1830s. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and the struggles of the poor. Most of his works were written in a very humorous style, which was popular with readers of all classes. The Bronte sisters were English writers of the 1840s and 1850s. They began to write from early childhood. In 1846 they published the first book at their own expense as poets; however, their book attracted little attention, selling only two copies. Then the sisters turned to writing novels, each producing a novel in the following year. An interest in rural  matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside may be seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy and a number of others. Literature for children developed as a single style. Some works became well-known, such as those of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. Adventure novels were written for adults but are now generally grouped in the list for children. Helen Beatrix Potter was an English author at the end of the Victorian Era, best known for her children's books, which featured (......) animal characters.

Reaching a beach in Trinidad, she became the first woman on record to swim across the Atlantic Ocean--a dream she'd had since the early 1960s,when a stormy transAtlantic   flight got her thinking she could wear a life vest and swim the rest of the way if needed. The 56yearold left the Cape Verde Islands off Africa's western coast on Jan.12,2009, swimming 19 out of 25 days battling waves of up to 30 feet.The distance from Cape Verde to Trinidad is about 700 miles.Crewmembers are still computing exactly how many miles she swam. The original plan was for her to swim to the Bahamas--a distance of about 2,100 miles--but inclement   weather forced her to change her plans and she arrived at Trinidad on Feb.5.She now plans to swim from Trinidad to the British Virgin Islands,ending her voyage at the Bitter End Yacht Club in late February. Her journey came a decade after French swimmer Benoit Lecomte made the first known solo transAtlantic swim,covering nearly 4,000 miles from Massachusetts to France in 73 days.No woman on record had made the crossing. Figge wore a red cap and wet suit,with her only goodluck charm   underneath:an old,red shirt to guard against chafing  ,signed by friends,relatives and her father,who recently died.The other cherished   possession she kept onboard was a picture of Gertrude Ederle,an American who became the first woman to swim across the English Channel.\"We have a few things in common,\"Figge said,\"She wore a red hat and she was of German descent  .We both talked to the sea,and neither one of us wanted to get out.\" When did Benoit Lecomte probably make the first known solo transAtlantic swim?",

This is a simple description of what happens to your body when your kidneys   don't work efficiently. Your body is not thoroughly emptied of waste products. Other areas of the body such as blood pressure and red blood cell production are affected and the _ process that may lead to kidney failure begins. It's not uncommon for people to lose up to 90% of their kidney function before developing any symptoms. There may be no warning signs. This makes early detection   difficult. Kidney's main job is to remove toxins   and unwanted water from our blood. Every day our kidneys clean an average of 200 litres of blood. Kidney failure may be a gradual and silent process, going unnoticed because there is no apparent pain. Research shows that more than 25% of the patients requiring dialysis   do not see a kidney specialist before they have to do so. Some risk factors for kidney disease such as age and genetic make up are out of our control; however, some changes in lifestyle may help prevent kidney damage.Two major risk factors for kidney disease, diabetes   and high blood pressure, have been on the rise over the last few decades.Both conditions are chiefly affected by being overweight and not getting enough exercises, which are the potential risk factors for the kidney disease.

Over the dark land 100 miles below, he saw sparkling lights. It marked the city of Perth, where people had turned on their lights as a greeting to him.    In Friendship 7, Glenn radioed, \"The lights show up very well. Thank everybody for turning them on.\" His capsule moved on to the east.    \"During his three orbits of the earth, Glenn could always reach one of the 18 tracking stations. Some of them were on ships at sea. Others were in theUnited States.    Many of the stations had been built with the help of other countries. These countries allowed  Americans to bring in radio equipment and set it up. Without the help of such lands asNigeria,  Zanzibar andMexico, there would have been breaks in the worldwide radio network. John Glenn, Jr. was the first American to orbit the earth. For his flight, the tracking network covered 60,000  statute miles  . 500 men worked in the stations along the route. Since his flight, the  network has grown. Today, it covers more than 100,000 statute miles and has about 100 stations. One-third of these stations are outside theUnited States. People in the city of Perthturned on lights to   _  .",

We decided to stop at a local gas station to get coffee and something to snack on since it was a good hour and a half before we got home. When we were done, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a man standing outside in front of the building. He was a homeless man with worn clothes and it looked like he had gone in and gotten himself some coffee or something warm to drink since it was cold this time of the year. He must have not had enough money to get something to eat. Then a dog walked up to the front of the building. I could tell she was a \"she\", because you could tell that she had baby dogs. She was terribly in need of something to eat and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her baby dogs would not make it. I and my wife sat there and looked at her. We noticed that people walked by and didn't even pet her, like most people do when they walk by an animal in front of a store. We still did not do anything. But the homeless man, who I thought did not buy himself anything to eat, went back into the store. And what he did brought tears to me and my wife. He had gone into the store and with what money he may have had, bought a can of dog food and fed that dog. This story plays a great part in our lives. You see, that was Mother's Day weekend.

Each year, hundreds of toy companies from across the country come together in New York City. All kinds of products are shown as a way to know what's to come in the new year. This year's trends   include oversize toys. \"In 2014, everything is really big and really out there,\" says Adrienne Appell, a toy-trends expert. Toy Fair is the largest toy trade show in the Western Hemisphere  . Toy-store buyers go to the event to decide which toys they may want to sell during the holiday season. Members of the media, like TFK, go to the fair to report back on all the cool trends. Unfortunately, Toy Fair is not open to the public. This year's Toy Fair was the biggest in its 111-year history. More than 1,000 toy companies showed products from simple card games to high-tech robots. \"Larger Than Life\" was a Toy Fair favorite. This trend is all about big toys with a big play value. Though it is all fun and games at Toy Fair, we saw lots of products making a push towards education, with STEAM. That stands for science, technology, engineering, art, and math. This trend includes word games. And of course, we saw some super cool, high-tech games. \"Technology is always going to influence toys,\" says Appell. \"This year we saw lots of 3D games, and robots.\"[:ZXXK] To know more information about the event, click   here to watch the video.

And, it has made the word \"me\" one of the most frequently used words. Everything seems to be about \"me\". This generation has a greater awareness of itself.  Some people do not seem to agree that all this is self-centred. When Cai Fuchao, prefix = st1 /Beijing's publicity head, was asked to comment on the lack of responsibility of university students during the SARS period, his reply was: \"Modern university students are ambitious, knowledgeable and have a very strong sense of responsibility to the society.\"  As news analyst from sina.com, Pan Fengliang, echoed that, saying that blindly blaming them(for running away during the SARS outbreak)was prejudiced and unfair and not backed with evidence.  No doubt, the development of information technology has contributed its bit to broadening, or bending, the minds of the 80s generation.  Some people even call Gen'80 \"the E-generation\". They get in touch with each other via email, QQ, ICQ and MSN.  While the people of the '60s and '70s swarmed to Shanghai to catch Luo Dayou, Gen'80s were on the BBS saying that it was \"really dumb\".  \"The internet is so much more to those of the '80s than you can imagine,\" said Wu Junyong, an IT engineer who was born in 1978.  In Wu's opinion, it's the Internet that separates the 70s from the 80s, \"Many of the'70s don't see why those from the '80s can spend everyday in front of a computer.\"  A new weekly Magazine/163.com survey last year found that 40 percent of the 7,000 people surveyed, born in the '80s, thought the computer was the most important article in life; more than 70 percent of their parents preferred the home.

Fortunately, researchers at the University of Tokyo are exploring just that. In a show this week, a humanoid with camera eyes made by Kawada Industries Inc. poured tea from a bottle into a cup. Then another robot on wheels delivered the cup of tea in an experimental room that has sensors _ in the floor and sofa as well as cameras on the ceiling, to simulate life with robot technology. \"A human being may be faster, but you'd have to say 'Thank you,'\" said University of Tokyo professor Tomomasa Sato. \"That's the best part about a robot. You don't have to feel bad about asking it to do things.\" Sato believes Japan, a rapidly aging society where more than a fifth of the population is 65 or older, will lead the world in designing robots to care for the elderly, sick and bedridden . Already, monitoring technologies, such as sensors that automatically turn on lights when people enter a room, are becoming widespread in Japan. The walking, child-size Asimo from Honda Motor Co. greets people at showrooms. NEC Corp. has developed a smaller companion robot-on -wheels called Papero. A seal robot available since 2004 can entertain the elderly and others in need of fuzzy companionship. Sato says his experimental room is raising awareness about privacy questions that may arise when electronic devices monitor a person's movements down to the smallest detail. On the bright side, the tea - pouring humanoid has been programmed to do the dishes. Which of the following statements is NOT true?",

I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \"Things haven't worked out,\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists   shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting  the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee.  Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned  inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts   to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature. It's a good thing to reconnect every so often with the Great Outdoors. By Sasha Abramsky With the article, the writer tries to send the message that   _  .",

Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the Earth. On 17 July , a piece four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere   with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the sea bed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards from the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned. Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes are set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero .Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the Earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared.

It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \"great Alachua Savannah.\" Most of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here. A large number of sandhill cranes, hawks and waterfowl are here in winter. The animal _ is increased by the presence of pine flatwoods, hammock, swamps and ponds. The Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park is open year round. The Florida Park Service works hard so that the park will appear as it did in the past. It offers many opportunities for recreation. At the park you can camp and picnic. You can hike and bike. You can boat and fish. You can ride on horse trails. And you can see lots of nature and wildlife. You can see Florida as it was in the early days. Paynes Prairie is a part of our Florida history. It is an example of our Florida natural resources. It is a place for recreation.

        "question": "3D cinema has been around since the early 20th century, but Hollywood brought the technology back in 2007. Many thought it was just a trick to make more money. But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.     But since Avatar, 3D cinema has struggled. In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. In the late 1920s, sound was added to movies, but it took audiences a long time to get used to the new technology. And in the end, sound and color1 became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.     Some say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch, a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.     But James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.     Who knows what the future holds for 3D? Steven Spielberg recently said, \"I'm hoping 3D gets to a point where people don't notice it, because then it is just another tool and helps tell a story.\" The following statements are all incorrect except  _  .",

Grandfather's garden was where I took refuge   from a world of adults and schoolwork. My grandfather cultivated squash   and tomatoes -- it was not rare to find me somewhere in the garden, either secretly eating a tomato, or just sitting and admiring my grandfather's hard work. However, as time went by, I did not have the chance to visit his house as often as I used to. On my eleventh birthday, I received a gift bag wrapped in pretty paper from my grandfather. Excited to see what he had given to me for my birthday, I tore apart the paper only to find a yellow squash. I was very angry. What a stupid present! But gradually, I realized that in my developing a relationship with his garden, I had unknowingly grown very close to my grandfather himself, something he wished to remind me of through his gift. His commitment towards doing things definitely influenced me. It could bring him a sense of accomplishment. Because of him, I try to model the idea of approaching everything with both drive and passion. My grandfather passed away five years ago, but his influence on me could not be bigger than it is today. As I prepare to enter college and move on from my relatively sheltered high school life toward achieving complete independence, allowing my passions to find their way into whatever I may be doing will be very necessary. I still look up to my grandfather very much to this day, and I hope that one day I will be able to sow in my own garden, and give someone else a squash on his or her birthday -- it was the most meaningful gift I have ever received.[:ZXXK] Why did the grandfather send the author a squash?",

        "question": "Green tea is believed to have originated in China thousands of years ago, where it was recognized for its health benefits. And scientists continue to probenew uses for it. Some studies suggest it can help protect against cancer. Thanks to the health food craze, green tea sales are currently rising sharply. The Tea Association of the USA reports that green tea sales jumped more than 60 percent in the last decade. And in Canada, government data shows that profits for green tea imports more than quadrupled  . Nowadays, green tea seems to be everywhere. In shops, you can buy green tea leaves prepared in a number of ways: fried, powdered or steamed. Despite green tea's healthy reputation, the drink was once considered dangerous. Where did this silly opinion come from? Blame the Victorians, of course, who lived in a period of English history in the 19th century. That's when some of the silliest theories about green tea arose. One 1882 book described strange experiments to show the harm of green tea. Apply some green tea below a frog's stomach, and you could cause paralysis   in its legs, the book claimed. And injecting green tea into a dog would cause it to lose control of its legs and tail. The book went so far as to declare that green tea could kill someone. At that time, a green tea panic was sweeping England. Even Charlotte Bronte, a famous English writer, refused to touch the drink, fearing its terrible effects it would have on her nerves. Some of the fear was well reasonable, though. English consumers preferred brighter leaves, over dull olive- color1ed ones. As a result, tea sellers would dye   their products, using anything including poisons like \"Prussian blue\". Even today, mixing green tea with chemicals remains a problem. But those rare instances aren't stopping Westerners from raising their pinky fingers in salute  to green tea and all its nutritional advantages. Bottoms up! What's the best title for the passage?",

Jeb put his bag down quickly and pulled his jacket open with both hands, making himself look big to the cougar. It worked. The cougar hesitated, ready to attack Jeb, but ready to forget the whole thing, too. Jeb let go of his jacket, grasped Tom and held him across his body, making a cross. Now the cougar's enemy looked even bigger, and it rose up, ready to move away, but unfortunately Tom got scared and struggled free of Jeb. \"Tom, no!\" shouted his father. But Tom broke and ran and that's the last thing you do with a cougar. The second Tom broke free, Jeb threw himself on the cougar, just as it jumped from the rock. They hit each other in mid-air and both fell. The cougar was on Jeb in a flash, forgetting about Tom, which was what Jeb wanted. Cougars are not as big as most people think and a determined man stands a chance, even with just his fists. As the cougar's claws got into his left shoulder, Jeb swung his fist at its eyes and hit hard. The animal howled and put its head back. Jeb followed up with his other fist. Then out of the corner of his eye, Jeb saw Tom. The boy was running back to help his father. \"Knife, Tom\" shouted Jeb. The boy ran to his father's bag, while Jeb stated shouting as well as hitting, to keep the cougar's attention away from Tom. Tom got the knife and ran over to Jeb. The cougar was moving its head in and out, trying to find a way through the wall Jeb was making out of his arms. Tom swung with the knife, into the cougar's back.

The event that was organized by a Dutch company called Unexpect, challenged kids to come up with solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems in a day! The day began with the kids listening to the various challenges that were related to their particular cities and towns. The teams were then asked to brainstorm about which problem they were going to handle and how. There were so many amazing ideas produced on that day. While some of the ideas were far from perfect, there were many that could be practical like the smart cars which can ease traffic pressure by telling traffic lights of its arrival and also guiding the drivers to the best possible route . Emer Beamer, the founder of Unexpect, says the purpose of the project is to introduce children to skills they probably never learn in class. She says that for most part, schools focus on teaching things that they will most likely never need to know again. She believes that for kids to be successful in the world, they should be learning how to be creative, handle new technologies and deal with unexpected situations. Though the first global design challenge was relatively small, involving only a few hundred of the two billion youngsters that are bursting with ideas, the next one will be much bigger. That's because in 2015, Unexpect plans to distribute free tool kits  to any school that is interested in hosting their own Children's Designation Challenge.

Michael Sessions, 18, beat former mayor Douglas Ingles, 51, by just two votes and became the new mayor of Hillsdale. He is America's youngest mayor. As Sessions was too young to enter the election in the spring of 2005, he registered- to vote on Sept. 22, one day after his 18-year-old birthday. The day after that he started his write-in campaign, which means he should persuade voters to remember his name and write it by hand on the voting ballots . To help get his name known, Sessions earned$700 by selling apples over the summer. He spent the money on posters and put them on the Hillsdale's lawns. Sessions' month-long campaign included going door to door, explaining his ideas of the town's future in the kitchens of his neighbors. \"They'd look at me, and say'How old are you again? How much experience do you have?'And I say'I'm still in high school', \"he said. Sessions promised Hillsdale's voters he would renew local economy. \"I was hopeful the whole time, \"he explained.

        "question": "Fish have ears. Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate  . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements   of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. If the passage goes on, it possibly refers to   _  .",

        "question": "The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy   to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses   on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

        "question": "7 ways a government shutdown will affect your daily life (CNN) -- Democrats and Republicans were unable to resolve   their differences over Obamacare  and now the government is shut down. The two previous shutdowns -- 1995 and early 1996 -- cost the country $1.4 billion. But what will the shutdown mean for you? Here are 7 ways the government shutdown will affect you. 7. Vacation all I ever wanted: Need to get away? Well, you can't. At least not to national parks. Or to national zoos. Or to national museums. They'll be closed. Were you thinking more along the lines of a trip to France? If you don't already have a passport, you might not get your blue book in time. The last time the government shut down, 200,000 applications for passports went unprocessed. 6. If you drive a car, I'll tax the street: You may be thinking, \"No functioning government, no need to pay taxes.\" Think again. The Man would continue to collect taxes. U.S. bonds would still be issued. And other essential banking functions will go on. 5. Wait a minute, Mr. Postman: You know that whole \"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night\" thing? Apparently, the U.S. Postal Service works through shutdowns as well. Sorry, you won't catch a break from the junk mail. 4. I want a new drug: Oh, the irony  . Republicans still want to _ delay or otherwise withdraw gradually at Obamacare in exchange for funding the government. But the health care act at the center of this storm would continue its process during a shutdown. That is because its funds aren't dependent on the congressional budget   process. 3. Pass the ammunition  : Not so fast. A shutdown would affect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Translation: That gun permit you wanted processed won't happen anytime soon if this goes on for a while. 2. Money (that's what I want): Well, if you owned a small business and needed a loan from the government, you would have to wait, depending on how long this lasts. If you were planning to buy a house and needed a federal loan, you would have to wait. 1. I'm proud to be an American: Perhaps the biggest hit would be to the collective psyche  . America is the largest economy in the world and a beacon for how democracy ought to work. A recent CNN Research Corporation found that 51% would blame Republicans for the shutdown. The United States has operated without a budget since 2009 and has avoided a government shutdown with last-minute deals. Not only did the government run out of money on Tuesday, but the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit and potentially default on its debt in mid-October. Together, they serve as a double whammy  . According to the essay, what led to the shutdown of the American government?",

Frost entered Dartmouth University in 1893, but dropped out, and switched to Harvard, which he attended for two years. He started a brief teaching career, where he was inspired to become a poet by some of his students' work. Frost stopped teaching and became a farmer. During this time he wrote numerous poems, and a couple of short stories. While he was a farmer he started to think seriously about becoming a famous poet. In almost all of his poems, Frost wrote in the first person. The first widely-read poem that he published was called My Butterfly. At first his audience was very small, but with his Collected Poems he became famous. Robert Frost received almost all the awards that there were for poetry. His poetry describes the forces of nature, and the violence and deep emotional  needs of human beings, which reflect the experiences of his childhood. Robert Frost will always be known as one of the best poets in history. His way of putting emotion and violence into words is remarkable .

Talent is not enough, because show business is as competitive as any other business .Without a good manager ,a performer can never hope to succeed .Fashion is important in this business, too. The best tailor in the world will never be a success if he makes old-fashioned clothes. In exactly the same way, a performer must change his \"act\" in order to follow the taste of the moment. This is true for actors, dancers and comedians, but perhaps most of all singers. \"Pop\" stands for \"popular\" and a pop singer has to work very hard to become popular .He must either give the public what they already want, or he must find a new way of singing that will attract their attention. Even when he has succeeded, and his records are sold everywhere, he can not relax. Then he must work harder than ever because there are always younger singers trying to become famous and to steal some of the popularity.The life of a successful pop singer is not at all easy. He can only relax when he is alone, because everything he does is watched and reported in the special newspaper written for the \"fans\". The fans are the most important people in the world for the singers. They buy his records, they go to his concerts and they make him rich and famous. But they can be very annoying, too. Sometimes their enthusiasm get so hysterical that they do anything to get a \"souvenir\" . They steal handkerchiefs, they tear off buttons, and they even cut off pieces of the unfortunate singer's hair. Many singers have been forced to hide.

It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value  the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are  respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change. Much needs to be done to get rid of age discrimination   in employment.Lifelong learning programs need to be provided to enable older people to be active members in a country's development. Social security policies need to be established to provide adequate income protection for older people.Both public and private schemes are vital in order to build a suitable safety net.

While the elephant population is half of what it was 40 years ago, some areas of Africa have more elephants than populated areas can support. That's why AWF scientists are studying elephant behavior, protecting habitats and finding ways for humans to live peacefully with elephants in Africa. Years ago, over hunting and the ivory trade were the biggest threats to elephants survival. Luckily, ivory bans  , hunting rules and protected areas protect elephants from these dangers today. The 21st century brings a different challenge to elephant conservation --land-use. Elephants walk across borders and outside parks and other protected areas. So they often destroy crops, causing conflicts   between local farmers and these big animals. Successful conservation strategies   must allow elephants to walk freely in their natural habitats while reducing conflicts between elephants and local people. AWF researchers are searching for a way to give both elephants and people the space they need. The AWF is collecting information on elephant habitats and behavior. The information they gather will help to develop the widest possible space for elephants. The AWF is helping elephants by protecting their habitats.

        "question": "Work-life balance: Ways to restore harmony and reduce stress Finding work-life balance in today's frenetically paced world is no simple task. Spend more time at work than at home, and you miss out on a rewarding personal life. Then again, when you face challenges in your personal life, such as caring for an aging parent or coping with marital problems, concentrating on your job can be difficult. Whether the problem is too much focus on work or too little, when your work life and your personal life feel out of balance, stress -- along with its harmful effects -- is the result. The good news is that you can take control of your work-life balance -- and give yourself the time to do the things that are most important to you. The first step is to recognize how the world of work has changed. Then you can evaluate your relationship to work and apply some specific strategies for striking a healthier balance. How work invades your personal life There was a time when employees showed up for work Monday through Friday and worked eight- to nine-hour days. The boundaries between work and home were fairly clear then. But the world has changed and, unfortunately, the boundaries have blurred for many workers. Here's why: *Global economy. As more skilled workers enter the global labor market and companies outsource or move more jobs to reduce labor costs, people feel pressured to work longer and produce more just to protect their jobs. *International business. Work continues around the world 24 hours a day for some people. If you work in an international organization, you might be on call around the clock for troubleshooting or consulting. *Advanced communication technology. Many people now have the ability to work anywhere -- from their home, from their car and even on vacation. And some managers expect this. *Longer hours. Employers commonly ask employees to work longer hours than they're scheduled. Often, overtime is mandatory. If you hope to move up the career ladder, you may find yourself regularly working more than 40 hours a week to achieve and exceed expectations. *Changes in family roles. Today's married worker is typically part of a dual-career couple, which makes it difficult to find time to meet commitments to family, friends and community. Married to your work It can be tempting to rack up the hours at work -- especially if you're trying to earn a promotion or some extra money for a child's education or a dream vacation. For others, working more hours feels necessary in order to manage the workload. But if you're spending most of your time at work, your home life will likely pay the price. Consider the pros and cons of working extra hours on your work-life balance: *Fatigue. Your ability to think and your eye-hand coordination decrease when you're tired. This means you're less productive and may make more mistakes. These mistakes can lead to injury or rework and negatively impact your professional reputation. *Family. You may miss out on important events, such as your child's first bike ride, your father's 60th birthday or your high-school reunion. Missing out on important milestones may harm relationships with your loved ones. *Friends. Trusted friends are a key part of your support system. But if you're spending time at the office instead of with them, you'll find it difficult to nurture those friendships. *Expectations. If you regularly work extra hours, you may be given more responsibility. This could create a never-ending and increasing cycle, causing more concerns and challenges. Sometimes working overtime is important. If you work for a company that requires mandatory overtime, you won't be able to avoid it, but you can learn to manage it. Most importantly, say no when you're too tired, when it's affecting your health or when you have crucial family obligations. Striking the best work-life balance  _ With so many demands on your time -- from overtime to family obligations -- it can feel difficult to strike this balance. The goal is to make time for the activities that are the most important to you. Here are some ideas to help you find the balance that's best for you: *Learn to say no. Whether it's a co-worker asking you to spearhead an extra project or your child's teacher asking you to manage the class play, remember that it's OK to respectfully say no. When you quit doing the things you only do out of guilt or a false sense of obligation, you'll make more room in your life for the activities that are meaningful to you and bring you joy. *Leave work at work. Make a conscious decision to separate work time from personal time. When with your family, for instance, turn off your cell phone and put away your laptop computer. *Manage your time. Organize household tasks efficiently. Do one or two loads of laundry every day, rather than saving it all for your day off. A weekly family calendar of important dates and a daily list of to-dos will help you avoid deadline panic. If your employer offers a course in time management, sign up for it. *Get enough sleep. There's nothing as stressful and potentially dangerous as working when you're sleep-deprived. Not only is your productivity affected, but also you can make costly mistakes. You may then have to work even more hours to make up for these mistakes. *Communicate clearly. Limit time-consuming misunderstandings by communicating clearly and listening carefully. Take notes if necessary. *Nurture yourself. Set aside time each day for an activity that you enjoy, such as walking, working out or listening to music. *Set aside one night each week for recreation. Take the phone off the hook, power down the computer and turn off the TV. Discover activities you can do with your partner, family or friends, such as playing golf, fishing or canoeing. Making time for activities you enjoy will rejuvenate you. Remember, striking a work-life balance isn't a one-shot deal. Creating balance in your life is a continuous process. Balance doesn't mean doing everything. Examine your priorities and set boundaries. Be firm in what you can and cannot do. Only you can restore harmony to your lifestyle. What will not happen if you don't get enough sleep?",

        "question": "Drawing is a universal language. It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it.    In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\"    When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating  the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw.    So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October. Everyone's welcome: all you need is a willingness to express yourself through drawing.    The Big Draw, now in its fifth year, has already achieved two world records: one for the longest drawing in the world (1km) and the other for the greatest number of people drawing at the same time (7,000). This year, there will be an attempt to create a new Guinness World Record for the longest visitors'book: people will be invited to leave their name and a drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper.    The theme this year is Inside\\Outside--People, Structure( ) and Spaces, and other events planned include drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper.    The Big Draw is not about turning the nation into artists, it is about helping people to acquire this universal language of communication. Its greatest achievement next October will be to bring hundreds of thousands of people together to look, imagine, draw and have fun. When we were babies we expressed ourselves by  _  .",

        "question": "Leaders of the World Health Organization say they are concerned about the air quality and health efiects on citizens during a recent outbreak of heavy pollution in Beijing.Still,they said they were unsure of the exact amount the air pollution takes on any person's body,casting doubts on local reports tying the area's dirty air to particular cases of illness.    Speaking at a briefing on Tuesday,the WHO's Western Pacific regional director, Shin Young--Soo,cited reports about poor air quality causing lung cancer in recent weeks. \"The WHO is skeptical of the information,\"she said.\"We're cautious of whether the illness is related to air po11ution. We know it has an impact on health,but we don't know how much.\"     The officials didn't cite particular reports.The comments follow a number of articles since late last year connecting some cases of diseases like lung cancer with pollution,.including one in November regarding an 8-year-old girl.    The health impact of Beijing's gray skies has been on the minds of many over the past week. Local authorities on Tuesday preserved an orange alert the city's second highest pollution-warning level--and again warned people to stay indoors.Experts widely agree that small particulates  known as PM2.5 carry significant short-and long-term health risks,particularly with children.Other studies find a certain link between pollution and shorter life spans.  Chinese state media have noted a rise in cancer levels in Beijing,without specifying  whether the new cases are the main result of pollution,smoking,other sources or some combination. Bernhard Schwartlander,the organization's China chief,said he is concerned and has been in contact with national authorities.\"There is no easy solution,\"Dr. Schwartlainder said,adding that solving the problem requires managing industry and the economy.WHO leaders advised citizens.to stay indoors and limit exposure to the harmful particulates.When asked if wearing a face mask has any proven efficacy in preventing health effects of air pollution,Dr. Schwartlainder said,\"Whatever you do,it's better than nothing.\" We can learn from the passage that_.",

When he had to go in the mud, he always wore black rain boots, a black rain hat, and a yellow rain coat. This helped keep the mud off. He didn't want it getting on his soft pink skin.  This tiny pig lived with his aunt, who loved to get dirty. \"You shouldn't stay so clean!\" she told him. \"We're pigs! We love the mud!\" But the tiny pig kept wearing his boots, coat, and hat.   One day, all the pigs were standing and eating their lunch. They had corn, oats, apples, and bread, and they all dug in. But the tiny pig wouldn't eat any of it. He had left his bib at home and didn't want to get his clothes dirty. He stood and looked sad as the other pigs ate their fill. They were getting brown mud all over them.  \"Come on,\" said his aunt. \"You can get some bread crumbs on yourself. It's okay.\" But the tiny pig only stood there and looked blue.   Suddenly, a car drove up. The driver was doing too fast and splashed some mud on the tiny pig. The tiny big was sad and mad. But then the people in the car got out.   \"Look at how cute that little muddy pig is!\" said one.   \"He's so cute!\" said the other.   \"Really?\" said the tiny pig.   \"Yes!\" said his aunt. \"For the last time, everybody knows that pigs get muddy!\"  So the tiny pig went and dug in to the food with all the other pigs. He ate a big piece of bread. He got crumbs all over himself. What color rain boots did the tiny pig wear?",

        "question": "Giant pandas are now extremely rare. Their number is less than 1,000 in the wild. The hunting of pandas has been banned for many years, so this is not the problem. Destruction of its habitat, when areas are cleared for growing crops, is one of the main reasons for panda's decline . Another reason is that the bamboo on which they mainly feed, is dying back. The pandas find it difficult to move to new feeding areas. As the bamboo disappears, the pandas simply starve to death.      Bamboo is a poor source of food, and pandas have to eat up 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. The process goes on day and night, with the pandas in a constant cycle of eating for eight hours and sleeping for four. They can eat other foods, but will rather starve than change their diet when bamboo is scarce.    Giant pandas are very good climbers, and use this skill to escape from the enemy. The giant panda lives alone for most of its life, only coming together with another of its species for long enough to mate. A newborn panda baby is born hairless and blind, is about 15cm long and weighs only 100g. The baby will stay with its mother for about 18 months, until it is able to set up its own territory       Chinese and American scientists are studying giant pandas and their habits in order to put in place a major conservation programme. Zoos around the world are taking part in panda breeding programmes. There is still hope that with human's help, the giant panda can survive in the wild. How much bamboo does a panda eat every year?",

        "question": "For several days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the morning he seemed much occupied with business, and in the afternoon gentlemen from the neighborhood called and sometimes stayed to dine with him. When his foot was well enough, he rode out a great deal,and all my knowledge of him was limited to occasional meetings about the house, when he would sometimes pass me coldly, and sometimes bow and smile. His changes of manner did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with the cause of them. One evening, several days later, I was invited to talk to Mr. Rochester after dinner. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes were bright, probably with wine. As I was looking at him, he suddenly turned, and asked me, \"Do you think I'm handsome, Miss Eyre?\" The answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I realized it: \"No, sir.\" \"Ah, you really are unusual! You are a quiet, serious little person, but you can be almost rude.\" \"Sir, I'm sorry. I should have said that beauty doesn't matter, or something like that.\" \"No, you shouldn't! I see, you criticize my appearance, and then you stab  me in the back! You have honesty and feeling. There are not many girls like you.\" I thought to myself that he might have too. He seemed to read my mind, and said quickly, \"Yes, you're right. I have plenty of faults. I went the wrong way when I was twenty-one, and have never found the right path again. I might have been as good as you, and perhaps wiser. I am not a bad man, take my word for it, but I have done wrong. It wasn't my character, but circumstances that were to blame. Why do I tell you all this? Because you're the sort of person people tell their problems and secrets to, and because you're sympathetic and give them hope.\" It seemed he had quite a lot to talk to me. He didn't seem to like to finish the talk quickly, as was the case for the first time. \"Don't be afraid of me, Miss Eyre.\" He continued, \"you don't relax or laugh very much, perhaps because of the effect Lowood school has had on you.  But in time you will be more natural with me, and laugh, and speak freely. You're like a bird in a cage. When you get out of the cage, you'll fly very high.\" From what Mr. Rochester told Miss Eyre, we can infer that he wanted to  _  .",

        "question": "As a result of pollution, Lake Erie, on the borders of the USA and Canada, is now without many living things. Pollution in water is not simply a matter of \"poisons\" killing large numbers of fish overnight. Very often the effects of pollution are not noticed for many months or years because the first organisms   to be affected are either plants or plankton  . These organisms are the food of fish, birds, and other creatures. When this food disappears, the fish and birds die too. In this way a whole food chain can be wiped out, and it is not until dead fish and water birds are seen at the river's edge or on the sea shore that people realize what is happening. Where do the substances which pollute water come from? There are two main sources, sewage  and industrial waste. As more detergent  is used in homes, more of it is finally put into our rivers, lakes and seas.  Detergents harm water birds by breaking down the natural substances which keep their feathers _ Sewage itself, if not properly treated, makes the water dirty and prevents all forms of life in rivers and the sea from receiving the oxygen they need. Industrial waste is even more harmful since there are many highly poisonous materials in it, such as copper and lead. So if we want to stop this pollution, the answer is simple. Sewage and industrial waste must be made clean before flowing into the water reservoirs. It may already be too late to save some rivers and lakes, but others can still be saved if the correct action is taken at once. Pollution in water is noticed   _  .",

In the beginning of her story, Kessa is a normal 15-year-old. She is good at many things, especially dancing. She has danced for many years and loves it. One day her dance teacher tells her to continue eating right, but maybe lose a few pounds. Once Kessa hears this, she takes things too far. Instead of cutting down on snacks and junk food, she decides not to eat at all. She does not eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. She begins losing weight and becomes slimmer   and slimmer. But she loses weight to a point where she is unhealthy. As her poor eating habits continue, her parents start getting as much help as possible to cure   their beautiful daughter. But it is just as hard for Kessa's parents to deal with her disorder as it is for her. Everyday she exercises to lose more pounds and plans what and when she will eat. Her parents try everything, but Kessa decides not to have any fat on her body. Kessa's doctor and parents finally take her to the hospital. She is now so thin that she can hardly walk. There, she is given good care. In the rest of the book, Kessa goes through a lot of trouble in order to cure her eating disorder. This book, I think, can help to prevent people from doing this to themselves. It shows the trouble that people go through just to be slimmer, and all the terrible things they must experience to be cured. It is a book I think every teenager should read.

In his first novel, A Wind In Montana, Mitch Davies tells a story about young adults and how they accept responsibility for their lives. A Wind in Montana is a great tale of two teenagers, Rory Coleman and Victoria Beach, high school students at the same school, who struggle to make the right decision for themselves. As each of them nears adulthood, they become more concerned with the future and set goals that will bring them happiness and a sense of achievement. Without any advice from his parents, Rory chooses to pursue   a profession in chemistry, applies for a chemistry scholarship, and determines to do everything he can to achieve it. Along the path, Rory finds that even though he has a plan, there are obstacles   that could prevent him from realizing his goals. Victoria's struggles are different from Rory's. Although her father has decided that she should become a professional musician, Victoria has other plans for her life. Together, Rory and Victoria attempt to follow their dreams, despite the obstacles in their paths. A Wind In Montana contains a lesson for all teens about to enter adulthood -- that disappointment and setbacks   are going to occur no matter how determined they are and that they need to develop skills along the way that will help them deal with them effectively. Mitch Davies' book stands out among today's teen books that deal with imaginary situations. A Wind In Montana is a real story about real people facing real-life situations.

        "question": "The nuclear leak   at the Fukushima power plant in Japan, which followed the deadly earthquake two weeks ago, has caused an unexpected reaction in China. A sudden panic buying of salt occurred in many areas of our country about a week after the disaster. Salt in these districts was almost bought up overnight. Some sellers wanted to make a fortune by raising the price. The panic buying was caused by two major rumors on the Internet: First, iodized   salt can protect against radiation. Second, there might be a fall in sea-salt production following the nuclear pollution of the ocean. Such fears are not new. The same kind of panic happened with vinegar during the SARS outbreak and garlic in the time of the influenza period.  How can rumors like this spread in such a large country as China? Chen Fang, a reporter with the China Youth Daily said that many Internet users say there is a \"crisis of trust\" in today's China. \"Experts don't have enough credibility and people don't trust all government announcements, either.\" Chen said. However, Chen added that the rumors should not be exaggerated  . Many salt-buyers didn't care; others simply failed to understand what experts and governments were talking about. They just did as their neighbors and friends did. It was a case of the blind following the blind - that was the real reason behind the big increase in the demand for salt.  On March 20, the Ministry of Commerce said: \"The panic buying of salt has stopped and the market is back to normal.\" He also said China has enough salt to satisfy demand. Now everything is back to normal, many want to return the salt they bought. But in the view of the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, \"It is true that these people paid extra money to buy the salt, but they created the crisis in the first place and caused the price to rise.\" The newspaper continued: \"So there is no reason why they should get the money back.\" Perhaps consumers should keep the salt to remind themselves that often rumors are without foundation.

When it began requiring applicants to take a test known as the SAT in 1935, Harvard started another trend. Two years ago, after it announced an aggressive new financial-aid policy, it helped push social class to the center of the national debate over higher education and forced two of its main competitors, Stanford and Yale, to follow its lead. Last week. Harvard began to make another effort to affect higher education in its image, its president, Derek Bok, announced that the college would abandon its early admissions program, which for decades has allowed high school seniors to apply in October and get an answer yes, no or maybe - in December, shortly before the regular deadline for applications. Harvard officials argue that the program is beneficial to rich students who don't need to compare financial-aid offers from various colleges. After the announcement, many people within education urged other colleges to take a similar step. \"We're thrilled,\" said Laurie Kobick, a college counselor   at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va. \"I think it's going to make admissions better in so many different ways. It will indeed go a small way toward leveling the field among applicants. Of course, it will also have an effect on colleges, and the biggest winner will almost certainly be Harvard. a fact that may prevent many other colleges - perhaps all of them - from       following Hazard this time.

If it means going back to college for 2 years of night school, could you do it ? If it means reading a book a week for about 6 months in order to really master a new skill ? If you aren't prepared to do any of those things because they are outside of your comfort zone, then you can forget being succesful. I guarantee you will never reach your goals in life, unless your goals are to be ordinary. The biggest killer by far is the dreaded \" comfort zone \" where most people live in their entire life. And the funny thing is that people just can't wrap their heads around the fact that people who have reached some success get tons of time to just relax, but only because they've earned it ! If you haven't built a successful business, or in some way built a career that allow you so much freee time, then you are stuck in the grinding world of nine-to-five jobs everyone else. So how comfortable is that ? So what can you do about it ? Well, find a way to make something happen in your life--- build a business around your favourite hobby, write a book and publish it, or take a course in stock trading and become an expert at that, working on making enough money to retire. If you don't take massive action that puts your way of your comfort zone, you will never be successful at much of anything. I promise--- and I don't make many promises !

        "question": "No one likes to make mistakes. But a new study says organizations learn more from their failures than from their successes, and keep that knowledge longer. One of the researchers was Vinit Desai, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. He worked with Peter Madsen from the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University in Utah. They did not find much long-term \"organizational learning\" from success. It is possible, they say. But Professor Desai says they found that knowledge gained from failure lasts for years. He says organizations should treat failures as a learning opportunity and not try to ignore them. The study looked at companies and organizations that launch satellites--and other space vehicles. Professor Desai compared two shuttle flights. In two thousand two, a piece of insulating  material broke off during launch and damaged a rocket on the Atlantis. Still, the flight was considered a success. Then, in early two thousand three, a piece of insulation struck the Columbia during launch. This time, the shuttle broke apart on re-entry and the seven crew members died. NASA officials suspended all flights and an investigation led to suggested changes. Professor Desai says the search for solutions after a failure can make leaders more open-minded. He points to airlines as an example of an industry that has learned from failures in the past. He advises organizations to look for useful information in small failures and failures they avoided. He also urges leaders to encourage the open sharing of information. The study appeared in the Academy of Management Journal. The mistakes we learn from do not have to be our own. We recently asked people on our Facebook page to tell us a time they had done something really silly.

The so-called shopping method has become common practice these days, but that can put your wallet under a lot of pressure. So if you are sad and feel like shopping, don't! According to the recent study, sadness leads to self-focus   thinking. In other words, sad people are willing to spend more money on the same thing than calm people. \"It is the result of sadness and self-focus, and it turns out that sadness leads to an increase in self-focus,\" said Cynthia Cruder. \"What we think is that sad and self-focused people are feeling pretty bad about themselves, and one way to deal with this is buying material goods.\" In a perfect situation, when you know you are sad, you should avoid  making decisions and spending money. Sounds simple? Sadly, it is not. Most people don't even know they're sad, the study shows, and they are not aware that their feelings influence their decisions. What to do? The study showed that those who watched a tragedy  were more likely to spend three times more money for a simple bottle of water than those who watched a comedy.

At that time, the British used \"Dutch\" as a word for something bad, or false.    A Dutch agreement was one made between men who had drunk too much alcohol. Dutch leave was what a soldier took when he left his base without permission.    Some of these old expressions are still used today with a little different meaning.

Now, Dutch treat means that when friends go out to have fun, each person pays his own share.     Another common expression heard a few years ago was \"In Dutch\". If someone told you that you were in Dutch, they mean that you were in trouble.    Some of the Dutch expressions heard in American English have nothing to do with the Dutch people at all.

Sure, there are real dangers connected with all this screen time--everything from cyberbullying  to couch-potato obesity.Not to mention driving while texting, and shortened attention spans . Douglas Gentile, who studies the effects of media on children, says texting, Facebook and video games are not naturally bad.Nor are they naturally better or worse than watching TV, although they do lead to different risks, such as cyberbullying. But research has shown that the more time kids spend in front of screens--whether it's TV or instant-messaging--the worse their school performances are.\"That doesn't mean it's true for every kid, but it makes sense, that for every hour a kid is playing video games, it's an hour that they're not doing homework or reading or exploring or creating,\" he said.If screen time is taking the place of doing their homework, that's bad.But if their homework is done, well, so what? The study also found that the more time kids spend with media, the lower their grades and levels of personal satisfaction are.Gentile said the influence of screen time on school work can be reduced by what he calls \"protective factors\".Those might include good teachers and a high-performing school, love of reading, coming from a family where education is valued.\"If you had all these protective factors, then that one little risk factor, who cares?\" One thing parents should worry about is the way electronic devices encourage multitasking . \"As adults, your response speeds up, you're quicker to look over your shoulder and notice little noises or lights.However this is not what the kids need when they get to the classroom.Scanning to see when the next message comes may not be good for kids.The more distractions  you have, the worse your performance is.\" Getting kids to turn off their phones, iPods in order to let them concentrate  on homework is a fight worth having.

        "question": "Sarah Williams went to a boarding school.  Here is one of the letters she wrote to her parents from the school. Wentworth Girls' School Beachside July 20th Dearest Mom and Dad, I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. I have been very naughty and the school principal is very angry with me. She is going to write to you. You must come and take me away from here. She does not want me in the school any longer. The trouble started last night when I was smoking in bed.  This is against the rules, of course. We are not supposed to smoke at all. As I was smoking, I heard footsteps coming towards the room. I did not want a teacher to catch me smoking, so I threw the cigarette away. Unfortunately, the cigarette fell into the waste-paper basket, which caught fire. There was a curtain near the waste-paper basket which caught fire, too. Soon the whole room was burning. The principal phoned for the fire department. The school is a long way from the town and by the time the fire department arrived, the whole school was in flames. Many of the girls are in the hospital. The principal says that the fire was all my fault and you must pay for the damage. She will send you a bill for about a million dollars. I'm very sorry about this. Much love, Sarah P. S. None of the above is true, but I have failed my exams. I just want you to know how bad things could have been! Why did Sarah tell her parents the story about the fire?",

        "question": "Two American scientists told the people in industrial nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago. The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \"diseases of civilization\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes  are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods.

        "question": "\"Folk singers are more like poets than singers,\" Li Yahe, a music businessman, once told China Youth Daily. That saying perfectly describes Zhang Lei, the 34-year-old champion of the fourth \"Voice of China\" singing competition, which ended on Oct 7. Critics thought Zhang's success as a victory for folk singers. The Voice of China used to attach great importance to singing skills and vocal techniques, which are not necessarily what folk singers are good at. \"Folk songs are more about emotions and storytelling,\" said Li. Folk is one of the oldest musical styles. It dates back to ancient times, when people sang about their everyday lives and the society around them. A powerful comeback Folk music became popular again in the Western world in the 1960s. During social revolutions, many young Westerners turned to the simple rhythms of folk. Pioneers included US singer Bob Dylan, whose songs are reflections of some social issues like the Vietnam War. Singers at that time used traditional folk instruments like the banjo, the upright bass, the mandolin and the piano. In the late 1970s, folk music was introduced to Taiwan. The rise of singers like Lo Tayu and Chyi Yu popularized folk music, particularly among young Chinese people. At that time, folk tunes were based on simple song structures, with pleasant chord progression and pretty lyrics, just like during old times. But they focused more on the dreams and sorrow of youth than on politics. This continued to be the case when the folk \"wave\" swept Chinese mainland in the 1990s. Folk pioneers Sadly, _ didn't last long in China. Folk gave way to pop in the late 1990s, when people started living more fast-paced lives. But that didn't mean folk music had disappeared from the music world entirely. \"The drop in the popularity of folk songs is because the business mode of the music industry is outdated, not because of the music itself,\" folk singer Song Ke once said. He was right. Recent years have seen folk songs gaining popularity, with the appearance of singers like Li Jian and Song Dongye. \"The popularity of the Internet has shocked the traditional profit model in music industry,\" Lu Zhongqiang, manager of 13-Month, a music recording and publishing company, told Tencent Entertainment. \"Not-so-well-known music starts showing its strength when the production of mainstream music is declining,\" he added.

        "question": "In jokes, the chicken only crosses the road. In Australia,cane toads   use roads to travel. A new study finds that Cane toads are using roads to spread across the continent.   They take shelter overnight close to the opencorridors  , and then hit the road each evening in their damaging way. Cane toads were brought into Australia from Hawaii in 1935 to control the spread ofbeetles  that were destroying Australia's sugar cane crop. _ are now moving into new places at the speed of 30 miles a year. Toads can grow as large as dinner plates and can weigh up to 4.5 pounds. Their heads and backsides are covered with rows ofwarts . They are known to kill snakes, lizards and other animals, including pet dogs. They have no natural enemy in Australia. According to a research, toads make slower progress through thick plants than along open spaces and they hop   alongside roads and fences whenever possible. Toads use long corridors that are well-suited for them to travel long distances. Another study recently found that toads haveevolved   longer legs in recent years and that this is also helping them in their spread. Efforts to kill toads have been largely unsuccessful, although scientists tried their best. Another new finding suggests ways to slow down its population.  For example, roadside borders can be changed to make them less attractive to toads, or allowing thick plants to grow along the sides of highways, thus forcing toads onto the road of themselves.

        "question": "If you want to increase your vocabulary, the best way to do it might be to pick up a guitar, or learn the violin. A new study shows that learning to play a musical instrument makes the brain more able to remember words. \"Grown-ups with music training in their childhood can have better memory for words,\" said Dr Agnes Chan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who did the research. \"They can remember things that you tell them better than those who did not have music training when they were young.\" It seems that one can remember spoken words because his brain has a special part. \"That part of the brain is larger in musicians than in non-musicians,\" Dr Chan told BBC. \"If that part of the brain is larger, it may be better developed and so this explains very nicely our results.\" Dr Chan and her workmates came to their conclusion after studying students. Their research is reported in the latest edition of the journal  Nature. \"We did the experiment with 60 girl college students from our university and 30 of them have at least six years training with one western musical instrument (such as the violin and the piano) before the age of 12. The other 30 had received no music training. We tested their memory by reading them some words and asking them to remember these words--a very common test for memory. We found that people who have had music training can remember about 70% more information than those who have not had any music training.\" Dr Chan thinks the process  of learning is more important than the actual instrument used. She also believes if one is able to remember words through learning to play instruments, he or she could have some very real benefits. Dr Chan thinks this could be developed into a medical way for patients who are suffering from memory loss. How many students took part in Dr Chan's research?",

        "question": "Music is often thought of as \"easy\" or \"play time\", but it's not that at all. Music plays a very important part in our education. Students who learn music learn a lot of music history at school. This includes \"modes  \",which were used in churches during the development of music. They are still used today. Students learn about the historical events that were taking place when the music they play was written. They learn what the music was used for. So much of our culture is in music and has been for centuries.  Music also helps with science. Students use science to help them discover what sounds good together and what doesn't. Students also need science to understand something called the \"overtone series\", which is about how music is produced by vibration   and why. Students learn a lot about languages. Many songs are written in other languages, including ancient ones. Students must learn to translate these works to understand what they are singing about. Some songs are famous poems or short works set to music. Students learn a huge amount of coordination   through music, so parts of the body can work better together. Students must use fine motor skills in order to play an instrument. Singers and players must learn breath control and be in good shape to play. Students learn about art. Some famous pieces were written about important works of art, and students learn about the artists and styles as they're playing the music.  Music education also brings higher thinking to our children. It allows them to think about complex patterns (How can I make my part sound better?How do this music and these different parts fit together?). Students have to know absolutely what every other musician does at all times. In that way, it develops teamwork. As one can see, music is very important to education besides bringing us fun.

I chose December 15 as the starting date, which marked three years since my mother died from heart disease. She was one of the most generous people that I have ever known. She always thought of others first and certainly serves as an inspiration to me. I had a rather busy day yesterday, ironic  for someone who is unemployed right now. In the morning I went to the gym, and unsuccessfully got the phone call from the unemployment office for some job searching. Before I knew it, it was noon. I grabbed a quick lunch and rushed down to a meeting. On my way to Connecticut, I wondered if I would see someone that I would feel forced to give my first $10 to. I was running late and decided to do it afterwards. After the meeting I had about half an hour to find the first person of my Year of Giving! I decided to check out Dupont Circle. I had met a guy there named Jerry once and thought he would willingly accept my first $10. He wasn't there, but I did see a man sitting by himself who looked really lonely, so I approached him. Now I had to figure out what I was going to say. I think I said something like, \"Hi, can I sit down here?\" \"I would like to know if I could give you $10?\" He asked me to repeat what I had said. I did, then he looked at me funny, got up and left. I then started walking south where I spotted a man standing by the bus stop on Connecticut Ave. He appeared to be in his 60s. I don't know what drew me to him, but I thought I would make my second attempt. I was a bit nervous and asked him which bus came by that stop. Then I explained that I was starting a year-long project to give $10 to someone every day and that I wanted to give my $10 for today to him. The gentleman, I later found out that his name was Ed, responded without hesitation that he could not accept my offer and that there were many people more deserving the money than him.

        "question": "It was in the Victorian Era   that the novel became the leading form of literature in English. Most writers were more concerned to meet the tastes of the middle class. The best known works of the period included the works of Charles Dickens and the Bronte sisters and others. Charles Dickens came on the literary scene in the 1830s. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and the struggles of the poor. Most of his works were written in a very humorous style, which was popular with readers of all classes. The Bronte sisters were English writers of the 1840s and 1850s. They began to write from early childhood. In 1846 they published the first book at their own expense as poets; however, their book attracted little attention, selling only two copies. Then the sisters turned to writing novels, each producing a novel in the following year. An interest in rural  matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside may be seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy and a number of others. Literature for children developed as a single style. Some works became well-known, such as those of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. Adventure novels were written for adults but are now generally grouped in the list for children. Helen Beatrix Potter was an English author at the end of the Victorian Era, best known for her children's books, which featured (......) animal characters.

      "question": "There was once a tiny pig who lived on a farm. He was a very cute animal, and he knew it. He liked to stay clean and soft and look as good as he could. When he had to go in the mud, he always wore black rain boots, a black rain hat, and a yellow rain coat. This helped keep the mud off. He didn't want it getting on his soft pink skin.  This tiny pig lived with his aunt, who loved to get dirty. \"You shouldn't stay so clean!\" she told him. \"We're pigs! We love the mud!\" But the tiny pig kept wearing his boots, coat, and hat.   One day, all the pigs were standing and eating their lunch. They had corn, oats, apples, and bread, and they all dug in. But the tiny pig wouldn't eat any of it. He had left his bib at home and didn't want to get his clothes dirty. He stood and looked sad as the other pigs ate their fill. They were getting brown mud all over them.  \"Come on,\" said his aunt. \"You can get some bread crumbs on yourself. It's okay.\" But the tiny pig only stood there and looked blue.   Suddenly, a car drove up. The driver was doing too fast and splashed some mud on the tiny pig. The tiny big was sad and mad.

      "question": "The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy   to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses   on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

      "question": "Work-life balance: Ways to restore harmony and reduce stress Finding work-life balance in today's frenetically paced world is no simple task. Spend more time at work than at home, and you miss out on a rewarding personal life. Then again, when you face challenges in your personal life, such as caring for an aging parent or coping with marital problems, concentrating on your job can be difficult. Whether the problem is too much focus on work or too little, when your work life and your personal life feel out of balance, stress -- along with its harmful effects -- is the result. The good news is that you can take control of your work-life balance -- and give yourself the time to do the things that are most important to you. The first step is to recognize how the world of work has changed. Then you can evaluate your relationship to work and apply some specific strategies for striking a healthier balance. How work invades your personal life There was a time when employees showed up for work Monday through Friday and worked eight- to nine-hour days. The boundaries between work and home were fairly clear then. But the world has changed and, unfortunately, the boundaries have blurred for many workers. Here's why: *Global economy. As more skilled workers enter the global labor market and companies outsource or move more jobs to reduce labor costs, people feel pressured to work longer and produce more just to protect their jobs. *International business. Work continues around the world 24 hours a day for some people. If you work in an international organization, you might be on call around the clock for troubleshooting or consulting. *Advanced communication technology. Many people now have the ability to work anywhere -- from their home, from their car and even on vacation. And some managers expect this. *Longer hours. Employers commonly ask employees to work longer hours than they're scheduled. Often, overtime is mandatory. If you hope to move up the career ladder, you may find yourself regularly working more than 40 hours a week to achieve and exceed expectations. *Changes in family roles. Today's married worker is typically part of a dual-career couple, which makes it difficult to find time to meet commitments to family, friends and community. Married to your work It can be tempting to rack up the hours at work -- especially if you're trying to earn a promotion or some extra money for a child's education or a dream vacation. For others, working more hours feels necessary in order to manage the workload. But if you're spending most of your time at work, your home life will likely pay the price. Consider the pros and cons of working extra hours on your work-life balance: *Fatigue. Your ability to think and your eye-hand coordination decrease when you're tired. This means you're less productive and may make more mistakes. These mistakes can lead to injury or rework and negatively impact your professional reputation. *Family. You may miss out on important events, such as your child's first bike ride, your father's 60th birthday or your high-school reunion. Missing out on important milestones may harm relationships with your loved ones. *Friends. Trusted friends are a key part of your support system. But if you're spending time at the office instead of with them, you'll find it difficult to nurture those friendships. *Expectations. If you regularly work extra hours, you may be given more responsibility. This could create a never-ending and increasing cycle, causing more concerns and challenges. Sometimes working overtime is important. If you work for a company that requires mandatory overtime, you won't be able to avoid it, but you can learn to manage it. Most importantly, say no when you're too tired, when it's affecting your health or when you have crucial family obligations. Striking the best work-life balance  _ With so many demands on your time -- from overtime to family obligations -- it can feel difficult to strike this balance. The goal is to make time for the activities that are the most important to you. Here are some ideas to help you find the balance that's best for you: *Learn to say no. Whether it's a co-worker asking you to spearhead an extra project or your child's teacher asking you to manage the class play, remember that it's OK to respectfully say no. When you quit doing the things you only do out of guilt or a false sense of obligation, you'll make more room in your life for the activities that are meaningful to you and bring you joy. *Leave work at work. Make a conscious decision to separate work time from personal time. When with your family, for instance, turn off your cell phone and put away your laptop computer. *Manage your time. Organize household tasks efficiently. Do one or two loads of laundry every day, rather than saving it all for your day off. A weekly family calendar of important dates and a daily list of to-dos will help you avoid deadline panic. If your employer offers a course in time management, sign up for it. *Get enough sleep. There's nothing as stressful and potentially dangerous as working when you're sleep-deprived. Not only is your productivity affected, but also you can make costly mistakes. You may then have to work even more hours to make up for these mistakes. *Communicate clearly. Limit time-consuming misunderstandings by communicating clearly and listening carefully. Take notes if necessary. *Nurture yourself. Set aside time each day for an activity that you enjoy, such as walking, working out or listening to music. *Set aside one night each week for recreation. Take the phone off the hook, power down the computer and turn off the TV. Discover activities you can do with your partner, family or friends, such as playing golf, fishing or canoeing. Making time for activities you enjoy will rejuvenate you. Remember, striking a work-life balance isn't a one-shot deal. Creating balance in your life is a continuous process. Balance doesn't mean doing everything. Examine your priorities and set boundaries. Be firm in what you can and cannot do. Only you can restore harmony to your lifestyle.

      "question": "Imagine your body is like the house you live in. Every day, your family creates rubbish. The rubbish builds up until it is put out for the weekly garbage collection. Now, say you put three bags of garbage out, but because one of the collectors was away sick, only two bags are collected. You take the leftover bag inside to be put out again next week. The following week you put on another three bags, plus the leftover bag from last week. But again, only two bags are collected. Imagine this cycle is repeated over the following weeks. This is a simple description of what happens to your body when your kidneys   don't work efficiently. Your body is not thoroughly emptied of waste products. Other areas of the body such as blood pressure and red blood cell production are affected and the _ process that may lead to kidney failure begins. It's not uncommon for people to lose up to 90% of their kidney function before developing any symptoms. There may be no warning signs. This makes early detection   difficult. Kidney's main job is to remove toxins   and unwanted water from our blood. Every day our kidneys clean an average of 200 litres of blood. Kidney failure may be a gradual and silent process, going unnoticed because there is no apparent pain. Research shows that more than 25% of the patients requiring dialysis   do not see a kidney specialist before they have to do so. Some risk factors for kidney disease such as age and genetic make up are out of our control; however, some changes in lifestyle may help prevent kidney damage.Two major risk factors for kidney disease, diabetes   and high blood pressure, have been on the rise over the last few decades.Both conditions are chiefly affected by being overweight and not getting enough exercises, which are the potential risk factors for the kidney disease.

      "question": "No one likes to make mistakes. But a new study says organizations learn more from their failures than from their successes, and keep that knowledge longer. One of the researchers was Vinit Desai, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. He worked with Peter Madsen from the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University in Utah. They did not find much long-term \"organizational learning\" from success. It is possible, they say. But Professor Desai says they found that knowledge gained from failure lasts for years. He says organizations should treat failures as a learning opportunity and not try to ignore them. The study looked at companies and organizations that launch satellites--and other space vehicles. Professor Desai compared two shuttle flights. In two thousand two, a piece of insulating  material broke off during launch and damaged a rocket on the Atlantis. Still, the flight was considered a success. Then, in early two thousand three, a piece of insulation struck the Columbia during launch. This time, the shuttle broke apart on re-entry and the seven crew members died. NASA officials suspended all flights and an investigation led to suggested changes. Professor Desai says the search for solutions after a failure can make leaders more open-minded. He points to airlines as an example of an industry that has learned from failures in the past. He advises organizations to look for useful information in small failures and failures they avoided. He also urges leaders to encourage the open sharing of information. The study appeared in the Academy of Management Journal. The mistakes we learn from do not have to be our own. We recently asked people on our Facebook page to tell us a time they had done something really silly.

Cane toads were brought into Australia from Hawaii in 1935 to control the spread ofbeetles  that were destroying Australia's sugar cane crop. _ are now moving into new places at the speed of 30 miles a year. Toads can grow as large as dinner plates and can weigh up to 4.5 pounds. Their heads and backsides are covered with rows ofwarts . They are known to kill snakes, lizards and other animals, including pet dogs. They have no natural enemy in Australia. According to a research, toads make slower progress through thick plants than along open spaces and they hop   alongside roads and fences whenever possible. Toads use long corridors that are well-suited for them to travel long distances. Another study recently found that toads haveevolved   longer legs in recent years and that this is also helping them in their spread. Efforts to kill toads have been largely unsuccessful, although scientists tried their best. Another new finding suggests ways to slow down its population.  For example, roadside borders can be changed to make them less attractive to toads, or allowing thick plants to grow along the sides of highways, thus forcing toads onto the road of themselves.

      "question": "Once in a village, the villagers built a new church building and people came from far and wide to see it. They admired its beauty! They said it was the most beautiful building in the world. Up on the roof, a little nail heard the people praising everything about the lovely structure - except the nail! No one even knew he was there, and he became very angry and sad. \"If I am not important, nobody will miss me if I quit!\" So the nail then released   its hold, got down from the roof, and fell into the mud. That night it rained and rained. Soon, the board that had no nail was blown away, and the roof began to leak  . The water flowed down along the walls and over the beautiful pictures on the walls. The plaster   began to fall, the floor was ruined, and the Biblewas also ruined by water. All this was because a little nail decided to quit! But what of the nail? While holding the board, it was not known by others but it was useful. Buried in the mud now, it was useless and would soon be eaten up by rust! What the story wants to say is that every member is important to a whole group! You may, like the nail, feel not important at times, but just like the nail, your absence is felt.

Here, students use the same type of hitech experimental laboratories as those found at universities. In these labs, they conduct experiments and research in new fields of study not found in textbooks. As part of this science course, the students, with the help of Hiroshima University, used a machine called sequencer  , and over the course of a year and a half they succeeded in decoding   the DNA.

Basically, it's an organization which uses professional   footballers to help fight racism in sport and society. A few weeks later, he asked me if I wanted to do a bit more for them. I thought he probably meant for me to give money or do some voluntary work. But then he told me that a group of about 20 people were getting sponsored   to play the highest ever game of rugby   at 5,140 meters on Mount Everest.

Then we walked through some beautiful forest areas before we started a two-hour uphill hike to Namche Bazaar. Day 10 Base camp is basically just a lot of stones and tents. The walk up was really exhausting. Maybe if I was fitter, I wouldn't find this so hard, but then it was not just me -- all of us got very short of breath. Day 11 Today we played our game.

      "question": "\"Folk singers are more like poets than singers,\" Li Yahe, a music businessman, once told China Youth Daily. That saying perfectly describes Zhang Lei, the 34-year-old champion of the fourth \"Voice of China\" singing competition, which ended on Oct 7. Critics thought Zhang's success as a victory for folk singers. The Voice of China used to attach great importance to singing skills and vocal techniques, which are not necessarily what folk singers are good at. \"Folk songs are more about emotions and storytelling,\" said Li. Folk is one of the oldest musical styles. It dates back to ancient times, when people sang about their everyday lives and the society around them. A powerful comeback Folk music became popular again in the Western world in the 1960s. During social revolutions, many young Westerners turned to the simple rhythms of folk. Pioneers included US singer Bob Dylan, whose songs are reflections of some social issues like the Vietnam War. Singers at that time used traditional folk instruments like the banjo, the upright bass, the mandolin and the piano. In the late 1970s, folk music was introduced to Taiwan. The rise of singers like Lo Tayu and Chyi Yu popularized folk music, particularly among young Chinese people. At that time, folk tunes were based on simple song structures, with pleasant chord progression and pretty lyrics, just like during old times. But they focused more on the dreams and sorrow of youth than on politics. This continued to be the case when the folk \"wave\" swept Chinese mainland in the 1990s. Folk pioneers Sadly, _ didn't last long in China. Folk gave way to pop in the late 1990s, when people started living more fast-paced lives. But that didn't mean folk music had disappeared from the music world entirely. \"The drop in the popularity of folk songs is because the business mode of the music industry is outdated, not because of the music itself,\" folk singer Song Ke once said. He was right. Recent years have seen folk songs gaining popularity, with the appearance of singers like Li Jian and Song Dongye. \"The popularity of the Internet has shocked the traditional profit model in music industry,\" Lu Zhongqiang, manager of 13-Month, a music recording and publishing company, told Tencent Entertainment. \"Not-so-well-known music starts showing its strength when the production of mainstream music is declining,\" he added.

Michael Sessions, 18, beat former mayor Douglas Ingles, 51, by just two votes and became the new mayor of Hillsdale. He is America's youngest mayor. As Sessions was too young to enter the election in the spring of 2005, he registered- to vote on Sept. 22, one day after his 18-year-old birthday. The day after that he started his write-in campaign, which means he should persuade voters to remember his name and write it by hand on the voting ballots . To help get his name known, Sessions earned$700 by selling apples over the summer. He spent the money on posters and put them on the Hillsdale's lawns. Sessions' month-long campaign included going door to door, explaining his ideas of the town's future in the kitchens of his neighbors. \"They'd look at me, and say'How old are you again? How much experience do you have?'And I say'I'm still in high school', \"he said. Sessions promised Hillsdale's voters he would renew local economy. \"I was hopeful the whole time, \"he explained.

I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \"Things haven't worked out,\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists   shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting  the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee.  Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned  inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts   to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature.

      "question": "3D cinema has been around since the early 20th century, but Hollywood brought the technology back in 2007. Many thought it was just a trick to make more money. But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.     But since Avatar, 3D cinema has struggled. In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. In the late 1920s, sound was added to movies, but it took audiences a long time to get used to the new technology. And in the end, sound and color1 became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.     Some say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch, a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.     But James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.

The two previous shutdowns -- 1995 and early 1996 -- cost the country $1.4 billion. But what will the shutdown mean for you? Here are 7 ways the government shutdown will affect you. 7. Vacation all I ever wanted: Need to get away? Well, you can't. At least not to national parks. Or to national zoos. Or to national museums. They'll be closed. Were you thinking more along the lines of a trip to France? If you don't already have a passport, you might not get your blue book in time. The last time the government shut down, 200,000 applications for passports went unprocessed. 6. If you drive a car, I'll tax the street: You may be thinking, \"No functioning government, no need to pay taxes.\" Think again. The Man would continue to collect taxes. U.S. bonds would still be issued. And other essential banking functions will go on. 5. Wait a minute, Mr. Postman: You know that whole \"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night\" thing? Apparently, the U.S. Postal Service works through shutdowns as well. Sorry, you won't catch a break from the junk mail. 4. I want a new drug: Oh, the irony  . Republicans still want to _ delay or otherwise withdraw gradually at Obamacare in exchange for funding the government. But the health care act at the center of this storm would continue its process during a shutdown. That is because its funds aren't dependent on the congressional budget   process. 3. Pass the ammunition  : Not so fast. A shutdown would affect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Translation: That gun permit you wanted processed won't happen anytime soon if this goes on for a while. 2. Money (that's what I want): Well, if you owned a small business and needed a loan from the government, you would have to wait, depending on how long this lasts. If you were planning to buy a house and needed a federal loan, you would have to wait. 1. I'm proud to be an American: Perhaps the biggest hit would be to the collective psyche  . America is the largest economy in the world and a beacon for how democracy ought to work. A recent CNN Research Corporation found that 51% would blame Republicans for the shutdown. The United States has operated without a budget since 2009 and has avoided a government shutdown with last-minute deals. Not only did the government run out of money on Tuesday, but the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit and potentially default on its debt in mid-October.

But five to ten percent of kids dislike it so much they don't want to attend. \"If a child seems worried or anxious about school, pretends illness to stay home, or refuses to talk about things of the school day, you should be concerned,\" says a school psychologist, Michael Martin. Fortunately, you can usually solve the problem--sometimes very easily. In our case, my husband and I visited Dustin's class and noticed that the teacher, just out of college, called only on kids who sat right under her nose. Dustin, who often sat near the back, was ignored . We simply told him to move up front. He did, and he was happy again. From the case in the passage we can conclude that   _  .",

      "question": "Two American scientists told the people in industrial nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago. The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \"diseases of civilization\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes  are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods. New kinds of sicknesses have been found because   _",

      "question": "Drawing is a universal language. It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it.    In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\"    When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating  the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw.    So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October. Everyone's welcome: all you need is a willingness to express yourself through drawing.    The Big Draw, now in its fifth year, has already achieved two world records: one for the longest drawing in the world (1km) and the other for the greatest number of people drawing at the same time (7,000). This year, there will be an attempt to create a new Guinness World Record for the longest visitors'book: people will be invited to leave their name and a drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper.    The theme this year is Inside\\Outside--People, Structure( ) and Spaces, and other events planned include drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper.    The Big Draw is not about turning the nation into artists, it is about helping people to acquire this universal language of communication. Its greatest achievement next October will be to bring hundreds of thousands of people together to look, imagine, draw and have fun. When we were babies we expressed ourselves by  _  .",

      "question": "Giant pandas are now extremely rare. Their number is less than 1,000 in the wild. The hunting of pandas has been banned for many years, so this is not the problem. Destruction of its habitat, when areas are cleared for growing crops, is one of the main reasons for panda's decline . Another reason is that the bamboo on which they mainly feed, is dying back. The pandas find it difficult to move to new feeding areas. As the bamboo disappears, the pandas simply starve to death.      Bamboo is a poor source of food, and pandas have to eat up 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. The process goes on day and night, with the pandas in a constant cycle of eating for eight hours and sleeping for four. They can eat other foods, but will rather starve than change their diet when bamboo is scarce.    Giant pandas are very good climbers, and use this skill to escape from the enemy. The giant panda lives alone for most of its life, only coming together with another of its species for long enough to mate. A newborn panda baby is born hairless and blind, is about 15cm long and weighs only 100g. The baby will stay with its mother for about 18 months, until it is able to set up its own territory       Chinese and American scientists are studying giant pandas and their habits in order to put in place a major conservation programme. Zoos around the world are taking part in panda breeding programmes. There is still hope that with human's help, the giant panda can survive in the wild. How much bamboo does a panda eat every year?",

      "question": "The nuclear leak   at the Fukushima power plant in Japan, which followed the deadly earthquake two weeks ago, has caused an unexpected reaction in China. A sudden panic buying of salt occurred in many areas of our country about a week after the disaster. Salt in these districts was almost bought up overnight. Some sellers wanted to make a fortune by raising the price. The panic buying was caused by two major rumors on the Internet: First, iodized   salt can protect against radiation. Second, there might be a fall in sea-salt production following the nuclear pollution of the ocean. Such fears are not new. The same kind of panic happened with vinegar during the SARS outbreak and garlic in the time of the influenza period.  How can rumors like this spread in such a large country as China? Chen Fang, a reporter with the China Youth Daily said that many Internet users say there is a \"crisis of trust\" in today's China. \"Experts don't have enough credibility and people don't trust all government announcements, either.\" Chen said. However, Chen added that the rumors should not be exaggerated  . Many salt-buyers didn't care; others simply failed to understand what experts and governments were talking about. They just did as their neighbors and friends did. It was a case of the blind following the blind - that was the real reason behind the big increase in the demand for salt.  On March 20, the Ministry of Commerce said: \"The panic buying of salt has stopped and the market is back to normal.\" He also said China has enough salt to satisfy demand. Now everything is back to normal, many want to return the salt they bought. But in the view of the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, \"It is true that these people paid extra money to buy the salt, but they created the crisis in the first place and caused the price to rise.\" The newspaper continued: \"So there is no reason why they should get the money back.\" Perhaps consumers should keep the salt to remind themselves that often rumors are without foundation.

      "question": "Yesterday I started the Year of Giving, my first day of a year-long journey into exploring the act of giving and the meaning of charity. I chose December 15 as the starting date, which marked three years since my mother died from heart disease. She was one of the most generous people that I have ever known. She always thought of others first and certainly serves as an inspiration to me. I had a rather busy day yesterday, ironic  for someone who is unemployed right now. In the morning I went to the gym, and unsuccessfully got the phone call from the unemployment office for some job searching. Before I knew it, it was noon. I grabbed a quick lunch and rushed down to a meeting. On my way to Connecticut, I wondered if I would see someone that I would feel forced to give my first $10 to. I was running late and decided to do it afterwards. After the meeting I had about half an hour to find the first person of my Year of Giving! I decided to check out Dupont Circle. I had met a guy there named Jerry once and thought he would willingly accept my first $10. He wasn't there, but I did see a man sitting by himself who looked really lonely, so I approached him. Now I had to figure out what I was going to say. I think I said something like, \"Hi, can I sit down here?\" \"I would like to know if I could give you $10?\" He asked me to repeat what I had said. I did, then he looked at me funny, got up and left. I then started walking south where I spotted a man standing by the bus stop on Connecticut Ave. He appeared to be in his 60s. I don't know what drew me to him, but I thought I would make my second attempt. I was a bit nervous and asked him which bus came by that stop. Then I explained that I was starting a year-long project to give $10 to someone every day and that I wanted to give my $10 for today to him. The gentleman, I later found out that his name was Ed, responded without hesitation that he could not accept my offer and that there were many people more deserving the money than him. This was exactly one of the things that I hoped would happen. People would think of others before themselves! In the author's second attempt, the gentleman refused his offer because  _  .",

One day her dance teacher tells her to continue eating right, but maybe lose a few pounds. Once Kessa hears this, she takes things too far. Instead of cutting down on snacks and junk food, she decides not to eat at all. She does not eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. She begins losing weight and becomes slimmer   and slimmer. But she loses weight to a point where she is unhealthy. As her poor eating habits continue, her parents start getting as much help as possible to cure   their beautiful daughter. But it is just as hard for Kessa's parents to deal with her disorder as it is for her. Everyday she exercises to lose more pounds and plans what and when she will eat. Her parents try everything, but Kessa decides not to have any fat on her body. Kessa's doctor and parents finally take her to the hospital. She is now so thin that she can hardly walk.

And, it has made the word \"me\" one of the most frequently used words. Everything seems to be about \"me\". This generation has a greater awareness of itself.  Some people do not seem to agree that all this is self-centred. When Cai Fuchao, prefix = st1 /Beijing's publicity head, was asked to comment on the lack of responsibility of university students during the SARS period, his reply was: \"Modern university students are ambitious, knowledgeable and have a very strong sense of responsibility to the society.\"  As news analyst from sina.com, Pan Fengliang, echoed that, saying that blindly blaming them(for running away during the SARS outbreak)was prejudiced and unfair and not backed with evidence.  No doubt, the development of information technology has contributed its bit to broadening, or bending, the minds of the 80s generation.  Some people even call Gen'80 \"the E-generation\". They get in touch with each other via email, QQ, ICQ and MSN.  While the people of the '60s and '70s swarmed to Shanghai to catch Luo Dayou, Gen'80s were on the BBS saying that it was \"really dumb\".  \"The internet is so much more to those of the '80s than you can imagine,\" said Wu Junyong, an IT engineer who was born in 1978.  In Wu's opinion, it's the Internet that separates the 70s from the 80s, \"Many of the'70s don't see why those from the '80s can spend everyday in front of a computer.\"  A new weekly Magazine/163.com survey last year found that 40 percent of the 7,000 people surveyed, born in the '80s, thought the computer was the most important article in life; more than 70 percent of their parents preferred the home.

      "question": "Music is often thought of as \"easy\" or \"play time\", but it's not that at all. Music plays a very important part in our education. Students who learn music learn a lot of music history at school. This includes \"modes  \",which were used in churches during the development of music. They are still used today. Students learn about the historical events that were taking place when the music they play was written. They learn what the music was used for. So much of our culture is in music and has been for centuries.  Music also helps with science. Students use science to help them discover what sounds good together and what doesn't. Students also need science to understand something called the \"overtone series\", which is about how music is produced by vibration   and why. Students learn a lot about languages. Many songs are written in other languages, including ancient ones. Students must learn to translate these works to understand what they are singing about. Some songs are famous poems or short works set to music. Students learn a huge amount of coordination   through music, so parts of the body can work better together. Students must use fine motor skills in order to play an instrument. Singers and players must learn breath control and be in good shape to play. Students learn about art. Some famous pieces were written about important works of art, and students learn about the artists and styles as they're playing the music.  Music education also brings higher thinking to our children. It allows them to think about complex patterns (How can I make my part sound better?How do this music and these different parts fit together?). Students have to know absolutely what every other musician does at all times. In that way, it develops teamwork. As one can see, music is very important to education besides bringing us fun.

      "question": "Leaders of the World Health Organization say they are concerned about the air quality and health efiects on citizens during a recent outbreak of heavy pollution in Beijing.Still,they said they were unsure of the exact amount the air pollution takes on any person's body,casting doubts on local reports tying the area's dirty air to particular cases of illness.    Speaking at a briefing on Tuesday,the WHO's Western Pacific regional director, Shin Young--Soo,cited reports about poor air quality causing lung cancer in recent weeks. \"The WHO is skeptical of the information,\"she said.\"We're cautious of whether the illness is related to air po11ution. We know it has an impact on health,but we don't know how much.\"     The officials didn't cite particular reports.The comments follow a number of articles since late last year connecting some cases of diseases like lung cancer with pollution,.including one in November regarding an 8-year-old girl.    The health impact of Beijing's gray skies has been on the minds of many over the past week. Local authorities on Tuesday preserved an orange alert the city's second highest pollution-warning level--and again warned people to stay indoors.Experts widely agree that small particulates  known as PM2.5 carry significant short-and long-term health risks,particularly with children.Other studies find a certain link between pollution and shorter life spans.  Chinese state media have noted a rise in cancer levels in Beijing,without specifying  whether the new cases are the main result of pollution,smoking,other sources or some combination. Bernhard Schwartlander,the organization's China chief,said he is concerned and has been in contact with national authorities.\"There is no easy solution,\"Dr. Schwartlainder said,adding that solving the problem requires managing industry and the economy.WHO leaders advised citizens.to stay indoors and limit exposure to the harmful particulates.When asked if wearing a face mask has any proven efficacy in preventing health effects of air pollution,Dr. Schwartlainder said,\"Whatever you do,it's better than nothing.\" We can learn from the passage that_.",

Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the Earth. On 17 July , a piece four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere   with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the sea bed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards from the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned. Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes are set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero .Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years.

      "question": "My grandfather spent most of his life in a turbulent   India. After settling in New York, he took up his true passion: gardening. Grandfather's garden was where I took refuge   from a world of adults and schoolwork. My grandfather cultivated squash   and tomatoes -- it was not rare to find me somewhere in the garden, either secretly eating a tomato, or just sitting and admiring my grandfather's hard work. However, as time went by, I did not have the chance to visit his house as often as I used to. On my eleventh birthday, I received a gift bag wrapped in pretty paper from my grandfather. Excited to see what he had given to me for my birthday, I tore apart the paper only to find a yellow squash. I was very angry. What a stupid present! But gradually, I realized that in my developing a relationship with his garden, I had unknowingly grown very close to my grandfather himself, something he wished to remind me of through his gift. His commitment towards doing things definitely influenced me. It could bring him a sense of accomplishment. Because of him, I try to model the idea of approaching everything with both drive and passion. My grandfather passed away five years ago, but his influence on me could not be bigger than it is today. As I prepare to enter college and move on from my relatively sheltered high school life toward achieving complete independence, allowing my passions to find their way into whatever I may be doing will be very necessary. I still look up to my grandfather very much to this day, and I hope that one day I will be able to sow in my own garden, and give someone else a squash on his or her birthday -- it was the most meaningful gift I have ever received.[:ZXXK] Why did the grandfather send the author a squash?",

      "question": "Most people want to be successful, but never stop to think what it will really take to get there in their chosen field. If it means going back to college for 2 years of night school, could you do it ? If it means reading a book a week for about 6 months in order to really master a new skill ? If you aren't prepared to do any of those things because they are outside of your comfort zone, then you can forget being succesful. I guarantee you will never reach your goals in life, unless your goals are to be ordinary. The biggest killer by far is the dreaded \" comfort zone \" where most people live in their entire life. And the funny thing is that people just can't wrap their heads around the fact that people who have reached some success get tons of time to just relax, but only because they've earned it ! If you haven't built a successful business, or in some way built a career that allow you so much freee time, then you are stuck in the grinding world of nine-to-five jobs everyone else. So how comfortable is that ? So what can you do about it ? Well, find a way to make something happen in your life--- build a business around your favourite hobby, write a book and publish it, or take a course in stock trading and become an expert at that, working on making enough money to retire. If you don't take massive action that puts your way of your comfort zone, you will never be successful at much of anything. I promise--- and I don't make many promises !

Frost entered Dartmouth University in 1893, but dropped out, and switched to Harvard, which he attended for two years. He started a brief teaching career, where he was inspired to become a poet by some of his students' work. Frost stopped teaching and became a farmer. During this time he wrote numerous poems, and a couple of short stories. While he was a farmer he started to think seriously about becoming a famous poet. In almost all of his poems, Frost wrote in the first person. The first widely-read poem that he published was called My Butterfly. At first his audience was very small, but with his Collected Poems he became famous. Robert Frost received almost all the awards that there were for poetry. His poetry describes the forces of nature, and the violence and deep emotional  needs of human beings, which reflect the experiences of his childhood. Robert Frost will always be known as one of the best poets in history. His way of putting emotion and violence into words is remarkable .

      "question": "It was in the Victorian Era   that the novel became the leading form of literature in English. Most writers were more concerned to meet the tastes of the middle class. The best known works of the period included the works of Charles Dickens and the Bronte sisters and others. Charles Dickens came on the literary scene in the 1830s. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and the struggles of the poor. Most of his works were written in a very humorous style, which was popular with readers of all classes. The Bronte sisters were English writers of the 1840s and 1850s. They began to write from early childhood. In 1846 they published the first book at their own expense as poets; however, their book attracted little attention, selling only two copies. Then the sisters turned to writing novels, each producing a novel in the following year. An interest in rural  matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside may be seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy and a number of others. Literature for children developed as a single style. Some works became well-known, such as those of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. Adventure novels were written for adults but are now generally grouped in the list for children. Helen Beatrix Potter was an English author at the end of the Victorian Era, best known for her children's books, which featured (......) animal characters.

      "question": "Have you ever heard of Paynes Prairie? It is one of the most important natural and historical areas in Florida. Paynes Prairie is located near Gainesville. It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \"great Alachua Savannah.\" Most of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here. A large number of sandhill cranes, hawks and waterfowl are here in winter. The animal _ is increased by the presence of pine flatwoods, hammock, swamps and ponds. The Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park is open year round. The Florida Park Service works hard so that the park will appear as it did in the past. It offers many opportunities for recreation. At the park you can camp and picnic. You can hike and bike. You can boat and fish. You can ride on horse trails. And you can see lots of nature and wildlife.

Sure, there are real dangers connected with all this screen time--everything from cyberbullying  to couch-potato obesity.Not to mention driving while texting, and shortened attention spans . Douglas Gentile, who studies the effects of media on children, says texting, Facebook and video games are not naturally bad.Nor are they naturally better or worse than watching TV, although they do lead to different risks, such as cyberbullying. But research has shown that the more time kids spend in front of screens--whether it's TV or instant-messaging--the worse their school performances are.\"That doesn't mean it's true for every kid, but it makes sense, that for every hour a kid is playing video games, it's an hour that they're not doing homework or reading or exploring or creating,\" he said.If screen time is taking the place of doing their homework, that's bad.But if their homework is done, well, so what? The study also found that the more time kids spend with media, the lower their grades and levels of personal satisfaction are.Gentile said the influence of screen time on school work can be reduced by what he calls \"protective factors\".Those might include good teachers and a high-performing school, love of reading, coming from a family where education is valued.\"If you had all these protective factors, then that one little risk factor, who cares?\" One thing parents should worry about is the way electronic devices encourage multitasking . \"As adults, your response speeds up, you're quicker to look over your shoulder and notice little noises or lights.However this is not what the kids need when they get to the classroom.Scanning to see when the next message comes may not be good for kids.The more distractions  you have, the worse your performance is.\" Getting kids to turn off their phones, iPods in order to let them concentrate  on homework is a fight worth having.

The event that was organized by a Dutch company called Unexpect, challenged kids to come up with solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems in a day! The day began with the kids listening to the various challenges that were related to their particular cities and towns. The teams were then asked to brainstorm about which problem they were going to handle and how. There were so many amazing ideas produced on that day. While some of the ideas were far from perfect, there were many that could be practical like the smart cars which can ease traffic pressure by telling traffic lights of its arrival and also guiding the drivers to the best possible route . Emer Beamer, the founder of Unexpect, says the purpose of the project is to introduce children to skills they probably never learn in class. She says that for most part, schools focus on teaching things that they will most likely never need to know again. She believes that for kids to be successful in the world, they should be learning how to be creative, handle new technologies and deal with unexpected situations. Though the first global design challenge was relatively small, involving only a few hundred of the two billion youngsters that are bursting with ideas, the next one will be much bigger. That's because in 2015, Unexpect plans to distribute free tool kits  to any school that is interested in hosting their own Children's Designation Challenge.

The so-called shopping method has become common practice these days, but that can put your wallet under a lot of pressure. So if you are sad and feel like shopping, don't! According to the recent study, sadness leads to self-focus   thinking. In other words, sad people are willing to spend more money on the same thing than calm people. \"It is the result of sadness and self-focus, and it turns out that sadness leads to an increase in self-focus,\" said Cynthia Cruder. \"What we think is that sad and self-focused people are feeling pretty bad about themselves, and one way to deal with this is buying material goods.\" In a perfect situation, when you know you are sad, you should avoid  making decisions and spending money. Sounds simple? Sadly, it is not. Most people don't even know they're sad, the study shows, and they are not aware that their feelings influence their decisions. What to do? The study showed that those who watched a tragedy  were more likely to spend three times more money for a simple bottle of water than those who watched a comedy.

When it began requiring applicants to take a test known as the SAT in 1935, Harvard started another trend. Two years ago, after it announced an aggressive new financial-aid policy, it helped push social class to the center of the national debate over higher education and forced two of its main competitors, Stanford and Yale, to follow its lead. Last week. Harvard began to make another effort to affect higher education in its image, its president, Derek Bok, announced that the college would abandon its early admissions program, which for decades has allowed high school seniors to apply in October and get an answer yes, no or maybe - in December, shortly before the regular deadline for applications. Harvard officials argue that the program is beneficial to rich students who don't need to compare financial-aid offers from various colleges. After the announcement, many people within education urged other colleges to take a similar step. \"We're thrilled,\" said Laurie Kobick, a college counselor   at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va. \"I think it's going to make admissions better in so many different ways. It will indeed go a small way toward leveling the field among applicants.

      "question": "If you want to increase your vocabulary, the best way to do it might be to pick up a guitar, or learn the violin. A new study shows that learning to play a musical instrument makes the brain more able to remember words. \"Grown-ups with music training in their childhood can have better memory for words,\" said Dr Agnes Chan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who did the research. \"They can remember things that you tell them better than those who did not have music training when they were young.\" It seems that one can remember spoken words because his brain has a special part. \"That part of the brain is larger in musicians than in non-musicians,\" Dr Chan told BBC. \"If that part of the brain is larger, it may be better developed and so this explains very nicely our results.\" Dr Chan and her workmates came to their conclusion after studying students. Their research is reported in the latest edition of the journal  Nature. \"We did the experiment with 60 girl college students from our university and 30 of them have at least six years training with one western musical instrument (such as the violin and the piano) before the age of 12. The other 30 had received no music training. We tested their memory by reading them some words and asking them to remember these words--a very common test for memory. We found that people who have had music training can remember about 70% more information than those who have not had any music training.\" Dr Chan thinks the process  of learning is more important than the actual instrument used. She also believes if one is able to remember words through learning to play instruments, he or she could have some very real benefits. Dr Chan thinks this could be developed into a medical way for patients who are suffering from memory loss. How many students took part in Dr Chan's research?",

      "question": "Some novels simply entertain and others contain a powerful message in the story line and characters. In his first novel, A Wind In Montana, Mitch Davies tells a story about young adults and how they accept responsibility for their lives. A Wind in Montana is a great tale of two teenagers, Rory Coleman and Victoria Beach, high school students at the same school, who struggle to make the right decision for themselves. As each of them nears adulthood, they become more concerned with the future and set goals that will bring them happiness and a sense of achievement. Without any advice from his parents, Rory chooses to pursue   a profession in chemistry, applies for a chemistry scholarship, and determines to do everything he can to achieve it. Along the path, Rory finds that even though he has a plan, there are obstacles   that could prevent him from realizing his goals. Victoria's struggles are different from Rory's. Although her father has decided that she should become a professional musician, Victoria has other plans for her life. Together, Rory and Victoria attempt to follow their dreams, despite the obstacles in their paths. A Wind In Montana contains a lesson for all teens about to enter adulthood -- that disappointment and setbacks   are going to occur no matter how determined they are and that they need to develop skills along the way that will help them deal with them effectively. Mitch Davies' book stands out among today's teen books that deal with imaginary situations. A Wind In Montana is a real story about real people facing real-life situations.

Jeb put his bag down quickly and pulled his jacket open with both hands, making himself look big to the cougar. It worked. The cougar hesitated, ready to attack Jeb, but ready to forget the whole thing, too. Jeb let go of his jacket, grasped Tom and held him across his body, making a cross. Now the cougar's enemy looked even bigger, and it rose up, ready to move away, but unfortunately Tom got scared and struggled free of Jeb. \"Tom, no!\" shouted his father. But Tom broke and ran and that's the last thing you do with a cougar. The second Tom broke free, Jeb threw himself on the cougar, just as it jumped from the rock. They hit each other in mid-air and both fell. The cougar was on Jeb in a flash, forgetting about Tom, which was what Jeb wanted. Cougars are not as big as most people think and a determined man stands a chance, even with just his fists. As the cougar's claws got into his left shoulder, Jeb swung his fist at its eyes and hit hard. The animal howled and put its head back. Jeb followed up with his other fist. Then out of the corner of his eye, Jeb saw Tom. The boy was running back to help his father. \"Knife, Tom\" shouted Jeb. The boy ran to his father's bag, while Jeb stated shouting as well as hitting, to keep the cougar's attention away from Tom. Tom got the knife and ran over to Jeb. The cougar was moving its head in and out, trying to find a way through the wall Jeb was making out of his arms. Tom swung with the knife, into the cougar's back. It howled horribly and ran off into the mountains. The whole fight had taken about thirty seconds. How did Jeb try to hold the cougar's attention?",

      "question": "Elephants might be the most well-known and well-loved animal in African wildlife. But conservation   of the African elephant faces special difficulties. While the elephant population is half of what it was 40 years ago, some areas of Africa have more elephants than populated areas can support. That's why AWF scientists are studying elephant behavior, protecting habitats and finding ways for humans to live peacefully with elephants in Africa. Years ago, over hunting and the ivory trade were the biggest threats to elephants survival. Luckily, ivory bans  , hunting rules and protected areas protect elephants from these dangers today. The 21st century brings a different challenge to elephant conservation --land-use. Elephants walk across borders and outside parks and other protected areas. So they often destroy crops, causing conflicts   between local farmers and these big animals. Successful conservation strategies   must allow elephants to walk freely in their natural habitats while reducing conflicts between elephants and local people. AWF researchers are searching for a way to give both elephants and people the space they need. The AWF is collecting information on elephant habitats and behavior. The information they gather will help to develop the widest possible space for elephants. The AWF is helping elephants by protecting their habitats.

Fortunately, researchers at the University of Tokyo are exploring just that. In a show this week, a humanoid with camera eyes made by Kawada Industries Inc. poured tea from a bottle into a cup. Then another robot on wheels delivered the cup of tea in an experimental room that has sensors _ in the floor and sofa as well as cameras on the ceiling, to simulate life with robot technology. \"A human being may be faster, but you'd have to say 'Thank you,'\" said University of Tokyo professor Tomomasa Sato. \"That's the best part about a robot. You don't have to feel bad about asking it to do things.\" Sato believes Japan, a rapidly aging society where more than a fifth of the population is 65 or older, will lead the world in designing robots to care for the elderly, sick and bedridden . Already, monitoring technologies, such as sensors that automatically turn on lights when people enter a room, are becoming widespread in Japan. The walking, child-size Asimo from Honda Motor Co. greets people at showrooms. NEC Corp. has developed a smaller companion robot-on -wheels called Papero. A seal robot available since 2004 can entertain the elderly and others in need of fuzzy companionship.

      "question": "As a result of pollution, Lake Erie, on the borders of the USA and Canada, is now without many living things. Pollution in water is not simply a matter of \"poisons\" killing large numbers of fish overnight. Very often the effects of pollution are not noticed for many months or years because the first organisms   to be affected are either plants or plankton  . These organisms are the food of fish, birds, and other creatures. When this food disappears, the fish and birds die too. In this way a whole food chain can be wiped out, and it is not until dead fish and water birds are seen at the river's edge or on the sea shore that people realize what is happening. Where do the substances which pollute water come from? There are two main sources, sewage  and industrial waste. As more detergent  is used in homes, more of it is finally put into our rivers, lakes and seas.  Detergents harm water birds by breaking down the natural substances which keep their feathers _ Sewage itself, if not properly treated, makes the water dirty and prevents all forms of life in rivers and the sea from receiving the oxygen they need. Industrial waste is even more harmful since there are many highly poisonous materials in it, such as copper and lead. So if we want to stop this pollution, the answer is simple. Sewage and industrial waste must be made clean before flowing into the water reservoirs.

      "question": "For several days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the morning he seemed much occupied with business, and in the afternoon gentlemen from the neighborhood called and sometimes stayed to dine with him. When his foot was well enough, he rode out a great deal,and all my knowledge of him was limited to occasional meetings about the house, when he would sometimes pass me coldly, and sometimes bow and smile. His changes of manner did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with the cause of them. One evening, several days later, I was invited to talk to Mr. Rochester after dinner. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes were bright, probably with wine. As I was looking at him, he suddenly turned, and asked me, \"Do you think I'm handsome, Miss Eyre?\" The answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I realized it: \"No, sir.\" \"Ah, you really are unusual! You are a quiet, serious little person, but you can be almost rude.\" \"Sir, I'm sorry. I should have said that beauty doesn't matter, or something like that.\" \"No, you shouldn't! I see, you criticize my appearance, and then you stab  me in the back! You have honesty and feeling. There are not many girls like you.\" I thought to myself that he might have too. He seemed to read my mind, and said quickly, \"Yes, you're right. I have plenty of faults. I went the wrong way when I was twenty-one, and have never found the right path again. I might have been as good as you, and perhaps wiser. I am not a bad man, take my word for it, but I have done wrong. It wasn't my character, but circumstances that were to blame. Why do I tell you all this? Because you're the sort of person people tell their problems and secrets to, and because you're sympathetic and give them hope.\" It seemed he had quite a lot to talk to me. He didn't seem to like to finish the talk quickly, as was the case for the first time. \"Don't be afraid of me, Miss Eyre.\" He continued, \"you don't relax or laugh very much, perhaps because of the effect Lowood school has had on you.  But in time you will be more natural with me, and laugh, and speak freely. You're like a bird in a cage.

      "question": "The entertainment profession or \"show business\" attracts many young people. Unfortunately, only very few can hope to become famous and successful. Talent is not enough, because show business is as competitive as any other business .Without a good manager ,a performer can never hope to succeed .Fashion is important in this business, too. The best tailor in the world will never be a success if he makes old-fashioned clothes. In exactly the same way, a performer must change his \"act\" in order to follow the taste of the moment. This is true for actors, dancers and comedians, but perhaps most of all singers. \"Pop\" stands for \"popular\" and a pop singer has to work very hard to become popular .He must either give the public what they already want, or he must find a new way of singing that will attract their attention. Even when he has succeeded, and his records are sold everywhere, he can not relax. Then he must work harder than ever because there are always younger singers trying to become famous and to steal some of the popularity.The life of a successful pop singer is not at all easy. He can only relax when he is alone, because everything he does is watched and reported in the special newspaper written for the \"fans\". The fans are the most important people in the world for the singers. They buy his records, they go to his concerts and they make him rich and famous. But they can be very annoying, too. Sometimes their enthusiasm get so hysterical that they do anything to get a \"souvenir\" . They steal handkerchiefs, they tear off buttons, and they even cut off pieces of the unfortunate singer's hair. Many singers have been forced to hide. A pop singer has to spend a lot of money on clothes, because he must always look smart or at any rate different. He must have a luxurious car. And -- most important -- he must always keep smiling for the benefit of his public. For a pop singer , the most important advantage of having fans is that  _  .",

      "question": "There are many older people in the world and there will be many more.A limeknown fact is that over 60 percent of the older people live in developing countries.According to the World Health Organization,by 2020 there will be 1 billion,with over 700 million living in developing countries. It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value  the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are  respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change. Much needs to be done to get rid of age discrimination   in employment.Lifelong learning programs need to be provided to enable older people to be active members in a country's development. Social security policies need to be established to provide adequate income protection for older people.Both public and private schemes are vital in order to build a suitable safety net. To achieve equality in such matters will take considerable time and effort.One thing is sure:there is no time to be lost.

We decided to stop at a local gas station to get coffee and something to snack on since it was a good hour and a half before we got home. When we were done, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a man standing outside in front of the building. He was a homeless man with worn clothes and it looked like he had gone in and gotten himself some coffee or something warm to drink since it was cold this time of the year. He must have not had enough money to get something to eat. Then a dog walked up to the front of the building. I could tell she was a \"she\", because you could tell that she had baby dogs. She was terribly in need of something to eat and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her baby dogs would not make it. I and my wife sat there and looked at her. We noticed that people walked by and didn't even pet her, like most people do when they walk by an animal in front of a store. We still did not do anything. But the homeless man, who I thought did not buy himself anything to eat, went back into the store. And what he did brought tears to me and my wife. He had gone into the store and with what money he may have had, bought a can of dog food and fed that dog. This story plays a great part in our lives. You see, that was Mother's Day weekend.

      "question": "Fish have ears. Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate  . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements   of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. If the passage goes on, it possibly refers to   _  .",

      "question": "Green tea is believed to have originated in China thousands of years ago, where it was recognized for its health benefits. And scientists continue to probenew uses for it. Some studies suggest it can help protect against cancer. Thanks to the health food craze, green tea sales are currently rising sharply. The Tea Association of the USA reports that green tea sales jumped more than 60 percent in the last decade. And in Canada, government data shows that profits for green tea imports more than quadrupled  . Nowadays, green tea seems to be everywhere. In shops, you can buy green tea leaves prepared in a number of ways: fried, powdered or steamed. Despite green tea's healthy reputation, the drink was once considered dangerous. Where did this silly opinion come from? Blame the Victorians, of course, who lived in a period of English history in the 19th century. That's when some of the silliest theories about green tea arose. One 1882 book described strange experiments to show the harm of green tea. Apply some green tea below a frog's stomach, and you could cause paralysis   in its legs, the book claimed. And injecting green tea into a dog would cause it to lose control of its legs and tail. The book went so far as to declare that green tea could kill someone. At that time, a green tea panic was sweeping England. Even Charlotte Bronte, a famous English writer, refused to touch the drink, fearing its terrible effects it would have on her nerves. Some of the fear was well reasonable, though. English consumers preferred brighter leaves, over dull olive- color1ed ones. As a result, tea sellers would dye   their products, using anything including poisons like \"Prussian blue\". Even today, mixing green tea with chemicals remains a problem. But those rare instances aren't stopping Westerners from raising their pinky fingers in salute  to green tea and all its nutritional advantages. Bottoms up! What's the best title for the passage?",

Reaching a beach in Trinidad, she became the first woman on record to swim across the Atlantic Ocean--a dream she'd had since the early 1960s,when a stormy transAtlantic   flight got her thinking she could wear a life vest and swim the rest of the way if needed. The 56yearold left the Cape Verde Islands off Africa's western coast on Jan.12,2009, swimming 19 out of 25 days battling waves of up to 30 feet.The distance from Cape Verde to Trinidad is about 700 miles.Crewmembers are still computing exactly how many miles she swam. The original plan was for her to swim to the Bahamas--a distance of about 2,100 miles--but inclement   weather forced her to change her plans and she arrived at Trinidad on Feb.5.She now plans to swim from Trinidad to the British Virgin Islands,ending her voyage at the Bitter End Yacht Club in late February. Her journey came a decade after French swimmer Benoit Lecomte made the first known solo transAtlantic swim,covering nearly 4,000 miles from Massachusetts to France in 73 days.No woman on record had made the crossing. Figge wore a red cap and wet suit,with her only goodluck charm   underneath:an old,red shirt to guard against chafing  ,signed by friends,relatives and her father,who recently died.The other cherished   possession she kept onboard was a picture of Gertrude Ederle,an American who became the first woman to swim across the English Channel.\"We have a few things in common,\"Figge said,\"She wore a red hat and she was of German descent  .We both talked to the sea,and neither one of us wanted to get out.\" When did Benoit Lecomte probably make the first known solo transAtlantic swim?",

What's four days long, bigger than seven football fields, and filled with thousands of toys? It's Toy Fair 2014! Each year, hundreds of toy companies from across the country come together in New York City. All kinds of products are shown as a way to know what's to come in the new year. This year's trends   include oversize toys. \"In 2014, everything is really big and really out there,\" says Adrienne Appell, a toy-trends expert. Toy Fair is the largest toy trade show in the Western Hemisphere  . Toy-store buyers go to the event to decide which toys they may want to sell during the holiday season. Members of the media, like TFK, go to the fair to report back on all the cool trends. Unfortunately, Toy Fair is not open to the public. This year's Toy Fair was the biggest in its 111-year history. More than 1,000 toy companies showed products from simple card games to high-tech robots. \"Larger Than Life\" was a Toy Fair favorite. This trend is all about big toys with a big play value. Though it is all fun and games at Toy Fair, we saw lots of products making a push towards education, with STEAM. That stands for science, technology, engineering, art, and math. This trend includes word games. And of course, we saw some super cool, high-tech games. \"Technology is always going to influence toys,\" says Appell. \"This year we saw lots of 3D games, and robots.\"[:ZXXK] To know more information about the event, click   here to watch the video.

It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses   on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

        "question": "Work-life balance: Ways to restore harmony and reduce stress Finding work-life balance in today's frenetically paced world is no simple task. Spend more time at work than at home, and you miss out on a rewarding personal life. Then again, when you face challenges in your personal life, such as caring for an aging parent or coping with marital problems, concentrating on your job can be difficult. Whether the problem is too much focus on work or too little, when your work life and your personal life feel out of balance, stress -- along with its harmful effects -- is the result. The good news is that you can take control of your work-life balance -- and give yourself the time to do the things that are most important to you. The first step is to recognize how the world of work has changed. Then you can evaluate your relationship to work and apply some specific strategies for striking a healthier balance. How work invades your personal life There was a time when employees showed up for work Monday through Friday and worked eight- to nine-hour days. The boundaries between work and home were fairly clear then. But the world has changed and, unfortunately, the boundaries have blurred for many workers. Here's why: *Global economy. As more skilled workers enter the global labor market and companies outsource or move more jobs to reduce labor costs, people feel pressured to work longer and produce more just to protect their jobs. *International business. Work continues around the world 24 hours a day for some people. If you work in an international organization, you might be on call around the clock for troubleshooting or consulting. *Advanced communication technology. Many people now have the ability to work anywhere -- from their home, from their car and even on vacation. And some managers expect this. *Longer hours. Employers commonly ask employees to work longer hours than they're scheduled. Often, overtime is mandatory. If you hope to move up the career ladder, you may find yourself regularly working more than 40 hours a week to achieve and exceed expectations. *Changes in family roles. Today's married worker is typically part of a dual-career couple, which makes it difficult to find time to meet commitments to family, friends and community. Married to your work It can be tempting to rack up the hours at work -- especially if you're trying to earn a promotion or some extra money for a child's education or a dream vacation. For others, working more hours feels necessary in order to manage the workload. But if you're spending most of your time at work, your home life will likely pay the price. Consider the pros and cons of working extra hours on your work-life balance: *Fatigue. Your ability to think and your eye-hand coordination decrease when you're tired. This means you're less productive and may make more mistakes. These mistakes can lead to injury or rework and negatively impact your professional reputation. *Family. You may miss out on important events, such as your child's first bike ride, your father's 60th birthday or your high-school reunion. Missing out on important milestones may harm relationships with your loved ones. *Friends. Trusted friends are a key part of your support system. But if you're spending time at the office instead of with them, you'll find it difficult to nurture those friendships. *Expectations. If you regularly work extra hours, you may be given more responsibility. This could create a never-ending and increasing cycle, causing more concerns and challenges. Sometimes working overtime is important. If you work for a company that requires mandatory overtime, you won't be able to avoid it, but you can learn to manage it. Most importantly, say no when you're too tired, when it's affecting your health or when you have crucial family obligations. Striking the best work-life balance  _ With so many demands on your time -- from overtime to family obligations -- it can feel difficult to strike this balance. The goal is to make time for the activities that are the most important to you. Here are some ideas to help you find the balance that's best for you: *Learn to say no. Whether it's a co-worker asking you to spearhead an extra project or your child's teacher asking you to manage the class play, remember that it's OK to respectfully say no. When you quit doing the things you only do out of guilt or a false sense of obligation, you'll make more room in your life for the activities that are meaningful to you and bring you joy. *Leave work at work. Make a conscious decision to separate work time from personal time. When with your family, for instance, turn off your cell phone and put away your laptop computer. *Manage your time. Organize household tasks efficiently. Do one or two loads of laundry every day, rather than saving it all for your day off. A weekly family calendar of important dates and a daily list of to-dos will help you avoid deadline panic. If your employer offers a course in time management, sign up for it. *Get enough sleep. There's nothing as stressful and potentially dangerous as working when you're sleep-deprived. Not only is your productivity affected, but also you can make costly mistakes. You may then have to work even more hours to make up for these mistakes. *Communicate clearly. Limit time-consuming misunderstandings by communicating clearly and listening carefully. Take notes if necessary. *Nurture yourself. Set aside time each day for an activity that you enjoy, such as walking, working out or listening to music. *Set aside one night each week for recreation. Take the phone off the hook, power down the computer and turn off the TV. Discover activities you can do with your partner, family or friends, such as playing golf, fishing or canoeing. Making time for activities you enjoy will rejuvenate you. Remember, striking a work-life balance isn't a one-shot deal. Creating balance in your life is a continuous process. Balance doesn't mean doing everything. Examine your priorities and set boundaries. Be firm in what you can and cannot do. Only you can restore harmony to your lifestyle.

Now, say you put three bags of garbage out, but because one of the collectors was away sick, only two bags are collected. You take the leftover bag inside to be put out again next week. The following week you put on another three bags, plus the leftover bag from last week. But again, only two bags are collected. Imagine this cycle is repeated over the following weeks. This is a simple description of what happens to your body when your kidneys   don't work efficiently. Your body is not thoroughly emptied of waste products. Other areas of the body such as blood pressure and red blood cell production are affected and the _ process that may lead to kidney failure begins. It's not uncommon for people to lose up to 90% of their kidney function before developing any symptoms. There may be no warning signs. This makes early detection   difficult. Kidney's main job is to remove toxins   and unwanted water from our blood. Every day our kidneys clean an average of 200 litres of blood. Kidney failure may be a gradual and silent process, going unnoticed because there is no apparent pain. Research shows that more than 25% of the patients requiring dialysis   do not see a kidney specialist before they have to do so. Some risk factors for kidney disease such as age and genetic make up are out of our control; however, some changes in lifestyle may help prevent kidney damage.Two major risk factors for kidney disease, diabetes   and high blood pressure, have been on the rise over the last few decades.Both conditions are chiefly affected by being overweight and not getting enough exercises, which are the potential risk factors for the kidney disease.

        "question": "No one likes to make mistakes. But a new study says organizations learn more from their failures than from their successes, and keep that knowledge longer. One of the researchers was Vinit Desai, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. He worked with Peter Madsen from the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University in Utah. They did not find much long-term \"organizational learning\" from success. It is possible, they say. But Professor Desai says they found that knowledge gained from failure lasts for years. He says organizations should treat failures as a learning opportunity and not try to ignore them. The study looked at companies and organizations that launch satellites--and other space vehicles. Professor Desai compared two shuttle flights. In two thousand two, a piece of insulating  material broke off during launch and damaged a rocket on the Atlantis. Still, the flight was considered a success. Then, in early two thousand three, a piece of insulation struck the Columbia during launch. This time, the shuttle broke apart on re-entry and the seven crew members died. NASA officials suspended all flights and an investigation led to suggested changes. Professor Desai says the search for solutions after a failure can make leaders more open-minded. He points to airlines as an example of an industry that has learned from failures in the past. He advises organizations to look for useful information in small failures and failures they avoided. He also urges leaders to encourage the open sharing of information. The study appeared in the Academy of Management Journal. The mistakes we learn from do not have to be our own. We recently asked people on our Facebook page to tell us a time they had done something really silly.

They take shelter overnight close to the opencorridors  , and then hit the road each evening in their damaging way. Cane toads were brought into Australia from Hawaii in 1935 to control the spread ofbeetles  that were destroying Australia's sugar cane crop. _ are now moving into new places at the speed of 30 miles a year. Toads can grow as large as dinner plates and can weigh up to 4.5 pounds. Their heads and backsides are covered with rows ofwarts . They are known to kill snakes, lizards and other animals, including pet dogs. They have no natural enemy in Australia. According to a research, toads make slower progress through thick plants than along open spaces and they hop   alongside roads and fences whenever possible. Toads use long corridors that are well-suited for them to travel long distances. Another study recently found that toads haveevolved   longer legs in recent years and that this is also helping them in their spread. Efforts to kill toads have been largely unsuccessful, although scientists tried their best. Another new finding suggests ways to slow down its population.  For example, roadside borders can be changed to make them less attractive to toads, or allowing thick plants to grow along the sides of highways, thus forcing toads onto the road of themselves.

Day 4 We're making our way up to the base camp -- that's where most climbers start their final climb to the top -- and then, we'll play our game. Today we started out at 8 am.

        "question": "\"Folk singers are more like poets than singers,\" Li Yahe, a music businessman, once told China Youth Daily. That saying perfectly describes Zhang Lei, the 34-year-old champion of the fourth \"Voice of China\" singing competition, which ended on Oct 7. Critics thought Zhang's success as a victory for folk singers. The Voice of China used to attach great importance to singing skills and vocal techniques, which are not necessarily what folk singers are good at. \"Folk songs are more about emotions and storytelling,\" said Li. Folk is one of the oldest musical styles. It dates back to ancient times, when people sang about their everyday lives and the society around them. A powerful comeback Folk music became popular again in the Western world in the 1960s. During social revolutions, many young Westerners turned to the simple rhythms of folk. Pioneers included US singer Bob Dylan, whose songs are reflections of some social issues like the Vietnam War. Singers at that time used traditional folk instruments like the banjo, the upright bass, the mandolin and the piano. In the late 1970s, folk music was introduced to Taiwan. The rise of singers like Lo Tayu and Chyi Yu popularized folk music, particularly among young Chinese people. At that time, folk tunes were based on simple song structures, with pleasant chord progression and pretty lyrics, just like during old times. But they focused more on the dreams and sorrow of youth than on politics. This continued to be the case when the folk \"wave\" swept Chinese mainland in the 1990s. Folk pioneers Sadly, _ didn't last long in China. Folk gave way to pop in the late 1990s, when people started living more fast-paced lives. But that didn't mean folk music had disappeared from the music world entirely. \"The drop in the popularity of folk songs is because the business mode of the music industry is outdated, not because of the music itself,\" folk singer Song Ke once said. He was right. Recent years have seen folk songs gaining popularity, with the appearance of singers like Li Jian and Song Dongye. \"The popularity of the Internet has shocked the traditional profit model in music industry,\" Lu Zhongqiang, manager of 13-Month, a music recording and publishing company, told Tencent Entertainment. \"Not-so-well-known music starts showing its strength when the production of mainstream music is declining,\" he added.

Michael Sessions, 18, beat former mayor Douglas Ingles, 51, by just two votes and became the new mayor of Hillsdale. He is America's youngest mayor. As Sessions was too young to enter the election in the spring of 2005, he registered- to vote on Sept. 22, one day after his 18-year-old birthday. The day after that he started his write-in campaign, which means he should persuade voters to remember his name and write it by hand on the voting ballots . To help get his name known, Sessions earned$700 by selling apples over the summer. He spent the money on posters and put them on the Hillsdale's lawns. Sessions' month-long campaign included going door to door, explaining his ideas of the town's future in the kitchens of his neighbors. \"They'd look at me, and say'How old are you again? How much experience do you have?'And I say'I'm still in high school', \"he said. Sessions promised Hillsdale's voters he would renew local economy. \"I was hopeful the whole time, \"he explained. One day he spent so long out on the streets knocking on the doors that he ended up in a hospital emergency room. Sessions said that his schoolwork will not get in the way of his job as a mayor. \"From 7:50 a.m. to 2:30p.m., I'11 be a student. From 3 to 6, I'11 be the mayor of Hillsdale,\" he said. \"He did a very brave thing that couldn't have been easy for him to do, \"said Jack Vettel, a councilman in Hillsdale, a city of 8,200 about 75 miles southwest of Detroit. \"He does care about this town. He's been here all his life. \" Sessions will receive$3, 600 a year during his four-year term, and will work out of his bedroom since the town does not provide the mayor with an office.

        "question": "THE first night in Yosemite had been awful. I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \"Things haven't worked out,\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists   shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting  the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee.  Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned  inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts   to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature.

But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.     But since Avatar, 3D cinema has struggled. In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. In the late 1920s, sound was added to movies, but it took audiences a long time to get used to the new technology. And in the end, sound and color1 became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.     Some say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch, a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.     But James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.

The two previous shutdowns -- 1995 and early 1996 -- cost the country $1.4 billion. But what will the shutdown mean for you? Here are 7 ways the government shutdown will affect you. 7. Vacation all I ever wanted: Need to get away? Well, you can't. At least not to national parks. Or to national zoos. Or to national museums. They'll be closed. Were you thinking more along the lines of a trip to France? If you don't already have a passport, you might not get your blue book in time. The last time the government shut down, 200,000 applications for passports went unprocessed. 6. If you drive a car, I'll tax the street: You may be thinking, \"No functioning government, no need to pay taxes.\" Think again. The Man would continue to collect taxes. U.S. bonds would still be issued. And other essential banking functions will go on. 5. Wait a minute, Mr. Postman: You know that whole \"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night\" thing? Apparently, the U.S. Postal Service works through shutdowns as well. Sorry, you won't catch a break from the junk mail. 4. I want a new drug: Oh, the irony  . Republicans still want to _ delay or otherwise withdraw gradually at Obamacare in exchange for funding the government. But the health care act at the center of this storm would continue its process during a shutdown. That is because its funds aren't dependent on the congressional budget   process. 3. Pass the ammunition  : Not so fast. A shutdown would affect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Translation: That gun permit you wanted processed won't happen anytime soon if this goes on for a while. 2. Money (that's what I want): Well, if you owned a small business and needed a loan from the government, you would have to wait, depending on how long this lasts. If you were planning to buy a house and needed a federal loan, you would have to wait. 1. I'm proud to be an American: Perhaps the biggest hit would be to the collective psyche  . America is the largest economy in the world and a beacon for how democracy ought to work. A recent CNN Research Corporation found that 51% would blame Republicans for the shutdown. The United States has operated without a budget since 2009 and has avoided a government shutdown with last-minute deals. Not only did the government run out of money on Tuesday, but the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit and potentially default on its debt in mid-October.

The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \"diseases of civilization\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes  are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods. New kinds of sicknesses have been found because   _",

        "question": "Drawing is a universal language. It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it.    In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\"    When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating  the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw.    So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October. Everyone's welcome: all you need is a willingness to express yourself through drawing.    The Big Draw, now in its fifth year, has already achieved two world records: one for the longest drawing in the world (1km) and the other for the greatest number of people drawing at the same time (7,000). This year, there will be an attempt to create a new Guinness World Record for the longest visitors'book: people will be invited to leave their name and a drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper.    The theme this year is Inside\\Outside--People, Structure( ) and Spaces, and other events planned include drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper.    The Big Draw is not about turning the nation into artists, it is about helping people to acquire this universal language of communication. Its greatest achievement next October will be to bring hundreds of thousands of people together to look, imagine, draw and have fun. When we were babies we expressed ourselves by  _  .",

        "question": "Giant pandas are now extremely rare. Their number is less than 1,000 in the wild. The hunting of pandas has been banned for many years, so this is not the problem. Destruction of its habitat, when areas are cleared for growing crops, is one of the main reasons for panda's decline . Another reason is that the bamboo on which they mainly feed, is dying back. The pandas find it difficult to move to new feeding areas. As the bamboo disappears, the pandas simply starve to death.      Bamboo is a poor source of food, and pandas have to eat up 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. The process goes on day and night, with the pandas in a constant cycle of eating for eight hours and sleeping for four. They can eat other foods, but will rather starve than change their diet when bamboo is scarce.    Giant pandas are very good climbers, and use this skill to escape from the enemy. The giant panda lives alone for most of its life, only coming together with another of its species for long enough to mate. A newborn panda baby is born hairless and blind, is about 15cm long and weighs only 100g. The baby will stay with its mother for about 18 months, until it is able to set up its own territory       Chinese and American scientists are studying giant pandas and their habits in order to put in place a major conservation programme. Zoos around the world are taking part in panda breeding programmes. There is still hope that with human's help, the giant panda can survive in the wild. How much bamboo does a panda eat every year?",

        "question": "The nuclear leak   at the Fukushima power plant in Japan, which followed the deadly earthquake two weeks ago, has caused an unexpected reaction in China. A sudden panic buying of salt occurred in many areas of our country about a week after the disaster. Salt in these districts was almost bought up overnight. Some sellers wanted to make a fortune by raising the price. The panic buying was caused by two major rumors on the Internet: First, iodized   salt can protect against radiation. Second, there might be a fall in sea-salt production following the nuclear pollution of the ocean. Such fears are not new. The same kind of panic happened with vinegar during the SARS outbreak and garlic in the time of the influenza period.  How can rumors like this spread in such a large country as China? Chen Fang, a reporter with the China Youth Daily said that many Internet users say there is a \"crisis of trust\" in today's China. \"Experts don't have enough credibility and people don't trust all government announcements, either.\" Chen said. However, Chen added that the rumors should not be exaggerated  . Many salt-buyers didn't care; others simply failed to understand what experts and governments were talking about. They just did as their neighbors and friends did. It was a case of the blind following the blind - that was the real reason behind the big increase in the demand for salt.  On March 20, the Ministry of Commerce said: \"The panic buying of salt has stopped and the market is back to normal.\" He also said China has enough salt to satisfy demand. Now everything is back to normal, many want to return the salt they bought. But in the view of the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, \"It is true that these people paid extra money to buy the salt, but they created the crisis in the first place and caused the price to rise.\" The newspaper continued: \"So there is no reason why they should get the money back.\" Perhaps consumers should keep the salt to remind themselves that often rumors are without foundation.

        "question": "Yesterday I started the Year of Giving, my first day of a year-long journey into exploring the act of giving and the meaning of charity. I chose December 15 as the starting date, which marked three years since my mother died from heart disease. She was one of the most generous people that I have ever known. She always thought of others first and certainly serves as an inspiration to me. I had a rather busy day yesterday, ironic  for someone who is unemployed right now. In the morning I went to the gym, and unsuccessfully got the phone call from the unemployment office for some job searching. Before I knew it, it was noon. I grabbed a quick lunch and rushed down to a meeting. On my way to Connecticut, I wondered if I would see someone that I would feel forced to give my first $10 to. I was running late and decided to do it afterwards. After the meeting I had about half an hour to find the first person of my Year of Giving! I decided to check out Dupont Circle. I had met a guy there named Jerry once and thought he would willingly accept my first $10. He wasn't there, but I did see a man sitting by himself who looked really lonely, so I approached him. Now I had to figure out what I was going to say. I think I said something like, \"Hi, can I sit down here?\" \"I would like to know if I could give you $10?\" He asked me to repeat what I had said. I did, then he looked at me funny, got up and left. I then started walking south where I spotted a man standing by the bus stop on Connecticut Ave. He appeared to be in his 60s. I don't know what drew me to him, but I thought I would make my second attempt. I was a bit nervous and asked him which bus came by that stop. Then I explained that I was starting a year-long project to give $10 to someone every day and that I wanted to give my $10 for today to him. The gentleman, I later found out that his name was Ed, responded without hesitation that he could not accept my offer and that there were many people more deserving the money than him. This was exactly one of the things that I hoped would happen. People would think of others before themselves! In the author's second attempt, the gentleman refused his offer because  _  .",

In the beginning of her story, Kessa is a normal 15-year-old. She is good at many things, especially dancing. She has danced for many years and loves it. One day her dance teacher tells her to continue eating right, but maybe lose a few pounds. Once Kessa hears this, she takes things too far. Instead of cutting down on snacks and junk food, she decides not to eat at all. She does not eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. She begins losing weight and becomes slimmer   and slimmer. But she loses weight to a point where she is unhealthy. As her poor eating habits continue, her parents start getting as much help as possible to cure   their beautiful daughter. But it is just as hard for Kessa's parents to deal with her disorder as it is for her. Everyday she exercises to lose more pounds and plans what and when she will eat. Her parents try everything, but Kessa decides not to have any fat on her body. Kessa's doctor and parents finally take her to the hospital. She is now so thin that she can hardly walk. There, she is given good care. In the rest of the book, Kessa goes through a lot of trouble in order to cure her eating disorder. This book, I think, can help to prevent people from doing this to themselves. It shows the trouble that people go through just to be slimmer, and all the terrible things they must experience to be cured. It is a book I think every teenager should read.

And, it has made the word \"me\" one of the most frequently used words. Everything seems to be about \"me\". This generation has a greater awareness of itself.  Some people do not seem to agree that all this is self-centred. When Cai Fuchao, prefix = st1 /Beijing's publicity head, was asked to comment on the lack of responsibility of university students during the SARS period, his reply was: \"Modern university students are ambitious, knowledgeable and have a very strong sense of responsibility to the society.\"  As news analyst from sina.com, Pan Fengliang, echoed that, saying that blindly blaming them(for running away during the SARS outbreak)was prejudiced and unfair and not backed with evidence.  No doubt, the development of information technology has contributed its bit to broadening, or bending, the minds of the 80s generation.  Some people even call Gen'80 \"the E-generation\".

        "question": "Music is often thought of as \"easy\" or \"play time\", but it's not that at all. Music plays a very important part in our education. Students who learn music learn a lot of music history at school. This includes \"modes  \",which were used in churches during the development of music. They are still used today. Students learn about the historical events that were taking place when the music they play was written. They learn what the music was used for. So much of our culture is in music and has been for centuries.  Music also helps with science. Students use science to help them discover what sounds good together and what doesn't. Students also need science to understand something called the \"overtone series\", which is about how music is produced by vibration   and why. Students learn a lot about languages. Many songs are written in other languages, including ancient ones. Students must learn to translate these works to understand what they are singing about. Some songs are famous poems or short works set to music. Students learn a huge amount of coordination   through music, so parts of the body can work better together. Students must use fine motor skills in order to play an instrument. Singers and players must learn breath control and be in good shape to play. Students learn about art. Some famous pieces were written about important works of art, and students learn about the artists and styles as they're playing the music.  Music education also brings higher thinking to our children. It allows them to think about complex patterns (How can I make my part sound better?How do this music and these different parts fit together?). Students have to know absolutely what every other musician does at all times. In that way, it develops teamwork. As one can see, music is very important to education besides bringing us fun.

Speaking at a briefing on Tuesday,the WHO's Western Pacific regional director, Shin Young--Soo,cited reports about poor air quality causing lung cancer in recent weeks. \"The WHO is skeptical of the information,\"she said.\"We're cautious of whether the illness is related to air po11ution.

The health impact of Beijing's gray skies has been on the minds of many over the past week. Local authorities on Tuesday preserved an orange alert the city's second highest pollution-warning level--and again warned people to stay indoors.Experts widely agree that small particulates  known as PM2.5 carry significant short-and long-term health risks,particularly with children.Other studies find a certain link between pollution and shorter life spans.  Chinese state media have noted a rise in cancer levels in Beijing,without specifying  whether the new cases are the main result of pollution,smoking,other sources or some combination. Bernhard Schwartlander,the organization's China chief,said he is concerned and has been in contact with national authorities.\"There is no easy solution,\"Dr. Schwartlainder said,adding that solving the problem requires managing industry and the economy.WHO leaders advised citizens.to stay indoors and limit exposure to the harmful particulates.When asked if wearing a face mask has any proven efficacy in preventing health effects of air pollution,Dr. Schwartlainder said,\"Whatever you do,it's better than nothing.\" We can learn from the passage that_.",

Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the Earth. On 17 July , a piece four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere   with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the sea bed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards from the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned. Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes are set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero .Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years.

Grandfather's garden was where I took refuge   from a world of adults and schoolwork. My grandfather cultivated squash   and tomatoes -- it was not rare to find me somewhere in the garden, either secretly eating a tomato, or just sitting and admiring my grandfather's hard work. However, as time went by, I did not have the chance to visit his house as often as I used to. On my eleventh birthday, I received a gift bag wrapped in pretty paper from my grandfather. Excited to see what he had given to me for my birthday, I tore apart the paper only to find a yellow squash. I was very angry. What a stupid present! But gradually, I realized that in my developing a relationship with his garden, I had unknowingly grown very close to my grandfather himself, something he wished to remind me of through his gift. His commitment towards doing things definitely influenced me. It could bring him a sense of accomplishment. Because of him, I try to model the idea of approaching everything with both drive and passion. My grandfather passed away five years ago, but his influence on me could not be bigger than it is today. As I prepare to enter college and move on from my relatively sheltered high school life toward achieving complete independence, allowing my passions to find their way into whatever I may be doing will be very necessary. I still look up to my grandfather very much to this day, and I hope that one day I will be able to sow in my own garden, and give someone else a squash on his or her birthday -- it was the most meaningful gift I have ever received.[:ZXXK] Why did the grandfather send the author a squash?",

If it means going back to college for 2 years of night school, could you do it ? If it means reading a book a week for about 6 months in order to really master a new skill ? If you aren't prepared to do any of those things because they are outside of your comfort zone, then you can forget being succesful. I guarantee you will never reach your goals in life, unless your goals are to be ordinary. The biggest killer by far is the dreaded \" comfort zone \" where most people live in their entire life. And the funny thing is that people just can't wrap their heads around the fact that people who have reached some success get tons of time to just relax, but only because they've earned it ! If you haven't built a successful business, or in some way built a career that allow you so much freee time, then you are stuck in the grinding world of nine-to-five jobs everyone else. So how comfortable is that ? So what can you do about it ? Well, find a way to make something happen in your life--- build a business around your favourite hobby, write a book and publish it, or take a course in stock trading and become an expert at that, working on making enough money to retire. If you don't take massive action that puts your way of your comfort zone, you will never be successful at much of anything. I promise--- and I don't make many promises !

Frost entered Dartmouth University in 1893, but dropped out, and switched to Harvard, which he attended for two years. He started a brief teaching career, where he was inspired to become a poet by some of his students' work. Frost stopped teaching and became a farmer. During this time he wrote numerous poems, and a couple of short stories. While he was a farmer he started to think seriously about becoming a famous poet. In almost all of his poems, Frost wrote in the first person. The first widely-read poem that he published was called My Butterfly. At first his audience was very small, but with his Collected Poems he became famous. Robert Frost received almost all the awards that there were for poetry. His poetry describes the forces of nature, and the violence and deep emotional  needs of human beings, which reflect the experiences of his childhood. Robert Frost will always be known as one of the best poets in history. His way of putting emotion and violence into words is remarkable .

        "question": "It was in the Victorian Era   that the novel became the leading form of literature in English. Most writers were more concerned to meet the tastes of the middle class. The best known works of the period included the works of Charles Dickens and the Bronte sisters and others. Charles Dickens came on the literary scene in the 1830s. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and the struggles of the poor. Most of his works were written in a very humorous style, which was popular with readers of all classes. The Bronte sisters were English writers of the 1840s and 1850s. They began to write from early childhood. In 1846 they published the first book at their own expense as poets; however, their book attracted little attention, selling only two copies. Then the sisters turned to writing novels, each producing a novel in the following year. An interest in rural  matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside may be seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy and a number of others. Literature for children developed as a single style. Some works became well-known, such as those of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. Adventure novels were written for adults but are now generally grouped in the list for children. Helen Beatrix Potter was an English author at the end of the Victorian Era, best known for her children's books, which featured (......) animal characters.

It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \"great Alachua Savannah.\" Most of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here. A large number of sandhill cranes, hawks and waterfowl are here in winter. The animal _ is increased by the presence of pine flatwoods, hammock, swamps and ponds. The Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park is open year round. The Florida Park Service works hard so that the park will appear as it did in the past. It offers many opportunities for recreation. At the park you can camp and picnic. You can hike and bike. You can boat and fish. You can ride on horse trails. And you can see lots of nature and wildlife. You can see Florida as it was in the early days. Paynes Prairie is a part of our Florida history. It is an example of our Florida natural resources. It is a place for recreation.

Sure, there are real dangers connected with all this screen time--everything from cyberbullying  to couch-potato obesity.Not to mention driving while texting, and shortened attention spans . Douglas Gentile, who studies the effects of media on children, says texting, Facebook and video games are not naturally bad.Nor are they naturally better or worse than watching TV, although they do lead to different risks, such as cyberbullying. But research has shown that the more time kids spend in front of screens--whether it's TV or instant-messaging--the worse their school performances are.\"That doesn't mean it's true for every kid, but it makes sense, that for every hour a kid is playing video games, it's an hour that they're not doing homework or reading or exploring or creating,\" he said.If screen time is taking the place of doing their homework, that's bad.But if their homework is done, well, so what? The study also found that the more time kids spend with media, the lower their grades and levels of personal satisfaction are.Gentile said the influence of screen time on school work can be reduced by what he calls \"protective factors\".Those might include good teachers and a high-performing school, love of reading, coming from a family where education is valued.\"If you had all these protective factors, then that one little risk factor, who cares?\" One thing parents should worry about is the way electronic devices encourage multitasking . \"As adults, your response speeds up, you're quicker to look over your shoulder and notice little noises or lights.However this is not what the kids need when they get to the classroom.Scanning to see when the next message comes may not be good for kids.The more distractions  you have, the worse your performance is.\" Getting kids to turn off their phones, iPods in order to let them concentrate  on homework is a fight worth having.

        "question": "On November 15th, 2014, children aged 8 to 12 got together in five cities around the world to participate in the first Global Children's Designation. The event that was organized by a Dutch company called Unexpect, challenged kids to come up with solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems in a day! The day began with the kids listening to the various challenges that were related to their particular cities and towns. The teams were then asked to brainstorm about which problem they were going to handle and how. There were so many amazing ideas produced on that day. While some of the ideas were far from perfect, there were many that could be practical like the smart cars which can ease traffic pressure by telling traffic lights of its arrival and also guiding the drivers to the best possible route . Emer Beamer, the founder of Unexpect, says the purpose of the project is to introduce children to skills they probably never learn in class. She says that for most part, schools focus on teaching things that they will most likely never need to know again. She believes that for kids to be successful in the world, they should be learning how to be creative, handle new technologies and deal with unexpected situations. Though the first global design challenge was relatively small, involving only a few hundred of the two billion youngsters that are bursting with ideas, the next one will be much bigger. That's because in 2015, Unexpect plans to distribute free tool kits  to any school that is interested in hosting their own Children's Designation Challenge. We can't wait to see what ideas kids will come up with next. What will Emer plan to do to make the next global design challenge bigger?",

The so-called shopping method has become common practice these days, but that can put your wallet under a lot of pressure. So if you are sad and feel like shopping, don't! According to the recent study, sadness leads to self-focus   thinking. In other words, sad people are willing to spend more money on the same thing than calm people. \"It is the result of sadness and self-focus, and it turns out that sadness leads to an increase in self-focus,\" said Cynthia Cruder. \"What we think is that sad and self-focused people are feeling pretty bad about themselves, and one way to deal with this is buying material goods.\" In a perfect situation, when you know you are sad, you should avoid  making decisions and spending money. Sounds simple? Sadly, it is not. Most people don't even know they're sad, the study shows, and they are not aware that their feelings influence their decisions. What to do? The study showed that those who watched a tragedy  were more likely to spend three times more money for a simple bottle of water than those who watched a comedy.

When it began requiring applicants to take a test known as the SAT in 1935, Harvard started another trend. Two years ago, after it announced an aggressive new financial-aid policy, it helped push social class to the center of the national debate over higher education and forced two of its main competitors, Stanford and Yale, to follow its lead. Last week. Harvard began to make another effort to affect higher education in its image, its president, Derek Bok, announced that the college would abandon its early admissions program, which for decades has allowed high school seniors to apply in October and get an answer yes, no or maybe - in December, shortly before the regular deadline for applications. Harvard officials argue that the program is beneficial to rich students who don't need to compare financial-aid offers from various colleges. After the announcement, many people within education urged other colleges to take a similar step. \"We're thrilled,\" said Laurie Kobick, a college counselor   at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va. \"I think it's going to make admissions better in so many different ways. It will indeed go a small way toward leveling the field among applicants. Of course, it will also have an effect on colleges, and the biggest winner will almost certainly be Harvard. a fact that may prevent many other colleges - perhaps all of them - from       following Hazard this time.

A new study shows that learning to play a musical instrument makes the brain more able to remember words. \"Grown-ups with music training in their childhood can have better memory for words,\" said Dr Agnes Chan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who did the research. \"They can remember things that you tell them better than those who did not have music training when they were young.\" It seems that one can remember spoken words because his brain has a special part. \"That part of the brain is larger in musicians than in non-musicians,\" Dr Chan told BBC. \"If that part of the brain is larger, it may be better developed and so this explains very nicely our results.\" Dr Chan and her workmates came to their conclusion after studying students. Their research is reported in the latest edition of the journal  Nature. \"We did the experiment with 60 girl college students from our university and 30 of them have at least six years training with one western musical instrument (such as the violin and the piano) before the age of 12. The other 30 had received no music training. We tested their memory by reading them some words and asking them to remember these words--a very common test for memory. We found that people who have had music training can remember about 70% more information than those who have not had any music training.\" Dr Chan thinks the process  of learning is more important than the actual instrument used. She also believes if one is able to remember words through learning to play instruments, he or she could have some very real benefits. Dr Chan thinks this could be developed into a medical way for patients who are suffering from memory loss. How many students took part in Dr Chan's research?",

In his first novel, A Wind In Montana, Mitch Davies tells a story about young adults and how they accept responsibility for their lives. A Wind in Montana is a great tale of two teenagers, Rory Coleman and Victoria Beach, high school students at the same school, who struggle to make the right decision for themselves. As each of them nears adulthood, they become more concerned with the future and set goals that will bring them happiness and a sense of achievement. Without any advice from his parents, Rory chooses to pursue   a profession in chemistry, applies for a chemistry scholarship, and determines to do everything he can to achieve it. Along the path, Rory finds that even though he has a plan, there are obstacles   that could prevent him from realizing his goals. Victoria's struggles are different from Rory's. Although her father has decided that she should become a professional musician, Victoria has other plans for her life. Together, Rory and Victoria attempt to follow their dreams, despite the obstacles in their paths. A Wind In Montana contains a lesson for all teens about to enter adulthood -- that disappointment and setbacks   are going to occur no matter how determined they are and that they need to develop skills along the way that will help them deal with them effectively. Mitch Davies' book stands out among today's teen books that deal with imaginary situations. A Wind In Montana is a real story about real people facing real-life situations.

Jeb put his bag down quickly and pulled his jacket open with both hands, making himself look big to the cougar. It worked. The cougar hesitated, ready to attack Jeb, but ready to forget the whole thing, too. Jeb let go of his jacket, grasped Tom and held him across his body, making a cross. Now the cougar's enemy looked even bigger, and it rose up, ready to move away, but unfortunately Tom got scared and struggled free of Jeb. \"Tom, no!\" shouted his father. But Tom broke and ran and that's the last thing you do with a cougar. The second Tom broke free, Jeb threw himself on the cougar, just as it jumped from the rock. They hit each other in mid-air and both fell. The cougar was on Jeb in a flash, forgetting about Tom, which was what Jeb wanted. Cougars are not as big as most people think and a determined man stands a chance, even with just his fists. As the cougar's claws got into his left shoulder, Jeb swung his fist at its eyes and hit hard. The animal howled and put its head back. Jeb followed up with his other fist. Then out of the corner of his eye, Jeb saw Tom. The boy was running back to help his father. \"Knife, Tom\" shouted Jeb. The boy ran to his father's bag, while Jeb stated shouting as well as hitting, to keep the cougar's attention away from Tom. Tom got the knife and ran over to Jeb. The cougar was moving its head in and out, trying to find a way through the wall Jeb was making out of his arms. Tom swung with the knife, into the cougar's back. It howled horribly and ran off into the mountains. The whole fight had taken about thirty seconds. How did Jeb try to hold the cougar's attention?",

While the elephant population is half of what it was 40 years ago, some areas of Africa have more elephants than populated areas can support. That's why AWF scientists are studying elephant behavior, protecting habitats and finding ways for humans to live peacefully with elephants in Africa. Years ago, over hunting and the ivory trade were the biggest threats to elephants survival. Luckily, ivory bans  , hunting rules and protected areas protect elephants from these dangers today. The 21st century brings a different challenge to elephant conservation --land-use. Elephants walk across borders and outside parks and other protected areas. So they often destroy crops, causing conflicts   between local farmers and these big animals. Successful conservation strategies   must allow elephants to walk freely in their natural habitats while reducing conflicts between elephants and local people. AWF researchers are searching for a way to give both elephants and people the space they need. The AWF is collecting information on elephant habitats and behavior. The information they gather will help to develop the widest possible space for elephants. The AWF is helping elephants by protecting their habitats.

Then another robot on wheels delivered the cup of tea in an experimental room that has sensors _ in the floor and sofa as well as cameras on the ceiling, to simulate life with robot technology. \"A human being may be faster, but you'd have to say 'Thank you,'\" said University of Tokyo professor Tomomasa Sato. \"That's the best part about a robot. You don't have to feel bad about asking it to do things.\" Sato believes Japan, a rapidly aging society where more than a fifth of the population is 65 or older, will lead the world in designing robots to care for the elderly, sick and bedridden . Already, monitoring technologies, such as sensors that automatically turn on lights when people enter a room, are becoming widespread in Japan. The walking, child-size Asimo from Honda Motor Co. greets people at showrooms. NEC Corp. has developed a smaller companion robot-on -wheels called Papero. A seal robot available since 2004 can entertain the elderly and others in need of fuzzy companionship. Sato says his experimental room is raising awareness about privacy questions that may arise when electronic devices monitor a person's movements down to the smallest detail. On the bright side, the tea - pouring humanoid has been programmed to do the dishes. Which of the following statements is NOT true?",

        "question": "As a result of pollution, Lake Erie, on the borders of the USA and Canada, is now without many living things. Pollution in water is not simply a matter of \"poisons\" killing large numbers of fish overnight. Very often the effects of pollution are not noticed for many months or years because the first organisms   to be affected are either plants or plankton  . These organisms are the food of fish, birds, and other creatures. When this food disappears, the fish and birds die too. In this way a whole food chain can be wiped out, and it is not until dead fish and water birds are seen at the river's edge or on the sea shore that people realize what is happening. Where do the substances which pollute water come from? There are two main sources, sewage  and industrial waste. As more detergent  is used in homes, more of it is finally put into our rivers, lakes and seas.  Detergents harm water birds by breaking down the natural substances which keep their feathers _ Sewage itself, if not properly treated, makes the water dirty and prevents all forms of life in rivers and the sea from receiving the oxygen they need. Industrial waste is even more harmful since there are many highly poisonous materials in it, such as copper and lead. So if we want to stop this pollution, the answer is simple. Sewage and industrial waste must be made clean before flowing into the water reservoirs. It may already be too late to save some rivers and lakes, but others can still be saved if the correct action is taken at once. Pollution in water is noticed   _  .",

But Amy said they didn't need to. When Mr. Dawson saw Amy, he smiled and said: \" Hello, Amy! I see you have a new friend with you today.\" Amy smiled back. Mr. Dawson was friendly and gave them each a fresh apple. Later, Janet asked Amy: \" Everyone says he is the most unwelcoming  person in town. Why was he kind to us?\" Amy explained that when she first walked past his house, she was also afraid of him. But she pretended  there was an invisible  smile on his face and started talking to him. At first she only said \"hello\" but then began talking to him more every time she saw him. \"An invisible smile?\" Janet was puzzled  . \"Yes,\" answered Amy. \"My grandma told me to try that.

There are many ways to learn English. You can learn from a book, a DVD, on the Internet or by attending classes. One of the most successful ways to improve your English is to join a course in a country where English is widely spoken. The more you practice, the more you will learn. But why learn the English language? English is an important language for anyone who is planning to travel or become involved in business. Many people love travelling, but if their English is poor, it can be difficult to understand signs, read directions and make themselves understood. Before travelling, it is important to understand the culture and customs of the places you visit. Learning basic English before you travel will help you to understand these customs and avoid mistakes that could be embarrassing. When you are travelling, you will also enjoy meeting new people. If you can speak English, you will have a better chance of being able to communicate with the people you meet. Many of your new friends will speak English and others will have English as a second language. Without English, your friendships will be limited as you travel around the world. If you are involved in business, it is important to be able to communicate in English. The Internet, world travel and modern communication systems have made the world seem like a much smaller place. These days business people interact with customers and other business people from all over the world. That makes your English language skills more important than ever. There are many English language courses that major in business communications. Improving your English skills is one of the best things you could ever do to increase your chances of business success.

When his foot was well enough, he rode out a great deal,and all my knowledge of him was limited to occasional meetings about the house, when he would sometimes pass me coldly, and sometimes bow and smile. His changes of manner did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with the cause of them. One evening, several days later, I was invited to talk to Mr. Rochester after dinner. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes were bright, probably with wine. As I was looking at him, he suddenly turned, and asked me, \"Do you think I'm handsome, Miss Eyre?\" The answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I realized it: \"No, sir.\" \"Ah, you really are unusual! You are a quiet, serious little person, but you can be almost rude.\" \"Sir, I'm sorry. I should have said that beauty doesn't matter, or something like that.\" \"No, you shouldn't! I see, you criticize my appearance, and then you stab  me in the back! You have honesty and feeling. There are not many girls like you.\" I thought to myself that he might have too.

Because you're the sort of person people tell their problems and secrets to, and because you're sympathetic and give them hope.\" It seemed he had quite a lot to talk to me. He didn't seem to like to finish the talk quickly, as was the case for the first time. \"Don't be afraid of me, Miss Eyre.\" He continued, \"you don't relax or laugh very much, perhaps because of the effect Lowood school has had on you.  But in time you will be more natural with me, and laugh, and speak freely. You're like a bird in a cage.

        "question": "The entertainment profession or \"show business\" attracts many young people. Unfortunately, only very few can hope to become famous and successful. Talent is not enough, because show business is as competitive as any other business .Without a good manager ,a performer can never hope to succeed .Fashion is important in this business, too. The best tailor in the world will never be a success if he makes old-fashioned clothes. In exactly the same way, a performer must change his \"act\" in order to follow the taste of the moment. This is true for actors, dancers and comedians, but perhaps most of all singers. \"Pop\" stands for \"popular\" and a pop singer has to work very hard to become popular .He must either give the public what they already want, or he must find a new way of singing that will attract their attention. Even when he has succeeded, and his records are sold everywhere, he can not relax. Then he must work harder than ever because there are always younger singers trying to become famous and to steal some of the popularity.The life of a successful pop singer is not at all easy. He can only relax when he is alone, because everything he does is watched and reported in the special newspaper written for the \"fans\". The fans are the most important people in the world for the singers. They buy his records, they go to his concerts and they make him rich and famous. But they can be very annoying, too. Sometimes their enthusiasm get so hysterical that they do anything to get a \"souvenir\" . They steal handkerchiefs, they tear off buttons, and they even cut off pieces of the unfortunate singer's hair. Many singers have been forced to hide. A pop singer has to spend a lot of money on clothes, because he must always look smart or at any rate different. He must have a luxurious car. And -- most important -- he must always keep smiling for the benefit of his public. For a pop singer , the most important advantage of having fans is that  _  .",

        "question": "There are many older people in the world and there will be many more.A limeknown fact is that over 60 percent of the older people live in developing countries.According to the World Health Organization,by 2020 there will be 1 billion,with over 700 million living in developing countries. It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value  the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are  respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change. Much needs to be done to get rid of age discrimination   in employment.Lifelong learning programs need to be provided to enable older people to be active members in a country's development. Social security policies need to be established to provide adequate income protection for older people.Both public and private schemes are vital in order to build a suitable safety net. To achieve equality in such matters will take considerable time and effort.One thing is sure:there is no time to be lost.

We decided to stop at a local gas station to get coffee and something to snack on since it was a good hour and a half before we got home. When we were done, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a man standing outside in front of the building. He was a homeless man with worn clothes and it looked like he had gone in and gotten himself some coffee or something warm to drink since it was cold this time of the year. He must have not had enough money to get something to eat. Then a dog walked up to the front of the building. I could tell she was a \"she\", because you could tell that she had baby dogs. She was terribly in need of something to eat and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her baby dogs would not make it. I and my wife sat there and looked at her. We noticed that people walked by and didn't even pet her, like most people do when they walk by an animal in front of a store. We still did not do anything. But the homeless man, who I thought did not buy himself anything to eat, went back into the store. And what he did brought tears to me and my wife. He had gone into the store and with what money he may have had, bought a can of dog food and fed that dog. This story plays a great part in our lives. You see, that was Mother's Day weekend.

        "question": "Fish have ears. Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate  . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements   of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. If the passage goes on, it possibly refers to   _  .",

Some studies suggest it can help protect against cancer. Thanks to the health food craze, green tea sales are currently rising sharply. The Tea Association of the USA reports that green tea sales jumped more than 60 percent in the last decade. And in Canada, government data shows that profits for green tea imports more than quadrupled  . Nowadays, green tea seems to be everywhere. In shops, you can buy green tea leaves prepared in a number of ways: fried, powdered or steamed. Despite green tea's healthy reputation, the drink was once considered dangerous. Where did this silly opinion come from? Blame the Victorians, of course, who lived in a period of English history in the 19th century. That's when some of the silliest theories about green tea arose. One 1882 book described strange experiments to show the harm of green tea. Apply some green tea below a frog's stomach, and you could cause paralysis   in its legs, the book claimed. And injecting green tea into a dog would cause it to lose control of its legs and tail. The book went so far as to declare that green tea could kill someone. At that time, a green tea panic was sweeping England. Even Charlotte Bronte, a famous English writer, refused to touch the drink, fearing its terrible effects it would have on her nerves. Some of the fear was well reasonable, though. English consumers preferred brighter leaves, over dull olive- color1ed ones. As a result, tea sellers would dye   their products, using anything including poisons like \"Prussian blue\". Even today, mixing green tea with chemicals remains a problem. But those rare instances aren't stopping Westerners from raising their pinky fingers in salute  to green tea and all its nutritional advantages. Bottoms up! What's the best title for the passage?",

        "question": "56yearold becomes 1st woman to swim Atlantic (AP)-Jennifer Figge pressed her toes into the Caribbean sand, excited and exhausted as she touched land this week for the first time in almost a month. Reaching a beach in Trinidad, she became the first woman on record to swim across the Atlantic Ocean--a dream she'd had since the early 1960s,when a stormy transAtlantic   flight got her thinking she could wear a life vest and swim the rest of the way if needed. The 56yearold left the Cape Verde Islands off Africa's western coast on Jan.12,2009, swimming 19 out of 25 days battling waves of up to 30 feet.The distance from Cape Verde to Trinidad is about 700 miles.Crewmembers are still computing exactly how many miles she swam. The original plan was for her to swim to the Bahamas--a distance of about 2,100 miles--but inclement   weather forced her to change her plans and she arrived at Trinidad on Feb.5.She now plans to swim from Trinidad to the British Virgin Islands,ending her voyage at the Bitter End Yacht Club in late February. Her journey came a decade after French swimmer Benoit Lecomte made the first known solo transAtlantic swim,covering nearly 4,000 miles from Massachusetts to France in 73 days.No woman on record had made the crossing. Figge wore a red cap and wet suit,with her only goodluck charm   underneath:an old,red shirt to guard against chafing  ,signed by friends,relatives and her father,who recently died.The other cherished   possession she kept onboard was a picture of Gertrude Ederle,an American who became the first woman to swim across the English Channel.\"We have a few things in common,\"Figge said,\"She wore a red hat and she was of German descent  .We both talked to the sea,and neither one of us wanted to get out.\" When did Benoit Lecomte probably make the first known solo transAtlantic swim?",

        "question": "Time for Kids (TFK) gets the great news on the coolest toys for 2014 at the 111th American International Toy Fair. What's four days long, bigger than seven football fields, and filled with thousands of toys? It's Toy Fair 2014! Each year, hundreds of toy companies from across the country come together in New York City. All kinds of products are shown as a way to know what's to come in the new year. This year's trends   include oversize toys. \"In 2014, everything is really big and really out there,\" says Adrienne Appell, a toy-trends expert. Toy Fair is the largest toy trade show in the Western Hemisphere  . Toy-store buyers go to the event to decide which toys they may want to sell during the holiday season. Members of the media, like TFK, go to the fair to report back on all the cool trends. Unfortunately, Toy Fair is not open to the public. This year's Toy Fair was the biggest in its 111-year history. More than 1,000 toy companies showed products from simple card games to high-tech robots. \"Larger Than Life\" was a Toy Fair favorite. This trend is all about big toys with a big play value. Though it is all fun and games at Toy Fair, we saw lots of products making a push towards education, with STEAM. That stands for science, technology, engineering, art, and math. This trend includes word games. And of course, we saw some super cool, high-tech games. \"Technology is always going to influence toys,\" says Appell. \"This year we saw lots of 3D games, and robots.\"[:ZXXK] To know more information about the event, click   here to watch the video.
