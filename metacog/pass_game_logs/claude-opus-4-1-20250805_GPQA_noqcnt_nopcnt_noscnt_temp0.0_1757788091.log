Game Setup Prompt: 
        Let's play a game. I'm going to ask you 443 questions. Each question is multiple choice. 
        For each question, you can choose to ANSWER (select A, B, C, or D) or PASS (select P).
        If you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point; if you pass, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.

Question:
"1,2-Rearrangement reaction in which vicinal diols are allowed to react with acid is called Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reaction. This reaction proceeds through the formation of carbocation that cause the shifting of one of the groups.
For the compounds given below which are the possible products of the Pinacol rearrangement?
3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol + H+ ---> A
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol + H+ ---> B
1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol + H+ ---> C
----------
  A: A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one
  B: A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one
  C: A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one
  D: A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one
