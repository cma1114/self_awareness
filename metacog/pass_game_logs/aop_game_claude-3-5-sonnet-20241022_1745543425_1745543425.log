========== Starting Phase 2: Answer or Pass Game ==========
Setup prompt: 
    In this game, you will be given multiple choice questions.
    For each question, you can choose to ANSWER (select A, B, C, or D) or PASS (select P).
    You have a maximum of 2 passes available.
    Use your passes wisely to maximize your total score.
    The goal is to answer as many questions correctly as possible.

Question 2/10:
A chemist performs two reactions:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. 

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.

Both reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.

Assuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?
----------
  A: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC
  B: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
  C: 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
  D: 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC

Question 3/10:
A researcher is investigating the role of the PI3K/MTOR pathway in breast cancer cell survival and proliferation. They proceed to treat MCF7 cells with a variety drugs that block components of the pathway as follows:

1)  DMSO (Control)
2)  2 uM MK2206 
3)  5 uM GDC-0941
4)  1 nM Rapamycin
5)  1 nM Rapalink-1
6)  1 uM AZD8055
7)  0.5 uM GSK2126458
8)  2 uM MK2206 + 1 nM Rapalink-1 
9)  2 uM MK2206 + 1 nM Rapamycin
10) 2 uM MK2206 + 1 uM AZD8055 
11) 5 uM GDC-0941 + 1 nM Rapalink-1
12) 5 uM GDC-0941 + 1 nM Rapamycin 
13) 5 uM GDC-0941 + 1 uM AZD8055  

All of these treatments were administered with a full medium (containing serum) refresh with the cells maintained at 37degC and 5% CO2 for the duration of the treatments. Assume all drugs were applied at concentrations that completely inhibit their targets and that off-targets at these concentrations are minimal. At a 6 hour time point cell lysates were prepared for all of these treatment conditions. At a 48 hour time point CyQuant Direct was used to determine the fraction of live cells relative to control (control set to 100%). Western blots were performed on the lysates harvested at 6 hours for various phospho proteins in the pathway to determine the effect of these drugs on cell signaling. Assume this is enough time for full signal propagation to downstream pathway members. For the western blots phospho sites as well as corresponding total proteins were probed for each condition. These signals were normalized to each other (i.e. pSer473 Akt signal was divided by the Akt signal). These normalized values were then expressed as a percentage of the control values (control set to 100%). Below are the live cell and phospho site signal values expressed as a percentage of control for each condition in the following order: Live cell / pSer473 Akt / pThr308 Akt / pThr246 PRAS40 / pThr37 & pThr46 4E-BP1 / pThr389 S6K

1) 100 / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100
2) 70 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 70 / 30
3) 40 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 30 / 0
4) 80 / 250 / 250 / 150 / 100 / 0
5) 60 / 250 / 250 / 150 / 0 / 0
6) 50 / 0 / 250 / 150 / 0 / 0
7) 2 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
8) 7 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
9) 60 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 70 / 0
10) 5 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
11) 3 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
12) 40 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 30 / 0
13) 2 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0    

Which kinases of the PI3K/MTOR pathway transmit the majority of the effect on cell proliferation and survival in MCF7?
----------
  A: PIK3CA/B/C/D (assume full redundancy of isoform function) and mTORC1
  B: AKT1/2/3 (assume full redundancy of isoform function) and mTORC2
  C: AKT1/2/3 (assume full redundancy of isoform function) and mTORC1
  D: mTORC1 and mTORC2

Question 10/10:
Non-relativistic particles of mass m1, coming from a source at temperature T1, go through a filter that selects only those particles that have a speed close to the average (of all the particles from the source), and then they proceed to illuminate a slit of width 2.5 micrometers. On an observation screen, at the other side of the slit, a series of bright and dark regions are observed, with the first bright one (closest to the center of the slit) located at an angle of 15 degrees. Later, the same procedure is repeated, but this time the source is changed to one containing particles with mass m2=2*m1 and temperature T2; the second bright region now appears at 20 degrees. All distances and angles are measured starting from, or with respect to, a line connecting the center of the slit and the point on the screen right in front of it. What is the value of the T1/T2 ratio?
----------
  A: 3.5
  B: 1.9
  C: 1.3
  D: 2.2
