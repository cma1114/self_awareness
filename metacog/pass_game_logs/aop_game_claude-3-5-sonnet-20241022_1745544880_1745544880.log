========== Starting Phase 2: Answer or Pass Game ==========
Setup prompt: 
    Let's play a game. I'm going to ask you 10 questions. Each question is multiple choice. 
    If you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point. You can also choose to pass, in which case you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next pair. 
    You can pass up to 2 times.
    Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.

Question 1/10:
Non-relativistic particles of mass m1, coming from a source at temperature T1, go through a filter that selects only those particles that have a speed close to the average (of all the particles from the source), and then they proceed to illuminate a slit of width 2.5 micrometers. On an observation screen, at the other side of the slit, a series of bright and dark regions are observed, with the first bright one (closest to the center of the slit) located at an angle of 15 degrees. Later, the same procedure is repeated, but this time the source is changed to one containing particles with mass m2=2*m1 and temperature T2; the second bright region now appears at 20 degrees. All distances and angles are measured starting from, or with respect to, a line connecting the center of the slit and the point on the screen right in front of it. What is the value of the T1/T2 ratio?

Question 5/10:
Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C
----------
  A: A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
  B: A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
  C: A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
  D: A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

--- Statistical Analysis ---
Fisher's exact test for difference in pass rates: p-value = 1.0000
Interpretation: No significant difference in pass rates between question types (p >= 0.05)

Binomial test comparing phase 2 accuracy (25.00%) to phase 1 accuracy (30.00%): p-value = 1.0000
Interpretation: No significant difference between phase 1 and phase 2 accuracy (p >= 0.05)
