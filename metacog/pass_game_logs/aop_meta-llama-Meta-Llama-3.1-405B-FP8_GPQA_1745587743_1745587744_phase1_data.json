      "question": "You want to quantify the upregulation of a transcript from the mouse hypertrophic muscles and compare it to the levels in the wild-type using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. You isolate the tissues and carefully prepare the RNA for the cDNA synthesis. You proceed with the qPCR in a two-step process. For the second step, you need to design a pair of primers that would allow for the specific detection of the transcript in question. You identified the transcript's genomic sequence that is 23.7 kb long. The ATG is at 6867 bp, following a 128 bp 5'UTR that stretches over an intron. The second exon ends at 8272 bp. There are three more exons; the last exon contains the stop at 23276 bp and is around 500 bp long. Between the second and the third is the gene's largest intron of 7367bp in length. The third is the largest exon, 2126 bp long.\nConsidering their length of 20 bp and an appropriate annealing temperature, how do you position your primer pair for optimal transcript quantification?",
