========== Starting Phase 2: Answer or Pass Game ==========
Setup prompt: 
    Let's play a game. I'm going to ask you 100 questions. Each question is multiple choice. 
    If you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point. You can also choose to pass, in which case you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next pair. 
    You can pass up to 50 times.
    Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.

Question 1/100:
Consider a uniformly charged metallic ring of radius R and total charge q. The ring is a hollow toroid of thickness 2a\ll R. The ùë• ùë¶ plane coincides with the plane of the ring, while the ùëß-axis is perpendicular to it. The electrostatic potential \Phi(z) along the axis of the ring at a ùëß distance from its center is \Phi(z)=\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}} . Calculate the electrostatic potential Œ¶(ùëß) to the lowest non-zero power of ùëß, assuming z\ll R. Taylor expansion formula is,
(1+x)^{\varepsilon}\approx1+\varepsilon x+\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon(\varepsilon-1)x^{2},when|x|\ll1.

  A: \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left(1-\frac{z^{2}}{2R^{3}}\right)

Question 90/100:
Which of the following stars rotates the fastest when considering the velocities at the equator?

Star1 - In the optical spectrum of this star, the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 √Ö exhibits a broadening of 0.1 √Ö due to rotation. The star has a radius twice that of the Sun and a mass 1.1 times that of the Sun. Please ignore the inclination.

Star2 - This star has a rotational period of 20 days, a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun, and a mass 1.2 times that of the Sun. We assume there is no differential rotation.

Star3 - Doppler spectroscopy revealed a projected rotational velocity of about 3.1 km/s for this star. Asteroseismic measurements indicated that the star's rotational axis is inclined by 30 degrees.

Star4 - Radial Velocity time series observations unveiled a 9-day signal with an amplitude of 1.5 m/s. Other activity indicators also exhibited periodic variations with the same period. This signal cannot be attributed to the presence of a planet but is instead due to rotational modulation. The star has a mass of 1 solar mass and a radius of 1.4 solar radii.
