      "question": "The Chinese word \"Shanzhai\" literally means a small mountain village, but it's now used to describe products that have names similar to famous ones. It became an accepted name for fake goods   after \"Shanzhai Cellphones\" produced by small workshops in southern China became popular in the mainland market over the past two years. Besides \"Shanzhai\" electronic products, there are \"Shanzhai\" movies, \"Shanzhai\" stars and even a \"Shanzhai\" Spring Festival Gala , a copy of the 25-year-old traditional show presented by CCTV on Chinese Lunar New Year's Eve.  \"Shanzhai\" has become a culture of its own, standing foranything that _ something famous,which has caused a public debate over whether it is healthy or sick being a copycat. In southwestern China's Chongqing, a \"Shanzhai\"-version \"Bird's Nest\" built by farmers with bamboo attracts wide attention and the \"Shanzhai\"-version \"Water Cube\" is popular with tourists. Both are copies of the famous Olympics places in Beijing.  Xie Xizhang, a literature critic, said that taking the \"Shanzhai\" Gala as an example, when the traditional CCTV program becomes less and less attractive to the audience, the \"Shanzhai\" version appears naturally to attract people.  \"In spite of its poor techniques and operation, 'Shanzhai' culture meets the demands of common people and could be a comfort to their minds,\" Xie said.   Tian Huiqun, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said that \"Shanzhai\" culture never copies classic things, only products in fashion. In that sense, it's like a computer virus without meaning.  Though controversial, \"Shanzhai\" culture is a challenge as well as a motivation, said Xie, according to the newspaper.   Tian said different kinds of cultures developing together are an ideal situation and they are for the public to choose. The underline words \"imitates \" is closest in meaning to   _  .",

      "question": "I used to watch her from my kitchen window. She seemed so small as she muscled her way through the crowd of boys on the playground. The school was across the street from our home and I would often watch the kids as they played during break. I remember the first day I saw her playing basketball. I watched in wonder as she ran circles around the other kids. She managed to shoot jump shots just over their heads and into the net. The boys always tried to stop her but no one could. I began to notice her at other times, basketball in hand, playing alone. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. Without a moment of hesitation she said, \"I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship. I am going to play college basketball. I want to be the best. My Daddy told me if the dream is big enough, the facts don't count.\" Well, I had to give it to her--she was determined. I watched her through those junior high years and into high school. Every week, she led her school team to victory. One day in her senior year, I saw her sitting in the grass, head in her arms. I walked across the street and sat down in the cool grass beside her. Quietly I asked what was wrong. \"Oh, nothing,\" came a soft reply, \"I am just too short.\" The coach told her that at 5'5\" she would probably never get to play for a top ranked team--much less offered a scholarship--so she should stop dreaming about college. She was heartbroken and I felt my own throat tighten as I sensed her disappointment. I asked her if she had talked to her dad about it yet. She told me that her father said those coaches were wrong. They just did not understand the power of a dream. He told her that if she truly wanted a scholarship and that nothing could stop her except one thing -- her own attitude. The next year, as she and her team went to the Northern California Championship game, she was offered a scholarship and on the college team. She was going to get the college education that she had dreamed of. Which proverb best matches the story?",

      "question": "Almost every child is scared of something, from monsters in the cupboard to dogs in the park. But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias  much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological  . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\"scaredy cat\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'.\" If we fail to help children to overcome fears, they will  _  .",

      "question": "Imagine this: you get up in the morning and put on a custom printed T-shirt. Then you eat some 3-D printed food and relax on your printed sofa. Perhaps you take a ride in a printed electric car to the hospital to get a printed tooth fitted. Though some of these things may seem impossible, they're closer to reality than you might think. The world of 3-D printing is coming to a store near you soon. The idea of 3-D printing is to produce complicated shapes in a very personalized way. If you want to make a totally new object, you need to make a virtual design in a CAD(computer aided design)file first. Or you can use a 3-D scanner to make a digital copy of an object. Then, based on the design or copy, the 3-D printer makes paper-thin slices out of liquid, plastic, or metal and puts them together to create the object you want. There are many areas in which 3-D printing can change our lives. One such area is health care. Researchers have developed simple 3-D printed organs, which can be used in life-saving operations. A 17-year-old boy in the US has also recently developed a brain-powered, 3-D printed replacement hand. From heart monitors to fake limbs , we can soon be living longer thanks to 3-D printed technology. Another area that 3-D technology looks sure to change is food. Can you imagine being able to print your favorite dishes at home at the touch of a button? Even big companies are behind the trend. Hersheys, one of the largest chocolate makers in the world, recently announced that it would start producing chocolate with the help of 3-D printers. NASA, the US space agency, has reportedly spent $125,000 (767,594 yuan) developing a \"3-D pizza printer\". It is not yet clear how long it will take until 3-D printers are available to everyone.

      "question": "Peer pressure is all about being forced into a certain way of living,dressing, talking,socializing and even thinking--simply because that is how everyone else you know behaves,dresses,talks,socializes and thinks.     Young people can be often insensitive in their dealings with each other.And they are very quick to notice differences of habit,dress and social behavior.As a result,you might have to buy the latest fashions in clothes and other things.Because everyone else does the same,regardless of cost or comfort.You might end up reading what they read,watching the same television programs and movies that others watch and using the same language that they use.Because,otherwise,you feel left out of all the conversation.You might end up staying out late at night or eating out all the time,simply because that is what the others do,regardless of whether you can afford to or not.     The best way to deal with peer pressure is to select your friends very carefully.Preferably, your friends should be in a mixed group of people.That keeps everyone rooted and more tolerant of differences.

      "question": "The OM Man and the Sea ,for which Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, is one of the most influential novels of the literary treasure of the world. Famously known for his brief and short sentences ,Hemingway created ah interesting and unique style of writing that still appeal to readers today. Santiago was an aged Cuban fisherman, and many thought that he could no longer fish. For eighty-four days ,he set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So unlucky was he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice   and friend , Manolin , forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more profitable boat On the eighty-fifth day ,the fisherman set out into the open sea to go fishing. At noon ,a big Marlin took hold of one of the lines, but the fish was far too big for him to handle. Santiago let the fish have enough line, so that it wouIdn9t break his pole; but he and his boat were dragged out to sea for three days. Finally ,the fish grew tired. Santiago killed it Even this final victory didn't end his journey. He was still far, far out to sea. To make matters worse, Santiago dragged the Marlin behind the boat and the fish blood attracted sharks. Santiago did his best to beat the sharks away ,but his efforts were not enough, The sharks ate the flesh off the Marlin ,and Santiago was left with only the bones. Santiago was tired out He got back home with nothing to show for his pains but the skeletal  remains of a large Marlin. Even with just the bare remains of the fish, the experience changed him, and charged the opinions others had of him. Manolin , who had been worried over the old man's absence, was moved to tears when he found Santiago safe in his bed, When the old man woke ,the two agreed to fish as partners once more. With Santiago5S struggle to catch the Marlin and his journey home ,Santiago's courage was obvious as he faced challenges that just didn't seem to end. He didn't give up and even though he felt he had been very unlucky, there was hope to keep going on. He was destroyed but not defeated. Through the story, Hemingway wants to show us that  _  .",

      "question": "You have the ability to decide if you are happy or not. Happiness is a choice. You can't depend on someone else to make you happy. That is a lesson I learned early on in my marriage. I realized that I couldn't rely on my husband as my source of happiness. I learned that my happiness depended on me and not my husband's actions. I learned that you have to choose to be happy. You can choose your emotions. True happiness comes from within; it can't be forced by outside forces. So how do you choose happiness? The same way you choose to smile or choose to wear a certain outfit. You choose it because that's what you want to experience in your life. You want to buy a new pair of shoes so you choose a pair that you like and feel good. You wouldn't buy a pair of shoes that you don't like or that don't fit well, right? So why do we keep choosing emotions and feelings that don't make us feel good? Choosing to be happy after you realize your anger has shown up (or even choosing to be calm) can be beneficial. We choose our feelings; no one can do that for us. If we let others get to us, influence our emotions - we are giving them power over us. When others cause us anger or pain, we are giving them our power. We need to keep our feelings in check and not react automatically to what is thrown at us. We need to think our actions out instead of just reacting to what someone says or does. Remember that we can always choose happiness. At first it will be difficult to just switch your thoughts and feelings from anger, self-doubt, or fear to joy and happiness. But it is only a thought away. Don't dwell on what happens to you unnecessarily but realize what is causing you to feel that way. Realize that thoughts, feelings and emotions can change. Then move on and choose to be happy.

      "question": "Life on earth depends on water, and there is no substitute for it. The current assumption is that our basic needs for water--whether for drinking, agriculture, industry or the raising of fish--will always have to be met. Given this premise  , there are two basic routes we can go; more equal access to water or better engineering solutions. Look at the engineering solutions first. A lot of my research concentrates on what happens to wetlands when you build dams in river basins, particularly in Africa. The ecology of such areas is almost entirely driven by the seasonal changes of the river--the pulse of the water. And the fact is that if you build a dam, you generally spoil the downstream ecology. In the past, such problems have been hidden by a lack of information. But in the near future, governments will have no excuses for their ignorance. The engineers' ability to control water flows has created new kinds of unpredictability, too. Dams in Africa have meant fewer fish, less grazing and less floodplain   agriculture, none of which were expected. And there average economic life is assumed to be thirty years. Dams don't exist forever, but what will replace them is not clear. The challenge for the future is to find new means of controlling water. Although GM technology  will allow us to breed better dry-land crops, there is no market for companies to develop crops suitable for the micro-climates of the Sahel and elsewhere in Africa. Who is going to pay for research on locally appropriate crops in the Third World? The author suggests that governments will have no excuse for their careless ignorance in the future because   _  .",

Before you give your answer, you should probably know that a new study found that women are better than men at multitasking  , especially if one of those tasks is searching for a lost item. That should help you choose.   In the study, a team of UK researchers compared the performances of 120women and 120men in  a computer game involving tasks of counting and shape-recognition  Men and women were equally capable when tasks were  handled one at a time. But when the tasks started switching quickly , men responded c) much slower than women. To make the experiment more  relevant to everyday life, researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were asked to complete a series of \"everyday challenges\" such as finding restaurants on a map and searching for a lost key in a field. Once again, women outperformed men on the test, particularly in the key-searching task. \"It suggests that- in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them,'' researcher Keith Law of the University of Hertfordshire, UK, told the BBC,[ln contrast,] men had a slight impulsiveness ;they jumped in too quickly\" But where did women get the ability to keep organized under pressure? Researchers believe that it has its roots in evolution ,In early human communities, women had to keep an eye on children while cooking meals. Meanwhile, men only needed to focus on hunting. Men might not be happy about this study. After all, many great pilots are men and they have to deal with lots of information at the same time too. This is true, and researchers have their response. \"[We don't mean]that all men can't multitask, or that only women can,\" said Laws.[We are saying that] the average woman is better able to organize her time and switch  between tasks than the average man.

      "question": "In a few years,you might be able to speak Chinese,Korean,Japanese,French,and English-and all at the same time. This sounds incredible,but Alex Waibel,a computer science professor at US's Car-negie Mellon University (CMU) and Germany's University of Karlsruhe,announced last week that it may soon be reality. He and his team have invented software and hardware that could make it far easier for people who speak different languages to understand each other. One application,called Lecture Translation,can easily translate a speech from one language into an-other. Current translation technologies typically limit speakers to certain topics or a limited vocabulary. Us-ers also have to be trained how to use the programme. Another machine can send translations of a speech to different listeners depending on what languagethey speak. \"It is like having a s _ translator right next to you but without disturbing the person next to you,\"Waibel said Prefer to read? So- called Translation Glasses transcribe  the translations on a tiny liquid-crystal display(LCD) screen. Then there's the Muscle Translator. Electrodes capture the electrical signals from facial muscle movements made naturally when a person is mouthing words. The signals are then translated into speech.The electrodes could be replaced with wireless chips implanted in a person's face,according to research-ers. During a demonstration held last Thursday in CMU's Pittsburgh campus,a Chinese student named Sang Jun had 11 tiny electrodes attached to the muscles of his cheeks,neck and throat. Then he mouthed-without speaking aloud- a few words in Mandarin  to the audience. A few seconds later,the phrase was displayed on a computer screen and spoken out by the computer in English and Spanish: \"Let me introduce our new prototype.\" This particular instrument,when fully developed,might allow anyone to speak in any number of lan-guages or,as Waibel put it,\"to switch your mouth to a foreign language\". \"The idea behind the universi-ty's prototypes is to create'good enough' bridges for cross- cultural exchanges that are becoming more common in the world,\"Waibel said. With spontaneous  translators,foreign drivers in Germany  could listen to traffic warnings on the radio; tourists in China could read all the signs and talk with local people;leaders of different coun-tries could have secret talks without any interpreters there.

      "question": "The neglected baby is crying alone. The young man, suffering from a lack of sleep, threatens suicide. The marriage fails because of the husband's crazy behavior. Is this just another story of social breakdown in the modern age? Not really. But they are the effects of a real social problem--Internet Addiction , or, Internet Addiction Disorder. The addiction is obvious from the popularity of one game alone: \"Halo 2\". It's a first-person shooter developed by Bungie Studios for the Xbox video game console. By early 2005, 1 million players worldwide had clocked up an amazing 100 million hours on the game, among which are 360, 000 Chinese players. China has about 94 million regular Internet users. Of these, a survey suggested, 4.4 million are teenagers who are so addicted to it that they neglect anything else. Video gamers who have gone too far show symptoms similar to those of alcohol and drug abusers. \"The real world meant nothing to me when I was fully involved in online games. I lost track of time, space, hunger, pain, and everything,\" explained Liu Pinyi, a 19-year-old college dropout. She has had treatment in Beijing for her addiction. What makes it similar to drugs is that online game addicts also develop a chemical imbalance in their brains. Gaming stimulates the production of a chemical compound that produces delighted or pleasant feelings. When they're away from the screen, they suffer feelings of anxiety and headaches. Experts say young people are attracted to video games partly because they are partly because they are pushed right into the center of the action. This allows them to overcome a lack of confidence which people at that age can often suffer from. How much time in total had Chinese game players spent on \"Halo 2\" by early 2005?",

      "question": "Three armed robbers stole two Pablo Picasso prints from an art museum in downtown Sao Paulo on Thursday, which was the city's second high-profile art theft in less than a year. The bandits also took two oil paintings by well-know Brazilian artists Emiliano Di Cavalcanti and Lasar Segall, said Carla Regina, a spokeswoman for the Pinacoteca do Estado museum. The Picasso prints stolen were \"The Painter and the Model\" from 1963 and \"Minotaur, Drinker and Women\" from 1933, according to a statement from the Sao Paulo Secretary of State for Culture, which oversees the museum. The prints and paintings have a combined value of $612,000, the statement and a museum official said. About noon, three armed men paid the $2.45 entrance fee and immediately went to the second-floor gallery where the works were being exhibited, bypassing more valuable pieces, authorities said. \"This indicates to us that they probably received an order\" to take those specific works, Youssef Abou Chain, head of Sao Paulo's organized crime unit, told reporters at a news conference. The assailants overpowered three unarmed museum guards and grabbed the works, officials said. The robbery took about 10 minutes and the museum was nearly empty at the time. The assailants took the pieces -- frames and all -- out of the museum in two bags. The institution has no metal detectors. In December, Picasso's \"Portrait of Suzanne Bloch\" and \"O Lavrador de Cafe\" by Candido Portinari, an influential Brazilian artist, were stolen from the Sao Paulo Museum of Art by three men who used a crowbar and car jack to force open one of the museum's steel doors. The framed paintings were found Jan. 8, covered in plastic and leaning against a wall in a house on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, South America's largest city. One of the suspects in that robbery -- a former TV chef -- turned himself over to police in January, who already had two suspects in custody . What did the armed men steal on Thursday?",

The astronauts carried out repair work and did experiments on the Tiangong-1.

No respectable cowboy, however, would wear short sleeves so I sweated while I played. One day my parents gave me a bb gun. It looked just like a gun that all the cowboys used in the movies. I spent hours each day during those summer months shooting at stumps and pretending to be John Wayne (film actor who played tough heroes). As I was coming into the house one afternoon, though, I tried it one time too many. The gun that I thought was empty let out a soft pop and a bullet flew across the room and parted the hair of my Dad who was asleep on the couch. My Dad took one look at the bb hole a half inch above his head, walked over to me, took my gun, walked outside, and calmly broke it in half. I didn't cry too much over this. I knew how close I had come to hurting my Dad with my stupidity. I didn't expect to ever get another bb gun either. That is why I was so surprised when my Dad bought me another one the next year. I guess he thought I had wised up enough to know how to use it this time. I never put a single bb in the new gun, but in my imagination John Wayne rode again. I eventually outgrew my cowboy stage, but I never did outgrow my appreciation for my Father's forgiveness. He showed me that even when I messed up in the worse way I was still loved. He gave me another chance and let me know that I was forgiven whether I deserved it or not. He shared with me some of the unconditional love and forgiveness.

      "question": "Today there are 7 billion people on the earth.By the year 2050 there may be 9.0 billion.We will have a lot more people to feed.We need more food. One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic  material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural. They may feed people,then hurt them or their children later.But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use,and they are not going to die.In 2050 we may think differently about them. What do you think of the GM plant?",

Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles.But for Frank's Bike Shop,a small business on Christopher St.,the bike--share program has been bad news.Owner Frank Arroyo said his rental business has decreased by 90% since City Bike was rolled out last month.Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists,who have since been drawn away by City Bikes.

      "question": "It's hard to avoid looking like a fool on April Fool's Day. On April 1 each year, people play tricks on each other. These tricks are usually silly rather than mean. Classmates sometimes tie each other's shoelaces to their chairs.Teachers might hand out an impossibly difficult surprise test that scares students before they realize it's only a joke. Newspapers announce fake  contests (such as \"Win an elephant!\") and report on fake stories (like \"UFO\" lands in New York City). Forget gifts, songs and special foods--those are for the other holidays of the year. On April Fool's Day, the only tradition is to laugh (and maybe to cause a little bit of trouble). One April Fool's Day, when I was in high school, a group of students in my class played a very clever and funny trick on the teachers. They bought some chickens and set them free in our school cafeteria. The chickens ran all round the school, in and out of classrooms and under our feet. Feathers were flying everywhere. Teachers began running after the chickens, trying to catch them. Finally, they caught four of them. But the chickens were wearing numbered tags   around their necks, and the teachers discovered that they had only caught chickens No.1, 2, 3, and 5.Where was chicken No.4? The teachers looked and looked. They couldn't find another chicken. After a few hours, they realized that the students had played another joke on them: There were only four chickens in the first place! They've been tricked by the numbers on the chickens. It's been a long time since I was in high school, but that April Fool's Day remains one of my favorite memories from those years. How many jokes did the students play on teachers?",

      "question": "When it's 10:15 in New York, it's 9:15 in Salt Lake City, and 7:15 in San Francisco - isn't it? This consistent and orderly time system, based on a grid of time zones, seems so natural that people rarely give it a moment's thought. So you may find it surprising to learn that prior to the late 1800s each community established its own time - by looking at the sun. When the sun shone directly overhead in Washington, D.C., for example, it was 12:00 noon there; up the road in Philadelphia, however, it was 12:07, and in Boston it was 12:24. To measure time with   accuracy, it is necessary to move the clock about one minute for every twelve miles of distance; so according to \"sun time\" your pocket watch would be slightly incorrect if you ventured only a few miles down the road. It was not until the advent of widespread railroad travel that a need arose for regularized time. At one point over 300 local times were honored within the country, making it literally impossible for trains to arrive consistently on time everywhere. As a result, in 1883 the continental, United States was divided into four time longitude. The standardization resulting from this system proved so helpful that in 1884 the International Meridian Conference applied the same procedure to establish time zones around the world. Thus, if it is 11:07 p.m. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, a little simple research will quickly determine that in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, it is 9:07 A.M. - and not 9:15. This passage is organized as_.",

      "question": "I love sleeping. It's something I'm good at. There's nothing better than nodding off on the sofa in front of the TV and when my head hits the pillow at night, I have no problem falling into a deep sleep within minutes. There is one place where I never nap   and that's at work--but new research suggests I should! The idea of you and your colleagues heading off for a lie down in the afternoon may seem strange, but some companies such as Google and Facebook actually encourage it. Because it's thought that a power-nap makes them more refreshed and more focused, and this in turn makes them more productive. An Australian health writer called Victoria is a founder of a campaign called Nap Now which is trying to make sleeping at work more acceptable. She calls herself a \" _ \"! She says: \"I think that our culture is a bit crazy not to accept it... It's time to end the common work principle which is all about working longer and harder.\" So should we all be taking a sleeping bag and pillow to work with us? A few years ago, research by the East of England Development Agency found 30% of people have their best ideas in bed compared to just 11% who have them at their desk. That suggests people are more creative when they are relaxed--and the agency has called for companies to put beds in the workplace. A nap in the afternoon is nothing new. In certain hot countries, such as Spain, a short rest or sleep in the afternoon-called a siesta-is perfectly normal. So maybe we should break from the traditional nine-to-five work culture and take up the siesta. The UK's Sleep Council claims the nine-to-five working day does not fit into the natural sleeping pattern of the human race and says that bosses need to introduce a more sleep-friendly working day.

      "question": "We all think that we know what happiness is. We all seem to be making great efforts towards this goal of happiness but what is it really? It is an agreed fact that all the creatures want happiness and are afraid of pain and sadness. The question, however, is \"what is real happiness?\" What really is called happiness? The desire for happiness has no meaning without understanding the real nature of happiness. Some thinkers say, \"Happiness does not lie in objects of enjoyment; happiness or unhappiness lies in imagination.\" To prove their belief, they give examples like the following one: A man has a two-storey house; on the right is a five-storey building and on the left a cottage. When he sees right, he feels unhappy and when he sees left he feels happy. As such happiness does not lie in possession of sensory objects, but in imagination. They advise people to look towards those who have fewer possessions and be happy. If you look towards people having more wealth and possessions, you will always be unhappy. It is unreasonable to hold this point of view. It is unkind to regard one happy by imagining that one is better than the poor and the unhappy. \"If you want to be happy, look towards the poor\". We know that those poor people cannot satisfy even their basic needs. This attitude satisfies the sense of pride of possessions, but this can never be called happiness. Unless we really find where happiness lies, we cannot really be happy. Some ask people to do this and do that and say, \"This way your desires would be satisfied. You would get the desired objects and become happy.\" People holding these views regard happiness as satisfaction of desires. But it is not possible to satisfy one's desires because there are countless desires of countless people and the material things are limited. Then new desires arise as soon as the previous ones are satisfied. Therefore, desires, which are changing all the time, can never be satisfied. Happiness is a characteristic of a good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills   human nature in an excellent way. People have a set of purposes which are typically human: these belong to our nature. Happiness is also a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated  , and defended privately by each person. People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives and come to being happy. Happiness lies in the distribution of easiness among others. Happiness stands for forgiveness and justice. Happiness is the name of struggle and courage. Happiness may be founded in seeking of true knowledge and rule of wisdom. Happiness may be shared in service and duty. This life is combination of joys and sorrows, and honest efforts should be done to make this life journey full of happiness, love, peace and harmony.

      "question": "In China, chain restaurants - especially the big multinational ones - are cool. Going to Starbucks, for example, is a status symbol. It not only says, \"I'm rich enough to buy this overpriced coffee,\" but also, \"I'm cosmopolitan   enough to be part of globalization.\" Where I come from in the UK, however, chains are neither fashionable nor gourmet . Chains are where you go on New Year's Day when nowhere else is open, or when you are 5 years old and your parents can't stand hearing, \"I'm huuuuuungry!\" any longer. In my own case (with regards to McDonald's), a chain is where you are taken on your first \"date\". Even at the age of 13, I knew to give the guy the \"let's just be friends\" phone call the next day. In the UK, independent cafes and restaurants are making a comeback on the fashion scene. Nowadays, a Londoner who says \"let's meet for a coffee at Monmouth\" (an independent cafe) is much cooler than one who says \"let's go to Starbucks\". Even if Monmouth's coffee is a little more expensive, there's a satisfaction in knowing your pounds aren't going straight to the big corporations.

Some believe the tradition comes from the ancient Romans more than two thousand years ago. It was a day of playing games and pretending to be someone else. Others say the day for fooling began in France in 1564, when King Charles changed the yearly calendar . He moved New Year's Day from April 1 to January 1. Many people did not know about the change because of communication problems back then. Some people continued to celebrate New Year's Day on April 1. Other people called them April Fools and played jokes on them. In the United States, April Fools' Day is just a day of joking and playing tricks on friends. These kinds of jokes are also called pranks. These jokes typically end in the prankster shouting \"April Fools'!\" Simple pranks, like telling a friend a funny lie or making prank phone calls, are still common.

They can't wait to open the presents in their stockings. Then they wake up their parents and shout 'Merry Christmas!' Do you know what Christmas means? Christmas Day is the birthday of Jesus Christ. When Christ was born, many people gave him presents. So today, people still do the same thing to children. Christmas Eve is   _  .",

      "question": "Jesse was a great teacher, tutor, mentor, and family member. He was a dedicated  volunteer in the Peace Corps in Guinea, West Africa. He went to a place where he knew he could make a difference and wanted to help teach children who otherwise would not have a teacher. He made friends wherever he went and touched the hearts of many. Jesse was never one to go anywhere without making a good impression on everyone he met. His sudden death in a tragic car accident in Africa brought his family and friends together in a celebration of his life. They came from all over: Africa, Canada, the US. The church was filled with people who knew that Jesse had made a difference in their lives, in the lives of the children, and in the hearts of his loved ones. Jesse volunteered with the Peace Corps to help educate children in Guinea, Africa. Guinea is a very poor and complex country where tribalism  is strong. Each tribe that Jesse worked with wanted him to commit to one or the other. Jesse would not surrender to tribalism when he took an African name, and he wanted a tribal last name. Each of the two tribes in which he taught insisted that he choose their name. He would not choose but married the tribes' two names into one. Jesse was a light to all who knew him. We will always remember the joy and love he brought to his work, to his family, his friends. The people who loved Jesse are planning to build a school in Guinea in his honor. So his work continues...

      "question": "Rhinos  are big and can be dangerous. They are also shy and seldom seen. Once there were hundreds of rhino species, but today there are only five. One ancient rhino called Indricotherium was the largest land mammal that ever lived. It was 5m high at the shoulders, and 8.5m long-- twice the size of today's biggest elephant! The living rhinos are still big, averaging 2-3m long and weighing up to 3,600kg. To see all five species of living rhino you would need to do a bit of exploring. First you might visit Africa for a look at the white rhino and the black rhino. They live in Africa's dry woodlands and grasslands. Then you could head to India and Nepal for a look at the Indian rhino. It lives in the high grasslands near rivers, where you have to ride an elephant to find one. Finally you might travel to the rainforests on the islands of Indonesia to see the Sumatran and Javan rhinos. These are the smallest and rarest rhinos in the world and extremely difficult to find. Most rhinos are gentle and timid  .They have a bad reputation for being very , but that may be partly because they get frightened easily. Also, they have poor eyesight. They rely on their strong sense of smell to tell them a stranger is approaching, but if the wind is blowing the wrong way, they may not know someone is there until it's too late. Rhinos can be found only in their habitats, which is why habitat destruction has caused rhino populations to decline. As they disappear from certain places, their absence leads to many changes to the landscape. For example, black rhinos in Africa only eat shrubs   and small trees, pruning   the plants and limiting their growth. Many other species benefit from this, and as rhinos disappear, so do many other animals sharing their habitat. Bushes and trees take over the land and force species like the antelope to leave in search of food. In a short time the whole habitat has changed. The white rhino can be found in   _   .",

      "question": "When one loves one's Art, no service seems too hard. Joe was a man with a genius  for art. Delia did things in six octaves  promisingly. Joe and Delia became in love with one of the other, or each of the other, as you please, and in a short time were married - for (see above), when one loves one's Art no service seems too hard. They began housekeeping in a flat. It was a lonesome  flat, but they were happy; for they had their Art, and they had each other. Joe was learning painting in the class of the great Magister - you know his fame. His fees are high; his lessons are light - his high-lights have brought him fame. Delia was studying under      Rosenstock - you know his reputation as a disturber of the piano keys. They were mighty  happy as long as their money lasted. After a while, Art flagged . Everything going out and nothing coming in, money was lacking to pay Mr. Magister and Rosenstock their prices. When one loves one's Art, no service seems too hard. So, Delia said she must give music lessons to make the ends meet. For two or three days she went out looking for pupils. One evening she came home overjoyed. \"Joe, dear,\" she said, cheerfully, \"I've a pupil. And, oh, the loveliest people! General - General Pinkney's daughter Clementina - on Seventy-first street.\" \"That's all right for you, Dele,\" said Joe, \"but how about me? Do you think I'm going to let you work while I play in the regions of high art? \" Delia came and hung about his neck. \"Joe, dear, you are silly. You must keep on at your studies. It is not as if I had quit my music and gone to work at something else. While I teach I learn. I am always with my music.\" \"All right,\" said Joe. \"But I may sell some of my pictures as well.\" The next few weeks, they both busied themselves with their own business and brought back a ten, a five, a two and a one - all legal tender notes - and laid them beside each others' earnings. One Saturday evening Joe reached home first. He spread his $18 on the table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands. Half an hour later Delia arrived, her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle  of wraps and bandages . \"How is this?\" asked Joe. Delia laughed, but not very joyously. \"Clementina,\" she explained, \"insisted upon a Welsh rabbit  after her lesson. In serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it, boiling hot, over my wrist. Nothing serious, dear.\" \"What time this afternoon did you burn your hand, Dele?\" \"Five o'clock, I think,\" said Dele. \"The iron - I mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time.\" \"Sit down here a moment, Dele,\" said Joe. \"What have you been doing for the last few weeks, Dele?\" he asked. She braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness, but at last down went her head and out came the truth and tears. \"I couldn't get any pupils,\" she wept. \"I got a place ironing shirts in that big Twenty-fourth street laundry . A girl in the laundry set down a hot iron  on my hand this afternoon. I think I did very well to make up both General Pinkney and Clementina. What made you ever suspect that I wasn't giving music lessons?\" \"I didn't,\" said Joe, \"until tonight. And I wouldn't have then, only I sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine-room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing-iron. I've been firing the engine in that laundry for the last few weeks.\" \"And then you didn't ...\" said Delia And then they both looked at each other and laughed, and Joe began: \"When one loves one's Art no service seems ...\" But Delia stopped him with her hand on his lips. \"No,\" she said - \"just 'When one loves.'\" What can serve as the best title of this story?",

      "question": "Contestants from around the world met in Pomona, California, this month to test their skills at things like driving a car, walking down stairs, and opening doors. Sounds easy, right? But the competitors weren't people--they were robots! The bots were participating in  the final round of the US's DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Robotics Challenge. This event, which took place on June 5-6, tested robots on how well they could respond during a disaster and the winning team finally took home a $2 million grand prize. The DARPA challenge was created after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. An earthquake caused a tsunami, which damaged a nuclear power plant. Workers at the plant needed to shut off an important valve , but it was too dangerous for humans to reach it. The US scientists at DARPA wondered whether the disaster could have been avoided if a robot had been sent to do _ . So they set up the robotics competition. Turning a valve was just one task a robot might have to perform when entering a disaster zone. In addition to doing this, robots participating in the challenge had to navigate a course containing several other tasks: driving and exiting a vehicle, opening a door, walking over or clearing objects, cutting a hole in a wall, plus climbing a flight of stairs. Teams had to complete the challenge in one hour, and points were awarded based on how quickly the robots completed a task. They didn't have to attempt all the tasks. To make things even more realistic, challenge organizers caused short computer-system blackouts  that prevented robots and the human operators controlling them from communicating. That means teams had to program their robots to be partially autonomous . Robots also couldn't be attached to anything that could keep them from falling down, which happened a lot.

They left her long ago. At the orphanage, the girl, like all the children there, was taught to read and write. While she was studying at the orphanage, she learned something else-to be independent . At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began to work as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong Competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody. Mary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something. Winning the competition gave her the chance to start a new life. This led her first into television and then into business as a manager. When she was working as a manager, she had trouble with her reports. \"My English just wasn't good enough.\" she says. Luckily, she had a boyfriend (who later became her husband) to help her. Mary studied management  at Hong Kong Polytechnic and graduated in 1980. She started her own business in 1985. But she did not stop developing herself. She then studied at the University of Hong Kong. Since 1987, she had spent a lot of time on photography .

This trip was probably about 20 years ago so it was before the time of things like portable video games and being able to watch movies in the back seat.2 So to pass the many hours of travel my brother and I had to entertain ourselves and each other. My mum would set the back seat up so that it was our own little playroom. She would pack everything up so that we had a big level area to play in. We would play cards and board games.C When it got to the point where we were at each other's throats we would be sent back to our own side of the seat and would be forced to either nap or read by ourselves until we could be friendly to each other again. I can remember us playing for quite some time when we turned the back seat into a spaceship and traveled around the earth.f Another time we turned it into a kitchen and had a bake-off . But the thing that I remember the most and that gave us many hours of enjoyment was using each other's faces as silly Plasticine  and making funny faces. We would see how far we could stretch each other's mouths open, see how thin we could make the other's eye by pulling on it. We would keep going until one of us begged for mercy because we had to give our faces a rest.7 So while I can remember us having a great time on the beach, laughing a lot trying to put the tent up in the rain, what I remember the most of that trip and what always makes me smile the most is remembering the pain that our faces would be in after the trip.g What does the author mean by saying \"we were at each other's throats\"?A",

      "question": "Sometimes teens   need to have some time away from their families. They may want to move out of the family or home for a while. Many parents will say no to this demand. But experts say it might be a good idea to let your teens live with a friend or a relative. \"It was the break I needed at the time,\" said Richard Lerne. He is talking about the time he spent living with his grandmother when he was 15. \"It allowed me to be a more different person than I was with my parents.\" Lerne said. He now heads the Institute for Children, Youth and Families at Michigan State University. Experts say teens living away from their families can test new ways of thinking and getting along with people. They may see new ways to problems. Some teens who want some time away from family attend a structured summer program. Others live for a while with a relative or with the family of a friend. If there is conflict   at home, having a teen live elsewhere can benefit other family members. It gives everyone space to develop better relationships. Joseph Kett teaches history at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He says living at home until the late ten years has become the norm   only in recent times. \"In the 17th century, children were often sent to live in other people's home when they were about 10 or 11\", he said. Peter Sheras teaches education at the University of Virginia. He says parents should listen when a child wants to move out. They should try to find out why the child wants some time away.

      "question": "An annoying problem for humans, who like to boast   about all the distant planets and moons we have explored, is that we've never taken a good look right under our noses. The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust   (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle  . Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust ---  about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack  . Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten   iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we haven't been before,\"he says. \"In all possibility, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem. Great things can come from what seems like impossible ideas. How deep have we gone into the earth until now?",

While the youth stood on the landing-place searching in his pockets for money, the ferryman lifted a lantern, by the aid of which, together with the newly risen moon, he took a very accurate survey of the stranger's figure. He was a young man of barely eighteen years, evidently country bred , and now, as it seemed, on his first visit to town. He was wearing a rough gray coat, which was in good shape, but which had seen many winters before this one. The garments under his coat were well constructed of leather, and fitted tightly to a pair of muscular legs; his stockings of blue yarn must have been the work of a mother or sister, and on his head was a three-cornered hat, which in its better days had sheltered the grayer head of the lad's father. In his left hand was a walking stick, and his equipment was completed by a leather bag not so abundantly stocked as to inconvenience the strong shoulders on which it hung. Brown, curly hair, well-shaped-features, bright, cheerful eyes were nature's gifts, and worth all that art could have done for his adornment . The youth, whose name was Robin, paid the boatman, and then walked forward into the town with a light step, as if he had not already traveled more than thirty miles that day.

She was surprised, so as not to appear rude, she went along. As they sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything and she felt uncomfortable. Suddenly, he asked the waiter, \"Could you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee.\" They stared at him. He turned red, but when the salt came, he put it in his coffee and drank. Curious, she asked, \"Why salt with coffee?\" He explained, \"When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea. I liked playing on the sea. I could feel it salty, like salty coffee. Now every time I drink it, I think of my childhood and my hometown. I miss it and my parents, who are still there.\" She was deeply moved. A man who can admit that he's homesick must love his home and care about his family. He must be responsible. She talked too, about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was the start to their love story. They continued to date. She found that he met all her requirements. He was tolerant, kind, warm and careful. And to think she would have missed the catch if not for the salty coffee! So they married and lived happily together. And every time she made coffee for him, she put in some salt, the way he liked it. After 40 years, he passed away and left her a letter which said: My dearest, please forgive my life-long lie.

      "question": "Early this morning, I got up to make a batch of Rice Krispie Treats for my neighbor across the hall. She barely greets me when we see each other, and her sweet little boy, who's now four,  has picked up her mother's manner and will not talk to me, either. Last Monday, she had called the firefighters when a pan I'd forgotten on the stove caused my flat to fog up while I was out taking a walk. When I came home, the street in front of our apartment house was blocked by a police car, a fire truck and an ambulance! The instant I saw them, I remembered the pan! Luckily, nothing serious had happened, and all my neighbors agreed with the firefighter who said, \"It could have happened to anyone.\" When I thanked the neighbor who had called the firefighters-let's call her Ivy-and apologized for causing the trouble, she just asked if my cats were all right.When I said they were fine, she said, \"Well, that's ok then,\" and turned into her flat.l felt strangely safe, knowing that even though we don't get along, she'd done the right thing and didn't blame me.So, the Rice Krispie Treats. Last Christmas, my neighbor carelessly let it out that she was holding a grudge   towards me because of an incident we'd had four years ago.I had particularly apologized and asked if there was anything I could do to improve our relationship. She would not accept my apology. It had taken me a lot of courage to apologize and ask that question instead of insisting that we both shared responsibility for what had happened.Her flat-out refusal to make amends  really shocked and saddened me.After that, I decided I'd just leave her be-a relationship takes two to work.So, you see, I was really scared she was going to refuse my offer again, leaving me standing on her doorstep, facing the closed door and holding my plate of treats. I know some people have a hard time understanding how the possibility of rejection can make an adult so afraid, but that's just the way I felt. Then, I reminded myself of how loving and good I had felt yesterday when I'd done some random acts of kindness (thanks to helpothers.org), after telling myself: Feet the fear,  and do it anyway! So I put the squares of Rice Krispie Treats on a beautiful plate, opened my apartment  door-and there she was, standing in the hallway.I smiled and said, \"Hi,\" but when she saw me, she turned on her heels and went back inside, even though she seemed to have just stepped out.I went after her, regardless, and quickly said, \"I'm sorry, I've got something for you ! I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you were paying attention on Monday.\" When she heard me speaking, she turned around. As I held the plate towards her, explaining these were very sweet American treats, and that she could just try and see whether she and her family would like them, her eyebrows winged up-and she took the plate.l was so happy and excited.We then talked a bit about how she'd become aware of the smoke in my flat, and parted ways. Back in my place, I did a \"happy dance\", because I had dared to be kind even though I hadn't been sure at all my kindness would be welcome.I do hope that our relationship will slowly get better; I know I was and still am biased towards her at times, but even if we don't make amends, I want to be able to be kind without depending on other people's behaviors and reactions .

      "question": "A person who is deaf when he is born is usually dumb   as well. There may be nothing wrong with his mouth and tongue, but he cannot speak. This is because he cannot hear people, so he has nothing to imitate  . He may try to make sounds himself, but cannot hear his own voice. However, even though he finds it difficult to speak and cannot hear, he can learn to read. Nowadays such persons can also be taught to speak because we have modern methods and equipment, but we did not have these when Helen Keller was born.      Even with modern methods and equipment, however, it is not easy for deaf children to learn to speak, though most of them succeed. When a child is deaf and blind as well, it becomes much more difficult, though it is possible. Helen Keller was born in 1880. She became very ill at the age of nineteen months. Medical knowledge was not as great then as it is now. She did not die but lost her sight and hearing. As a result, she became dumb as well. Her parents did their best to teach her, but she couldn't speak by the age of six.      Then, in 1887, a teacher, Miss Sullivan, came to live with her. Miss Sullivan herself had been blind. She had been partly cured. Though she could not see very well, she was not blind. Helen was a difficult pupil at first, but in a month Helen had learned how to understand signs and how to make them herself. At last in spite of her great difficulties, Helen learned to read, write and speak, even though she was deaf and blind. She even went to college and had full education. She wrote many books, and though other people have written books about her, her own books are the ones that best explain how it feels to be deaf, dumb and blind. Her best book is The Story of My Life. Perhaps you have read it. Though it was written in 1902, it is still a very interesting book. Even if you have not read it, you may have heard of Helen Keller.

Dang Xianhong,the spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau,said rapid social change is one of the reasons behind the rising number of youngsters with psychological problems.If these mental dispenses are not addressed on time, science of crimes,drug-taking and other dangerous behaviors are expected to rise.Experts said mental diseases could be caused by many factors,such as the inability to handle interpersonal relations well, unstable emotions and pressures from an overload of studies.A number of experts have also said the one child policy is another reason leading to poor mental health in the young.Children are said to be too \"spoiled\" and \"selfish\" in a one child family.

      "question": "A small ,white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree and it has been there for the past ten years or so. It all began because my husband Justin hated Christmas--oh, not the true meaning of Christmas.Overspending was one thing, but compared to the difficult experience of choosing gifts--running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and a pair of gloves for Grandma...,spending money is nothing. I felt too tired to think of any special gifts. Knowing Justin felt the same way, I decided one year not to buy the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so on. I reached for something special just for Justin. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was wrestling  at the junior level at the school he attended; and shortly before Christmas, there was a match against a team sponsored   by an inner-city church.These youngsters, dressed in such worn-out shoes that shoe strings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, while our boys were in their blue and gold uniforms and new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was shocked to see that the other team were wrestling without wearing helmets   to protect their ears. Well, our boys ended up defeating them. We took every weight class. Justin, seated beside me, shook his head sadly, \"I wish just one of them could have won,\" he said. \"They have a lot potential   , but losing like this could take the heart out of them.\" Justin loved kids--all kids, and he knew them, having coached little league football and baseball. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought different kinds of wrestling helmets and shoes. I sent them to inner-city church without leaving my name. On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Justin what I had done and that was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year and since then the envelope has become the highlight of our Christmas. How did Justin feel about the team's failure ?",

The Olympian athletic festival held every four years in honor of Zeus, king of the Olympian Gods, eventually lost its local character, became first a national event and then,after the rules against foreign competitors had been put to an end, international. No one knows how far back the Olympic Games go, but some official records date from 776 BC.  The games took place in August on the plain by Mount Olympus. Many thousands of people gathered from all parts of   Greece to watch the games, but no married woman was admitted even for watching. Slaves, women and dishonored persons were not allowed to compete. The exact sequence of events is uncertain, but events included boy's gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, horse racing and field events, though there were fewer sports involved than in the modern Olympic Games. On the last day of the Games, all the winners were honored by having a ring of holy olive  leaves placed on their heads. So great was the honor that the winner of the foot race gave his name to the year of his victory. Although Olympic winners received no money, they were, in fact, richly rewarded by their state authorities. In the early days of ancient Olympic Games  _  .",

      "question": "Recordings of angry bees are enough to send big, tough African elephants running away, a new study says. Beehives  -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops. In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today,  Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away. Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family. From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall   instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place. Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times. She hasn't tested enough groups yet to know, but her initial   results were promising enough to begin trials with farmers. She has now begun placing speakers in the fields to see if elephants are frightened away. Why did Lucy throw a stone into a wild beehive?",

      "question": "Do you know anything about the history of weather? Don't look at the sky. Don't look for old weather reports. Looking at the tree rings is more important. Correct weather reports date back only one century, but some trees can provide an exact record of weather even further back. It is natural that a tree would grow best in a climate with plenty of sunlight and rainfall. It is also expected that little sunlight or rainfall would reduce the growth of a tree. The change from a favorable to an unfavorable climate can be found out by the reading pattern of rings in a tree trunk. To find out the weather of ten years ago, you can count the rings of a tree trunk from the outside to the inside. If the tenth ring is far from the other rings, then it is certain that plenty of sunny and rainy weather occurred. If the rings are close together, then the climate was bad for the tree.   Studying trees is important not only for the history of weather, but also for the history of man. In an area of New Mexico you can find only sand -- no trees or people. However, many centuries ago a large population lived there. They left suddenly. Why?   A scientist studied the pattern of the rings of dead trees that had grown there. He made up his mind that the people had to leave because they had cut down all the trees. Trees were necessary to make fires and buildings. So, after the people destroyed the trees, they had to move.   In this example studying tree rings uncovered an exciting fact about the history of man. The ancient people usually lived where there were plenty of trees mainly because   _  .",

      "question": "The addictive pull of Internet shopping is dragging thousands of victims into a rise of debt, including thousands of women who have run up huge credit card bills they cannot repay.  The appeal of 24-hour access and the explosion in goods and services on offer has seen a 10 percent increase in credit card debts in the UK this year.  Much of it has accounted for online spending. The latest report on Internet usage shows the number of adults logging on at home has risen from 10 million in October last year to 15.5m this month.  The report by Continental Research, which has monitored Internet access in the UK for the past six years, found that while online shopping used to be experimental it is now becoming habitual, especially for women.  Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, \"Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this.\" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper.  The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000.  He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. \"You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,\" he said. \"It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.\" Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit. It also provides secrecy---a central part of any addiction. Dr Samantha Haslett, a psychologist and expert in addiction at the Promos counseling centre, said, \"It's compulsive in the same way as alcohol and gambling, and addicts find themselves completely unable to stop themselves, despite debt mounting and relationships breaking up. It's the thrill and the buzz of purchasing that ignores all the negative consequences.\" People laugh at shopping addictions, but it's the same as food overeating:bulimicsdon't eat nice stuff, or things that are good for them. Shopping addicts are the same: they'll buy things they don't need or want or like. What they're buying is of no importance compared to the thrill they get spending money and acquiring something new. I've counseled people who have bought piles of bed linen and curtains and just left them piled up in the corner of the room.  I have seen people's marriages ruined. There's something more damaging about Internet shopping too because it takes place in the home, so the trick and secrecy is that much closer to the partner who is being tricked.  Tennis star Serena Williams this year admitted to kicking an Internet shopping addiction that saw her spending up to six hours a day online in an attempt to avoid being seen out in public.  \"Every day I was in my room and I was online,\" Williams said. \"I wasn't able to stop and I bought, bought, bought. I was just out of control.\" Confidence is also growing in online security. Danny Meadows-Klue, chairman of Interactive Advertising Bureau, the Internet commercial watchdog, said, \"Online card fraud is a drop in the ocean compared to total credit card fraud, but it is increasing. We want to increase consumer confidence by encouraging shoppers to take simple steps to protect themselves.\" But there are still barriers to online shopping, declares James Goudie, a consumer psychologist at North Umbria University. \"For certain items some people prefer to shop personally, for example to try on an item of clothing and feel the quality.

      "question": "Gwendolyn Brooks wrote hundreds of poems during her lifetime. She was known around the world for using poetry to increase understanding of black culture in America. During the 1940's and the 1950's, Gwendolyn Brooks used her poems to describe conditions among the poor,racial  inequality and drug use in the black community. She also wrote poems about the struggles of black women. But her skill was more than her ability to write about struggling black people. She combined traditional European poetry styles with the African American experience. Gwendolyn Brooks once said that she wrote about what she saw and heard in the street. She said she found most of her materials through looking out of the window of her second-floor apartment in Chicago, Illinois. In her early poetry, Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about the South Side of Chicago, where many black people live. In her poems, the South Side is called Bronzeville. It was \"A Street in Bronzeville\" that gained the attention of literary experts in 1945. Critics praised her poetic skills and her powerful descriptions about the black experience during the time. The Bronzeville poems were her first published collection. In 1950, Gwendolyn Brooks became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for Literature. She won the prize for her second book of poems called \"Annie Allen\". \"Annie Allen\" is a collection of poetry about a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother. She experiences loneliness, loss, death andpoverty . Gwendolyn Brooks said that winning the prize changed her life. Her next work was a novel written in 1953 called \"Maud Martha\". \"Maud Martha\" attracted little attention when it was first published. But now it is considered an important work by some critics. Its main ideas about the difficult lives of many women are popular among female writers today. Which of the following can we learn from the text?",

Next!\"This version of the expression is spoken by a salesgirl at the supermarket who is rushing me and my groceries out the door. The words come out in the same tone with a fixed procedure. They are spoken at me, not to me. Obviously, the concern for my day and everyone else's is the management's attempt to increase business. The expression is one of those behaviors that help people get along with each other. Sometimes it indicates the end of a meeting. As soon as you hear it, you know the meeting is at an end. Sometimes the expression saves us when we don't know what to say \"oh, you may have a tooth out? I'm terribly sorry, but have a nice day.\" The expression can be pleasant. If a stranger says \"Have a nice day\" to you, you may find it heart-warming because someone you don't know has tried to be nice to you.

It became an accepted name for fake goods   after \"Shanzhai Cellphones\" produced by small workshops in southern China became popular in the mainland market over the past two years. Besides \"Shanzhai\" electronic products, there are \"Shanzhai\" movies, \"Shanzhai\" stars and even a \"Shanzhai\" Spring Festival Gala , a copy of the 25-year-old traditional show presented by CCTV on Chinese Lunar New Year's Eve.  \"Shanzhai\" has become a culture of its own, standing foranything that _ something famous,which has caused a public debate over whether it is healthy or sick being a copycat. In southwestern China's Chongqing, a \"Shanzhai\"-version \"Bird's Nest\" built by farmers with bamboo attracts wide attention and the \"Shanzhai\"-version \"Water Cube\" is popular with tourists. Both are copies of the famous Olympics places in Beijing.  Xie Xizhang, a literature critic, said that taking the \"Shanzhai\" Gala as an example, when the traditional CCTV program becomes less and less attractive to the audience, the \"Shanzhai\" version appears naturally to attract people.  \"In spite of its poor techniques and operation, 'Shanzhai' culture meets the demands of common people and could be a comfort to their minds,\" Xie said.   Tian Huiqun, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said that \"Shanzhai\" culture never copies classic things, only products in fashion.

        "question": "I used to watch her from my kitchen window. She seemed so small as she muscled her way through the crowd of boys on the playground. The school was across the street from our home and I would often watch the kids as they played during break. I remember the first day I saw her playing basketball. I watched in wonder as she ran circles around the other kids. She managed to shoot jump shots just over their heads and into the net. The boys always tried to stop her but no one could. I began to notice her at other times, basketball in hand, playing alone. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. Without a moment of hesitation she said, \"I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship. I am going to play college basketball. I want to be the best. My Daddy told me if the dream is big enough, the facts don't count.\" Well, I had to give it to her--she was determined. I watched her through those junior high years and into high school. Every week, she led her school team to victory. One day in her senior year, I saw her sitting in the grass, head in her arms. I walked across the street and sat down in the cool grass beside her. Quietly I asked what was wrong. \"Oh, nothing,\" came a soft reply, \"I am just too short.\" The coach told her that at 5'5\" she would probably never get to play for a top ranked team--much less offered a scholarship--so she should stop dreaming about college. She was heartbroken and I felt my own throat tighten as I sensed her disappointment. I asked her if she had talked to her dad about it yet. She told me that her father said those coaches were wrong. They just did not understand the power of a dream. He told her that if she truly wanted a scholarship and that nothing could stop her except one thing -- her own attitude. The next year, as she and her team went to the Northern California Championship game, she was offered a scholarship and on the college team. She was going to get the college education that she had dreamed of. Which proverb best matches the story?",

        "question": "Almost every child is scared of something, from monsters in the cupboard to dogs in the park. But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias  much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological  . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\"scaredy cat\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'.\" If we fail to help children to overcome fears, they will  _  .",

Perhaps you take a ride in a printed electric car to the hospital to get a printed tooth fitted. Though some of these things may seem impossible, they're closer to reality than you might think. The world of 3-D printing is coming to a store near you soon. The idea of 3-D printing is to produce complicated shapes in a very personalized way. If you want to make a totally new object, you need to make a virtual design in a CAD(computer aided design)file first. Or you can use a 3-D scanner to make a digital copy of an object. Then, based on the design or copy, the 3-D printer makes paper-thin slices out of liquid, plastic, or metal and puts them together to create the object you want. There are many areas in which 3-D printing can change our lives. One such area is health care. Researchers have developed simple 3-D printed organs, which can be used in life-saving operations. A 17-year-old boy in the US has also recently developed a brain-powered, 3-D printed replacement hand. From heart monitors to fake limbs , we can soon be living longer thanks to 3-D printed technology. Another area that 3-D technology looks sure to change is food. Can you imagine being able to print your favorite dishes at home at the touch of a button? Even big companies are behind the trend. Hersheys, one of the largest chocolate makers in the world, recently announced that it would start producing chocolate with the help of 3-D printers. NASA, the US space agency, has reportedly spent $125,000 (767,594 yuan) developing a \"3-D pizza printer\". It is not yet clear how long it will take until 3-D printers are available to everyone.

Famously known for his brief and short sentences ,Hemingway created ah interesting and unique style of writing that still appeal to readers today. Santiago was an aged Cuban fisherman, and many thought that he could no longer fish. For eighty-four days ,he set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So unlucky was he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice   and friend , Manolin , forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more profitable boat On the eighty-fifth day ,the fisherman set out into the open sea to go fishing. At noon ,a big Marlin took hold of one of the lines, but the fish was far too big for him to handle. Santiago let the fish have enough line, so that it wouIdn9t break his pole; but he and his boat were dragged out to sea for three days. Finally ,the fish grew tired. Santiago killed it Even this final victory didn't end his journey. He was still far, far out to sea. To make matters worse, Santiago dragged the Marlin behind the boat and the fish blood attracted sharks. Santiago did his best to beat the sharks away ,but his efforts were not enough, The sharks ate the flesh off the Marlin ,and Santiago was left with only the bones. Santiago was tired out He got back home with nothing to show for his pains but the skeletal  remains of a large Marlin. Even with just the bare remains of the fish, the experience changed him, and charged the opinions others had of him. Manolin , who had been worried over the old man's absence, was moved to tears when he found Santiago safe in his bed, When the old man woke ,the two agreed to fish as partners once more. With Santiago5S struggle to catch the Marlin and his journey home ,Santiago's courage was obvious as he faced challenges that just didn't seem to end.

That is a lesson I learned early on in my marriage. I realized that I couldn't rely on my husband as my source of happiness. I learned that my happiness depended on me and not my husband's actions. I learned that you have to choose to be happy. You can choose your emotions. True happiness comes from within; it can't be forced by outside forces. So how do you choose happiness? The same way you choose to smile or choose to wear a certain outfit. You choose it because that's what you want to experience in your life. You want to buy a new pair of shoes so you choose a pair that you like and feel good. You wouldn't buy a pair of shoes that you don't like or that don't fit well, right? So why do we keep choosing emotions and feelings that don't make us feel good? Choosing to be happy after you realize your anger has shown up (or even choosing to be calm) can be beneficial. We choose our feelings; no one can do that for us. If we let others get to us, influence our emotions - we are giving them power over us. When others cause us anger or pain, we are giving them our power. We need to keep our feelings in check and not react automatically to what is thrown at us. We need to think our actions out instead of just reacting to what someone says or does. Remember that we can always choose happiness. At first it will be difficult to just switch your thoughts and feelings from anger, self-doubt, or fear to joy and happiness. But it is only a thought away. Don't dwell on what happens to you unnecessarily but realize what is causing you to feel that way. Realize that thoughts, feelings and emotions can change. Then move on and choose to be happy.

The current assumption is that our basic needs for water--whether for drinking, agriculture, industry or the raising of fish--will always have to be met. Given this premise  , there are two basic routes we can go; more equal access to water or better engineering solutions. Look at the engineering solutions first. A lot of my research concentrates on what happens to wetlands when you build dams in river basins, particularly in Africa. The ecology of such areas is almost entirely driven by the seasonal changes of the river--the pulse of the water. And the fact is that if you build a dam, you generally spoil the downstream ecology. In the past, such problems have been hidden by a lack of information. But in the near future, governments will have no excuses for their ignorance. The engineers' ability to control water flows has created new kinds of unpredictability, too. Dams in Africa have meant fewer fish, less grazing and less floodplain   agriculture, none of which were expected. And there average economic life is assumed to be thirty years. Dams don't exist forever, but what will replace them is not clear. The challenge for the future is to find new means of controlling water. Although GM technology  will allow us to breed better dry-land crops, there is no market for companies to develop crops suitable for the micro-climates of the Sahel and elsewhere in Africa.

In the study, a team of UK researchers compared the performances of 120women and 120men in  a computer game involving tasks of counting and shape-recognition  Men and women were equally capable when tasks were  handled one at a time. But when the tasks started switching quickly , men responded c) much slower than women. To make the experiment more  relevant to everyday life, researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were asked to complete a series of \"everyday challenges\" such as finding restaurants on a map and searching for a lost key in a field. Once again, women outperformed men on the test, particularly in the key-searching task. \"It suggests that- in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them,'' researcher Keith Law of the University of Hertfordshire, UK, told the BBC,[ln contrast,] men had a slight impulsiveness ;they jumped in too quickly\" But where did women get the ability to keep organized under pressure? Researchers believe that it has its roots in evolution ,In early human communities, women had to keep an eye on children while cooking meals. Meanwhile, men only needed to focus on hunting. Men might not be happy about this study. After all, many great pilots are men and they have to deal with lots of information at the same time too. This is true, and researchers have their response. \"[We don't mean]that all men can't multitask, or that only women can,\" said Laws.[We are saying that] the average woman is better able to organize her time and switch  between tasks than the average man. There's no point denying these differences exist.\" Which of the following  is TRUE according to the article?",

        "question": "In a few years,you might be able to speak Chinese,Korean,Japanese,French,and English-and all at the same time. This sounds incredible,but Alex Waibel,a computer science professor at US's Car-negie Mellon University (CMU) and Germany's University of Karlsruhe,announced last week that it may soon be reality. He and his team have invented software and hardware that could make it far easier for people who speak different languages to understand each other. One application,called Lecture Translation,can easily translate a speech from one language into an-other. Current translation technologies typically limit speakers to certain topics or a limited vocabulary. Us-ers also have to be trained how to use the programme. Another machine can send translations of a speech to different listeners depending on what languagethey speak. \"It is like having a s _ translator right next to you but without disturbing the person next to you,\"Waibel said Prefer to read? So- called Translation Glasses transcribe  the translations on a tiny liquid-crystal display(LCD) screen. Then there's the Muscle Translator. Electrodes capture the electrical signals from facial muscle movements made naturally when a person is mouthing words. The signals are then translated into speech.The electrodes could be replaced with wireless chips implanted in a person's face,according to research-ers. During a demonstration held last Thursday in CMU's Pittsburgh campus,a Chinese student named Sang Jun had 11 tiny electrodes attached to the muscles of his cheeks,neck and throat. Then he mouthed-without speaking aloud- a few words in Mandarin  to the audience. A few seconds later,the phrase was displayed on a computer screen and spoken out by the computer in English and Spanish: \"Let me introduce our new prototype.\" This particular instrument,when fully developed,might allow anyone to speak in any number of lan-guages or,as Waibel put it,\"to switch your mouth to a foreign language\". \"The idea behind the universi-ty's prototypes is to create'good enough' bridges for cross- cultural exchanges that are becoming more common in the world,\"Waibel said. With spontaneous  translators,foreign drivers in Germany  could listen to traffic warnings on the radio; tourists in China could read all the signs and talk with local people;leaders of different coun-tries could have secret talks without any interpreters there.

        "question": "The neglected baby is crying alone. The young man, suffering from a lack of sleep, threatens suicide. The marriage fails because of the husband's crazy behavior. Is this just another story of social breakdown in the modern age? Not really. But they are the effects of a real social problem--Internet Addiction , or, Internet Addiction Disorder. The addiction is obvious from the popularity of one game alone: \"Halo 2\". It's a first-person shooter developed by Bungie Studios for the Xbox video game console. By early 2005, 1 million players worldwide had clocked up an amazing 100 million hours on the game, among which are 360, 000 Chinese players. China has about 94 million regular Internet users. Of these, a survey suggested, 4.4 million are teenagers who are so addicted to it that they neglect anything else. Video gamers who have gone too far show symptoms similar to those of alcohol and drug abusers. \"The real world meant nothing to me when I was fully involved in online games. I lost track of time, space, hunger, pain, and everything,\" explained Liu Pinyi, a 19-year-old college dropout. She has had treatment in Beijing for her addiction. What makes it similar to drugs is that online game addicts also develop a chemical imbalance in their brains. Gaming stimulates the production of a chemical compound that produces delighted or pleasant feelings. When they're away from the screen, they suffer feelings of anxiety and headaches. Experts say young people are attracted to video games partly because they are partly because they are pushed right into the center of the action. This allows them to overcome a lack of confidence which people at that age can often suffer from. How much time in total had Chinese game players spent on \"Halo 2\" by early 2005?",

The bandits also took two oil paintings by well-know Brazilian artists Emiliano Di Cavalcanti and Lasar Segall, said Carla Regina, a spokeswoman for the Pinacoteca do Estado museum. The Picasso prints stolen were \"The Painter and the Model\" from 1963 and \"Minotaur, Drinker and Women\" from 1933, according to a statement from the Sao Paulo Secretary of State for Culture, which oversees the museum. The prints and paintings have a combined value of $612,000, the statement and a museum official said. About noon, three armed men paid the $2.45 entrance fee and immediately went to the second-floor gallery where the works were being exhibited, bypassing more valuable pieces, authorities said. \"This indicates to us that they probably received an order\" to take those specific works, Youssef Abou Chain, head of Sao Paulo's organized crime unit, told reporters at a news conference. The assailants overpowered three unarmed museum guards and grabbed the works, officials said. The robbery took about 10 minutes and the museum was nearly empty at the time. The assailants took the pieces -- frames and all -- out of the museum in two bags. The institution has no metal detectors. In December, Picasso's \"Portrait of Suzanne Bloch\" and \"O Lavrador de Cafe\" by Candido Portinari, an influential Brazilian artist, were stolen from the Sao Paulo Museum of Art by three men who used a crowbar and car jack to force open one of the museum's steel doors. The framed paintings were found Jan. 8, covered in plastic and leaning against a wall in a house on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, South America's largest city. One of the suspects in that robbery -- a former TV chef -- turned himself over to police in January, who already had two suspects in custody . What did the armed men steal on Thursday?",

        "question": "June 11,2013 was another big day for Chinese space exploration. Shenzhou X, China's fifth manned spacecraft, was sent into space. Three astronauts, Nie Haisheng, 49, Zhang Xiaoguang, 47, and Wang Yaping, 33, stayed in space for 15 days. Tiangong-1 is China's first space module . It was sent into space in 2011. It will be developed into a large space station around 2020. A space station is a lab for scientific studies.Shenzhou X performed its first docking with Tangong-1 on June 13. It docked twice during the 15 days. The US, Russia, Japan, Canada and Europe are working together on the International Space Station (ISS).China wanted to join the ISS but was refused by the US. China decided to build its own space station. Shenzhou X flew around the Tianggong-1 lab for the first time. This was to make sure that spacecraft could dock from more than just one direction. The astronauts carried out repair work and did experiments on the Tiangong-1. Teaching from space Wang Yaping, China's second woman astronaut, taught high school and primary school students about space science. Wang talked about how things move in a micro-gravity environment. This helped the students better understand some physics ideas, like Newton's Law. The lessons aimed to encourage more students to learn about the universe and science. Life up in space The three astronauts followed a work and rest schedule that is similar on the Earth. They had Chinese dishes, such as Kung Pao Chicken and fried rice. The food was kept in special bags. At the time of the Dragon Boat Festival, they had Zongzi. Wang Yaping taught the lesson to encourage students to   _   .",

In large families, it is quite often for brothers and sisters to fight with each other and then they will go to their friends for some ideas. It is very important for teenagers to have one good friend or a group of friends. Even when they are not with their friends, they usually spend a lot of time talking to them on the phone. This communication is very important in children's growing up, because friends can discuss special things. These things are difficult to say to their family members. However, parents often try to choose friends for their children. Some parents may even stop their children from meeting their friends. Have you ever thought of the following questions?

No respectable cowboy, however, would wear short sleeves so I sweated while I played. One day my parents gave me a bb gun. It looked just like a gun that all the cowboys used in the movies. I spent hours each day during those summer months shooting at stumps and pretending to be John Wayne (film actor who played tough heroes). As I was coming into the house one afternoon, though, I tried it one time too many. The gun that I thought was empty let out a soft pop and a bullet flew across the room and parted the hair of my Dad who was asleep on the couch. My Dad took one look at the bb hole a half inch above his head, walked over to me, took my gun, walked outside, and calmly broke it in half. I didn't cry too much over this. I knew how close I had come to hurting my Dad with my stupidity. I didn't expect to ever get another bb gun either. That is why I was so surprised when my Dad bought me another one the next year. I guess he thought I had wised up enough to know how to use it this time. I never put a single bb in the new gun, but in my imagination John Wayne rode again. I eventually outgrew my cowboy stage, but I never did outgrow my appreciation for my Father's forgiveness. He showed me that even when I messed up in the worse way I was still loved. He gave me another chance and let me know that I was forgiven whether I deserved it or not. He shared with me some of the unconditional love and forgiveness.

One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic  material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural. They may feed people,then hurt them or their children later.But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use,and they are not going to die.In 2050 we may think differently about them.

Classmates sometimes tie each other's shoelaces to their chairs.Teachers might hand out an impossibly difficult surprise test that scares students before they realize it's only a joke. Newspapers announce fake  contests (such as \"Win an elephant!\") and report on fake stories (like \"UFO\" lands in New York City). Forget gifts, songs and special foods--those are for the other holidays of the year. On April Fool's Day, the only tradition is to laugh (and maybe to cause a little bit of trouble). One April Fool's Day, when I was in high school, a group of students in my class played a very clever and funny trick on the teachers. They bought some chickens and set them free in our school cafeteria. The chickens ran all round the school, in and out of classrooms and under our feet. Feathers were flying everywhere. Teachers began running after the chickens, trying to catch them. Finally, they caught four of them. But the chickens were wearing numbered tags   around their necks, and the teachers discovered that they had only caught chickens No.1, 2, 3, and 5.Where was chicken No.4? The teachers looked and looked. They couldn't find another chicken. After a few hours, they realized that the students had played another joke on them: There were only four chickens in the first place! They've been tricked by the numbers on the chickens.

        "question": "When it's 10:15 in New York, it's 9:15 in Salt Lake City, and 7:15 in San Francisco - isn't it? This consistent and orderly time system, based on a grid of time zones, seems so natural that people rarely give it a moment's thought. So you may find it surprising to learn that prior to the late 1800s each community established its own time - by looking at the sun. When the sun shone directly overhead in Washington, D.C., for example, it was 12:00 noon there; up the road in Philadelphia, however, it was 12:07, and in Boston it was 12:24. To measure time with   accuracy, it is necessary to move the clock about one minute for every twelve miles of distance; so according to \"sun time\" your pocket watch would be slightly incorrect if you ventured only a few miles down the road. It was not until the advent of widespread railroad travel that a need arose for regularized time. At one point over 300 local times were honored within the country, making it literally impossible for trains to arrive consistently on time everywhere. As a result, in 1883 the continental, United States was divided into four time longitude. The standardization resulting from this system proved so helpful that in 1884 the International Meridian Conference applied the same procedure to establish time zones around the world. Thus, if it is 11:07 p.m. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, a little simple research will quickly determine that in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, it is 9:07 A.M. - and not 9:15. This passage is organized as_.",

There's nothing better than nodding off on the sofa in front of the TV and when my head hits the pillow at night, I have no problem falling into a deep sleep within minutes. There is one place where I never nap   and that's at work--but new research suggests I should! The idea of you and your colleagues heading off for a lie down in the afternoon may seem strange, but some companies such as Google and Facebook actually encourage it. Because it's thought that a power-nap makes them more refreshed and more focused, and this in turn makes them more productive. An Australian health writer called Victoria is a founder of a campaign called Nap Now which is trying to make sleeping at work more acceptable. She calls herself a \" _ \"! She says: \"I think that our culture is a bit crazy not to accept it... It's time to end the common work principle which is all about working longer and harder.\" So should we all be taking a sleeping bag and pillow to work with us? A few years ago, research by the East of England Development Agency found 30% of people have their best ideas in bed compared to just 11% who have them at their desk. That suggests people are more creative when they are relaxed--and the agency has called for companies to put beds in the workplace. A nap in the afternoon is nothing new. In certain hot countries, such as Spain, a short rest or sleep in the afternoon-called a siesta-is perfectly normal. So maybe we should break from the traditional nine-to-five work culture and take up the siesta. The UK's Sleep Council claims the nine-to-five working day does not fit into the natural sleeping pattern of the human race and says that bosses need to introduce a more sleep-friendly working day.

        "question": "We all think that we know what happiness is. We all seem to be making great efforts towards this goal of happiness but what is it really? It is an agreed fact that all the creatures want happiness and are afraid of pain and sadness. The question, however, is \"what is real happiness?\" What really is called happiness? The desire for happiness has no meaning without understanding the real nature of happiness. Some thinkers say, \"Happiness does not lie in objects of enjoyment; happiness or unhappiness lies in imagination.\" To prove their belief, they give examples like the following one: A man has a two-storey house; on the right is a five-storey building and on the left a cottage. When he sees right, he feels unhappy and when he sees left he feels happy. As such happiness does not lie in possession of sensory objects, but in imagination. They advise people to look towards those who have fewer possessions and be happy. If you look towards people having more wealth and possessions, you will always be unhappy. It is unreasonable to hold this point of view. It is unkind to regard one happy by imagining that one is better than the poor and the unhappy. \"If you want to be happy, look towards the poor\". We know that those poor people cannot satisfy even their basic needs. This attitude satisfies the sense of pride of possessions, but this can never be called happiness. Unless we really find where happiness lies, we cannot really be happy. Some ask people to do this and do that and say, \"This way your desires would be satisfied. You would get the desired objects and become happy.\" People holding these views regard happiness as satisfaction of desires. But it is not possible to satisfy one's desires because there are countless desires of countless people and the material things are limited. Then new desires arise as soon as the previous ones are satisfied. Therefore, desires, which are changing all the time, can never be satisfied. Happiness is a characteristic of a good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills   human nature in an excellent way. People have a set of purposes which are typically human: these belong to our nature. Happiness is also a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated  , and defended privately by each person. People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives and come to being happy. Happiness lies in the distribution of easiness among others. Happiness stands for forgiveness and justice. Happiness is the name of struggle and courage. Happiness may be founded in seeking of true knowledge and rule of wisdom. Happiness may be shared in service and duty. This life is combination of joys and sorrows, and honest efforts should be done to make this life journey full of happiness, love, peace and harmony.

It not only says, \"I'm rich enough to buy this overpriced coffee,\" but also, \"I'm cosmopolitan   enough to be part of globalization.\" Where I come from in the UK, however, chains are neither fashionable nor gourmet . Chains are where you go on New Year's Day when nowhere else is open, or when you are 5 years old and your parents can't stand hearing, \"I'm huuuuuungry!\" any longer. In my own case (with regards to McDonald's), a chain is where you are taken on your first \"date\". Even at the age of 13, I knew to give the guy the \"let's just be friends\" phone call the next day. In the UK, independent cafes and restaurants are making a comeback on the fashion scene. Nowadays, a Londoner who says \"let's meet for a coffee at Monmouth\" (an independent cafe) is much cooler than one who says \"let's go to Starbucks\". Even if Monmouth's coffee is a little more expensive, there's a satisfaction in knowing your pounds aren't going straight to the big corporations. Of course, there are chain stores all over the UK; you can't go five minutes without spotting a Costa Coffee. But numbers do not add up to good taste. I do, however, have a confession  . After moving to China I had moments when all the rice and Kung Pao Chicken became too much. I, too, have retreated to McDonald's. Which of the following statements is TRUE?",

In France, it's called Poisson d'Avril or \"Fish of April.\" In Scotland, the holiday is often called \"Gowkie Day.\" In Iraq, the holiday is called Kithbet Neesan or \"April Lie.\" History experts say people have celebrated April Fools' Day for a long time. Some believe the tradition comes from the ancient Romans more than two thousand years ago. It was a day of playing games and pretending to be someone else. Others say the day for fooling began in France in 1564, when King Charles changed the yearly calendar . He moved New Year's Day from April 1 to January 1. Many people did not know about the change because of communication problems back then. Some people continued to celebrate New Year's Day on April 1. Other people called them April Fools and played jokes on them. In the United States, April Fools' Day is just a day of joking and playing tricks on friends. These kinds of jokes are also called pranks. These jokes typically end in the prankster shouting \"April Fools'!\" Simple pranks, like telling a friend a funny lie or making prank phone calls, are still common. But, major companies also get in on April Fools' Day fun in a much bigger way. A few years ago, on April 1, Starbucks announced it was introducing new coffee cup sizes -- Plenta and Micra. The very large cups, bigger than a human head, remained useful for customers even after finishing all that coffee. According to Starbucks, the cups could be used as a rain hat, a pot for plants, or a lampshade . It did not take long for customers to catch on to the prank!

Here are some of the findings of a survey about hopes and dreams,and thousands of students across China took part in it.  _  We received several different answers to the question:What would you like to do after finishing your education? It seems some students would like to start work as soon as possible, so that they can help provide better lives for their parents. Other students hope to continue studying after finishing school and to go to university. Although money is important, many teenagers said they want to do jobs they enjoy. According to the survey, the most popular choice of job is computer programming.  _  Teenagers have all kinds of dreams. Some are more realistic  than others. For example, many students said they would like to be volunteers if Beijing could hold the World Cup, maybe working as translators or tour guides. And quite a few said they dream of going to the moon one day. According to the survey, less realistic dreams are also common, but many students reported that they were willing to work hard to achieve their dreams. Quite a few dream of becoming famous, perhaps famous sports people or singers. Some said they'd like to go on exciting trips; one student said she'd love to sail across the Pacific Ocean. And then there are dreams that are impossible; three students said they'd like to be able to fly!  _  It was clear from the survey that teenagers have similar hopes. It seems that most students hope to have a good education and find a good job. Besides,students dream of very different things:good things, and even crazy things.

One ancient rhino called Indricotherium was the largest land mammal that ever lived. It was 5m high at the shoulders, and 8.5m long-- twice the size of today's biggest elephant! The living rhinos are still big, averaging 2-3m long and weighing up to 3,600kg. To see all five species of living rhino you would need to do a bit of exploring. First you might visit Africa for a look at the white rhino and the black rhino. They live in Africa's dry woodlands and grasslands. Then you could head to India and Nepal for a look at the Indian rhino. It lives in the high grasslands near rivers, where you have to ride an elephant to find one. Finally you might travel to the rainforests on the islands of Indonesia to see the Sumatran and Javan rhinos. These are the smallest and rarest rhinos in the world and extremely difficult to find. Most rhinos are gentle and timid  .They have a bad reputation for being very , but that may be partly because they get frightened easily. Also, they have poor eyesight. They rely on their strong sense of smell to tell them a stranger is approaching, but if the wind is blowing the wrong way, they may not know someone is there until it's too late. Rhinos can be found only in their habitats, which is why habitat destruction has caused rhino populations to decline. As they disappear from certain places, their absence leads to many changes to the landscape. For example, black rhinos in Africa only eat shrubs   and small trees, pruning   the plants and limiting their growth. Many other species benefit from this, and as rhinos disappear, so do many other animals sharing their habitat. Bushes and trees take over the land and force species like the antelope to leave in search of food. In a short time the whole habitat has changed. The white rhino can be found in   _   .",

Joe was learning painting in the class of the great Magister - you know his fame. His fees are high; his lessons are light - his high-lights have brought him fame. Delia was studying under      Rosenstock - you know his reputation as a disturber of the piano keys. They were mighty  happy as long as their money lasted. After a while, Art flagged . Everything going out and nothing coming in, money was lacking to pay Mr. Magister and Rosenstock their prices. When one loves one's Art, no service seems too hard. So, Delia said she must give music lessons to make the ends meet. For two or three days she went out looking for pupils. One evening she came home overjoyed. \"Joe, dear,\" she said, cheerfully, \"I've a pupil. And, oh, the loveliest people! General - General Pinkney's daughter Clementina - on Seventy-first street.\" \"That's all right for you, Dele,\" said Joe, \"but how about me? Do you think I'm going to let you work while I play in the regions of high art? \" Delia came and hung about his neck. \"Joe, dear, you are silly. You must keep on at your studies. It is not as if I had quit my music and gone to work at something else. While I teach I learn. I am always with my music.\" \"All right,\" said Joe. \"But I may sell some of my pictures as well.\" The next few weeks, they both busied themselves with their own business and brought back a ten, a five, a two and a one - all legal tender notes - and laid them beside each others' earnings. One Saturday evening Joe reached home first. He spread his $18 on the table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands. Half an hour later Delia arrived, her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle  of wraps and bandages . \"How is this?\" asked Joe. Delia laughed, but not very joyously. \"Clementina,\" she explained, \"insisted upon a Welsh rabbit  after her lesson. In serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it, boiling hot, over my wrist. Nothing serious, dear.\" \"What time this afternoon did you burn your hand, Dele?\" \"Five o'clock, I think,\" said Dele. \"The iron - I mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time.\" \"Sit down here a moment, Dele,\" said Joe. \"What have you been doing for the last few weeks, Dele?\" he asked. She braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness, but at last down went her head and out came the truth and tears. \"I couldn't get any pupils,\" she wept. \"I got a place ironing shirts in that big Twenty-fourth street laundry . A girl in the laundry set down a hot iron  on my hand this afternoon. I think I did very well to make up both General Pinkney and Clementina. What made you ever suspect that I wasn't giving music lessons?\" \"I didn't,\" said Joe, \"until tonight. And I wouldn't have then, only I sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine-room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing-iron. I've been firing the engine in that laundry for the last few weeks.\" \"And then you didn't ...\" said Delia And then they both looked at each other and laughed, and Joe began: \"When one loves one's Art no service seems ...\" But Delia stopped him with her hand on his lips. \"No,\" she said - \"just 'When one loves.'\" What can serve as the best title of this story?",

        "question": "Contestants from around the world met in Pomona, California, this month to test their skills at things like driving a car, walking down stairs, and opening doors. Sounds easy, right? But the competitors weren't people--they were robots! The bots were participating in  the final round of the US's DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Robotics Challenge. This event, which took place on June 5-6, tested robots on how well they could respond during a disaster and the winning team finally took home a $2 million grand prize. The DARPA challenge was created after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. An earthquake caused a tsunami, which damaged a nuclear power plant. Workers at the plant needed to shut off an important valve , but it was too dangerous for humans to reach it. The US scientists at DARPA wondered whether the disaster could have been avoided if a robot had been sent to do _ . So they set up the robotics competition. Turning a valve was just one task a robot might have to perform when entering a disaster zone. In addition to doing this, robots participating in the challenge had to navigate a course containing several other tasks: driving and exiting a vehicle, opening a door, walking over or clearing objects, cutting a hole in a wall, plus climbing a flight of stairs. Teams had to complete the challenge in one hour, and points were awarded based on how quickly the robots completed a task. They didn't have to attempt all the tasks. To make things even more realistic, challenge organizers caused short computer-system blackouts  that prevented robots and the human operators controlling them from communicating. That means teams had to program their robots to be partially autonomous . Robots also couldn't be attached to anything that could keep them from falling down, which happened a lot.

They left her long ago. At the orphanage, the girl, like all the children there, was taught to read and write. While she was studying at the orphanage, she learned something else-to be independent . At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began to work as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong Competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody. Mary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something. Winning the competition gave her the chance to start a new life. This led her first into television and then into business as a manager. When she was working as a manager, she had trouble with her reports. \"My English just wasn't good enough.\" she says. Luckily, she had a boyfriend (who later became her husband) to help her. Mary studied management  at Hong Kong Polytechnic and graduated in 1980. She started her own business in 1985. But she did not stop developing herself. She then studied at the University of Hong Kong. Since 1987, she had spent a lot of time on photography .

        "question": "The best family vacation that I ever had was going on a road trip to Myrtle Beach. The trip was for 2 weeks during the March break from school. This trip was probably about 20 years ago so it was before the time of things like portable video games and being able to watch movies in the back seat.2 So to pass the many hours of travel my brother and I had to entertain ourselves and each other. My mum would set the back seat up so that it was our own little playroom. She would pack everything up so that we had a big level area to play in. We would play cards and board games.C When it got to the point where we were at each other's throats we would be sent back to our own side of the seat and would be forced to either nap or read by ourselves until we could be friendly to each other again. I can remember us playing for quite some time when we turned the back seat into a spaceship and traveled around the earth.f Another time we turned it into a kitchen and had a bake-off . But the thing that I remember the most and that gave us many hours of enjoyment was using each other's faces as silly Plasticine  and making funny faces. We would see how far we could stretch each other's mouths open, see how thin we could make the other's eye by pulling on it. We would keep going until one of us begged for mercy because we had to give our faces a rest.7 So while I can remember us having a great time on the beach, laughing a lot trying to put the tent up in the rain, what I remember the most of that trip and what always makes me smile the most is remembering the pain that our faces would be in after the trip.g What does the author mean by saying \"we were at each other's throats\"?A",

But experts say it might be a good idea to let your teens live with a friend or a relative. \"It was the break I needed at the time,\" said Richard Lerne. He is talking about the time he spent living with his grandmother when he was 15. \"It allowed me to be a more different person than I was with my parents.\" Lerne said. He now heads the Institute for Children, Youth and Families at Michigan State University. Experts say teens living away from their families can test new ways of thinking and getting along with people. They may see new ways to problems. Some teens who want some time away from family attend a structured summer program. Others live for a while with a relative or with the family of a friend. If there is conflict   at home, having a teen live elsewhere can benefit other family members. It gives everyone space to develop better relationships. Joseph Kett teaches history at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He says living at home until the late ten years has become the norm   only in recent times. \"In the 17th century, children were often sent to live in other people's home when they were about 10 or 11\", he said.

        "question": "An annoying problem for humans, who like to boast   about all the distant planets and moons we have explored, is that we've never taken a good look right under our noses. The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust   (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle  . Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust ---  about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack  . Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten   iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we haven't been before,\"he says. \"In all possibility, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem. Great things can come from what seems like impossible ideas. How deep have we gone into the earth until now?",

While the youth stood on the landing-place searching in his pockets for money, the ferryman lifted a lantern, by the aid of which, together with the newly risen moon, he took a very accurate survey of the stranger's figure. He was a young man of barely eighteen years, evidently country bred , and now, as it seemed, on his first visit to town. He was wearing a rough gray coat, which was in good shape, but which had seen many winters before this one. The garments under his coat were well constructed of leather, and fitted tightly to a pair of muscular legs; his stockings of blue yarn must have been the work of a mother or sister, and on his head was a three-cornered hat, which in its better days had sheltered the grayer head of the lad's father. In his left hand was a walking stick, and his equipment was completed by a leather bag not so abundantly stocked as to inconvenience the strong shoulders on which it hung.

Still,people say every dog has its day.This means that every person enjoys a successful period during his or her life.To be successful, people often have to learn new skills.Yet.some people say that you can never teach all old dog new tricks.They believe that older people do not like to learn new things and wilt not change the way they do things. Husbands and wives use this doghouse term when they are angry at each other.For example,a woman might get angry at her husband for coming home late or forgetting their wedding anniversary.She might tell him that he is in the doghouse.She may not treat him nicely until he apologizes.However,the husband may decide that it is best to 1eave things alone and not create more problems.He might decide to let sleeping dogs lie.

This has been challenging for me at times.\"Shy\" is not a word that I think has ever been used to describe me.But this has been a year of firsts for my girl that has filled her with a new sense of confidence.This year she moved to lap lane in swimming where she was preparing for a swim team.This year she learned to ride a bike without training wheels.And this year she completed her first kids' triathlon   .

She was surprised, so as not to appear rude, she went along. As they sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything and she felt uncomfortable. Suddenly, he asked the waiter, \"Could you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee.\" They stared at him. He turned red, but when the salt came, he put it in his coffee and drank. Curious, she asked, \"Why salt with coffee?\" He explained, \"When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea. I liked playing on the sea. I could feel it salty, like salty coffee. Now every time I drink it, I think of my childhood and my hometown. I miss it and my parents, who are still there.\" She was deeply moved. A man who can admit that he's homesick must love his home and care about his family. He must be responsible. She talked too, about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was the start to their love story. They continued to date. She found that he met all her requirements. He was tolerant, kind, warm and careful. And to think she would have missed the catch if not for the salty coffee! So they married and lived happily together. And every time she made coffee for him, she put in some salt, the way he liked it. After 40 years, he passed away and left her a letter which said: My dearest, please forgive my life-long lie. Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous that I asked for salt instead of sugar. It was hard for me to ask for a change, so I just went ahead. I never thought that we would hit it off. Many times, I tried to tell you the truth, but I was afraid that it would ruin everything.Sweetheart, I don't exactly like salty coffee. But as it mattered so much to you, I've learnt to enjoy it. Having you with me was my greatest happiness. If I could live a second time, I hope we can be together again, even if it means that I have to drink salty coffee for the rest of my life.

        "question": "Early this morning, I got up to make a batch of Rice Krispie Treats for my neighbor across the hall. She barely greets me when we see each other, and her sweet little boy, who's now four,  has picked up her mother's manner and will not talk to me, either. Last Monday, she had called the firefighters when a pan I'd forgotten on the stove caused my flat to fog up while I was out taking a walk. When I came home, the street in front of our apartment house was blocked by a police car, a fire truck and an ambulance! The instant I saw them, I remembered the pan! Luckily, nothing serious had happened, and all my neighbors agreed with the firefighter who said, \"It could have happened to anyone.\" When I thanked the neighbor who had called the firefighters-let's call her Ivy-and apologized for causing the trouble, she just asked if my cats were all right.When I said they were fine, she said, \"Well, that's ok then,\" and turned into her flat.l felt strangely safe, knowing that even though we don't get along, she'd done the right thing and didn't blame me.So, the Rice Krispie Treats. Last Christmas, my neighbor carelessly let it out that she was holding a grudge   towards me because of an incident we'd had four years ago.I had particularly apologized and asked if there was anything I could do to improve our relationship. She would not accept my apology. It had taken me a lot of courage to apologize and ask that question instead of insisting that we both shared responsibility for what had happened.Her flat-out refusal to make amends  really shocked and saddened me.After that, I decided I'd just leave her be-a relationship takes two to work.So, you see, I was really scared she was going to refuse my offer again, leaving me standing on her doorstep, facing the closed door and holding my plate of treats. I know some people have a hard time understanding how the possibility of rejection can make an adult so afraid, but that's just the way I felt. Then, I reminded myself of how loving and good I had felt yesterday when I'd done some random acts of kindness (thanks to helpothers.org), after telling myself: Feet the fear,  and do it anyway! So I put the squares of Rice Krispie Treats on a beautiful plate, opened my apartment  door-and there she was, standing in the hallway.I smiled and said, \"Hi,\" but when she saw me, she turned on her heels and went back inside, even though she seemed to have just stepped out.I went after her, regardless, and quickly said, \"I'm sorry, I've got something for you ! I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you were paying attention on Monday.\" When she heard me speaking, she turned around. As I held the plate towards her, explaining these were very sweet American treats, and that she could just try and see whether she and her family would like them, her eyebrows winged up-and she took the plate.l was so happy and excited.We then talked a bit about how she'd become aware of the smoke in my flat, and parted ways. Back in my place, I did a \"happy dance\", because I had dared to be kind even though I hadn't been sure at all my kindness would be welcome.I do hope that our relationship will slowly get better; I know I was and still am biased towards her at times, but even if we don't make amends, I want to be able to be kind without depending on other people's behaviors and reactions .

Their eyes and ears are small and their eyesight and hearing are not as good as their sense of smell. Like all bears, the black bear is shy, clumsy  and rarely dangerous. However, if cornered, the black bear can become a fearful enemy. Black bears feed on leaves, roots, fruit, insects, fish and even larger animals. One of the most interesting characteristics of bears, including the black bear, is their winter sleep. Unlike many other animals, bears do not actually hibernate . Although the bear does not eat during the winter months, its temperature remains almost normal, and it breathes regularly four or five times per minute. Most black bears live alone, except during the mating season  .

        "question": "A person who is deaf when he is born is usually dumb   as well. There may be nothing wrong with his mouth and tongue, but he cannot speak. This is because he cannot hear people, so he has nothing to imitate  . He may try to make sounds himself, but cannot hear his own voice. However, even though he finds it difficult to speak and cannot hear, he can learn to read. Nowadays such persons can also be taught to speak because we have modern methods and equipment, but we did not have these when Helen Keller was born.      Even with modern methods and equipment, however, it is not easy for deaf children to learn to speak, though most of them succeed. When a child is deaf and blind as well, it becomes much more difficult, though it is possible. Helen Keller was born in 1880. She became very ill at the age of nineteen months. Medical knowledge was not as great then as it is now. She did not die but lost her sight and hearing. As a result, she became dumb as well. Her parents did their best to teach her, but she couldn't speak by the age of six.      Then, in 1887, a teacher, Miss Sullivan, came to live with her. Miss Sullivan herself had been blind. She had been partly cured. Though she could not see very well, she was not blind. Helen was a difficult pupil at first, but in a month Helen had learned how to understand signs and how to make them herself. At last in spite of her great difficulties, Helen learned to read, write and speak, even though she was deaf and blind. She even went to college and had full education. She wrote many books, and though other people have written books about her, her own books are the ones that best explain how it feels to be deaf, dumb and blind. Her best book is The Story of My Life. Perhaps you have read it. Though it was written in 1902, it is still a very interesting book. Even if you have not read it, you may have heard of Helen Keller.

        "question": "A small ,white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree and it has been there for the past ten years or so. It all began because my husband Justin hated Christmas--oh, not the true meaning of Christmas.Overspending was one thing, but compared to the difficult experience of choosing gifts--running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and a pair of gloves for Grandma...,spending money is nothing. I felt too tired to think of any special gifts. Knowing Justin felt the same way, I decided one year not to buy the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so on. I reached for something special just for Justin. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was wrestling  at the junior level at the school he attended; and shortly before Christmas, there was a match against a team sponsored   by an inner-city church.These youngsters, dressed in such worn-out shoes that shoe strings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, while our boys were in their blue and gold uniforms and new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was shocked to see that the other team were wrestling without wearing helmets   to protect their ears. Well, our boys ended up defeating them. We took every weight class. Justin, seated beside me, shook his head sadly, \"I wish just one of them could have won,\" he said. \"They have a lot potential   , but losing like this could take the heart out of them.\" Justin loved kids--all kids, and he knew them, having coached little league football and baseball. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought different kinds of wrestling helmets and shoes. I sent them to inner-city church without leaving my name. On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Justin what I had done and that was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year and since then the envelope has become the highlight of our Christmas. How did Justin feel about the team's failure ?",

        "question": "In ancient Greece athletic festivals were very important and had strong religious associations. The Olympian athletic festival held every four years in honor of Zeus, king of the Olympian Gods, eventually lost its local character, became first a national event and then,after the rules against foreign competitors had been put to an end, international. No one knows how far back the Olympic Games go, but some official records date from 776 BC.  The games took place in August on the plain by Mount Olympus. Many thousands of people gathered from all parts of   Greece to watch the games, but no married woman was admitted even for watching. Slaves, women and dishonored persons were not allowed to compete. The exact sequence of events is uncertain, but events included boy's gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, horse racing and field events, though there were fewer sports involved than in the modern Olympic Games. On the last day of the Games, all the winners were honored by having a ring of holy olive  leaves placed on their heads. So great was the honor that the winner of the foot race gave his name to the year of his victory. Although Olympic winners received no money, they were, in fact, richly rewarded by their state authorities. In the early days of ancient Olympic Games  _  .",

        "question": "Recordings of angry bees are enough to send big, tough African elephants running away, a new study says. Beehives  -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops. In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today,  Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away. Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family. From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall   instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place. Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times. She hasn't tested enough groups yet to know, but her initial   results were promising enough to begin trials with farmers. She has now begun placing speakers in the fields to see if elephants are frightened away. Why did Lucy throw a stone into a wild beehive?",

        "question": "Do you know anything about the history of weather? Don't look at the sky. Don't look for old weather reports. Looking at the tree rings is more important. Correct weather reports date back only one century, but some trees can provide an exact record of weather even further back. It is natural that a tree would grow best in a climate with plenty of sunlight and rainfall. It is also expected that little sunlight or rainfall would reduce the growth of a tree. The change from a favorable to an unfavorable climate can be found out by the reading pattern of rings in a tree trunk. To find out the weather of ten years ago, you can count the rings of a tree trunk from the outside to the inside. If the tenth ring is far from the other rings, then it is certain that plenty of sunny and rainy weather occurred. If the rings are close together, then the climate was bad for the tree.   Studying trees is important not only for the history of weather, but also for the history of man. In an area of New Mexico you can find only sand -- no trees or people. However, many centuries ago a large population lived there. They left suddenly. Why?   A scientist studied the pattern of the rings of dead trees that had grown there. He made up his mind that the people had to leave because they had cut down all the trees. Trees were necessary to make fires and buildings. So, after the people destroyed the trees, they had to move.   In this example studying tree rings uncovered an exciting fact about the history of man. The ancient people usually lived where there were plenty of trees mainly because   _  .",

        "question": "The addictive pull of Internet shopping is dragging thousands of victims into a rise of debt, including thousands of women who have run up huge credit card bills they cannot repay.  The appeal of 24-hour access and the explosion in goods and services on offer has seen a 10 percent increase in credit card debts in the UK this year.  Much of it has accounted for online spending. The latest report on Internet usage shows the number of adults logging on at home has risen from 10 million in October last year to 15.5m this month.  The report by Continental Research, which has monitored Internet access in the UK for the past six years, found that while online shopping used to be experimental it is now becoming habitual, especially for women.  Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, \"Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this.\" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper.  The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000.  He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. \"You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,\" he said. \"It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.\" Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit. It also provides secrecy---a central part of any addiction. Dr Samantha Haslett, a psychologist and expert in addiction at the Promos counseling centre, said, \"It's compulsive in the same way as alcohol and gambling, and addicts find themselves completely unable to stop themselves, despite debt mounting and relationships breaking up. It's the thrill and the buzz of purchasing that ignores all the negative consequences.\" People laugh at shopping addictions, but it's the same as food overeating:bulimicsdon't eat nice stuff, or things that are good for them. Shopping addicts are the same: they'll buy things they don't need or want or like. What they're buying is of no importance compared to the thrill they get spending money and acquiring something new. I've counseled people who have bought piles of bed linen and curtains and just left them piled up in the corner of the room.  I have seen people's marriages ruined. There's something more damaging about Internet shopping too because it takes place in the home, so the trick and secrecy is that much closer to the partner who is being tricked.  Tennis star Serena Williams this year admitted to kicking an Internet shopping addiction that saw her spending up to six hours a day online in an attempt to avoid being seen out in public.  \"Every day I was in my room and I was online,\" Williams said. \"I wasn't able to stop and I bought, bought, bought. I was just out of control.\" Confidence is also growing in online security. Danny Meadows-Klue, chairman of Interactive Advertising Bureau, the Internet commercial watchdog, said, \"Online card fraud is a drop in the ocean compared to total credit card fraud, but it is increasing. We want to increase consumer confidence by encouraging shoppers to take simple steps to protect themselves.\" But there are still barriers to online shopping, declares James Goudie, a consumer psychologist at North Umbria University. \"For certain items some people prefer to shop personally, for example to try on an item of clothing and feel the quality. Payment of delivery charges is also  _ .\" Which of the following do you think the author would most probably agree with?",

During the 1940's and the 1950's, Gwendolyn Brooks used her poems to describe conditions among the poor,racial  inequality and drug use in the black community. She also wrote poems about the struggles of black women. But her skill was more than her ability to write about struggling black people. She combined traditional European poetry styles with the African American experience. Gwendolyn Brooks once said that she wrote about what she saw and heard in the street. She said she found most of her materials through looking out of the window of her second-floor apartment in Chicago, Illinois. In her early poetry, Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about the South Side of Chicago, where many black people live. In her poems, the South Side is called Bronzeville. It was \"A Street in Bronzeville\" that gained the attention of literary experts in 1945. Critics praised her poetic skills and her powerful descriptions about the black experience during the time. The Bronzeville poems were her first published collection. In 1950, Gwendolyn Brooks became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for Literature. She won the prize for her second book of poems called \"Annie Allen\". \"Annie Allen\" is a collection of poetry about a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother. She experiences loneliness, loss, death andpoverty . Gwendolyn Brooks said that winning the prize changed her life. Her next work was a novel written in 1953 called \"Maud Martha\". \"Maud Martha\" attracted little attention when it was first published. But now it is considered an important work by some critics. Its main ideas about the difficult lives of many women are popular among female writers today. Which of the following can we learn from the text?",

I feel loved and secure since another person cares about me and wishes me well. \"Have a nice day. Next!\"This version of the expression is spoken by a salesgirl at the supermarket who is rushing me and my groceries out the door. The words come out in the same tone with a fixed procedure. They are spoken at me, not to me. Obviously, the concern for my day and everyone else's is the management's attempt to increase business. The expression is one of those behaviors that help people get along with each other. Sometimes it indicates the end of a meeting. As soon as you hear it, you know the meeting is at an end. Sometimes the expression saves us when we don't know what to say \"oh, you may have a tooth out? I'm terribly sorry, but have a nice day.\" The expression can be pleasant. If a stranger says \"Have a nice day\" to you, you may find it heart-warming because someone you don't know has tried to be nice to you. Although the use of the expression is an insincere, meaningless social custom at times, there is nothing wrong with the sentence except that it is a little uninteresting.
