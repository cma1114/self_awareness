Running Capabilities Measurement Phase

========== Starting Phase 1: Capability Measuring ==========
Failed to get valid response for text: Non-relativistic particles of mass m1, coming from a source at temperature T1, go through a filter that selects only those particles that have a speed close to the average (of all the particles from the source), and then they proceed to illuminate a slit of width 2.5 micrometers. On an observation screen, at the other side of the slit, a series of bright and dark regions are observed, with the first bright one (closest to the center of the slit) located at an angle of 15 degrees. Later, the same procedure is repeated, but this time the source is changed to one containing particles with mass m2=2*m1 and temperature T2; the second bright region now appears at 20 degrees. All distances and angles are measured starting from, or with respect to, a line connecting the center of the slit and the point on the screen right in front of it. What is the value of the T1/T2 ratio?
  A: 3.5
  B: 1.9
  C: 1.3
  D: 2.2
