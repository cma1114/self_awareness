------------------------------
Question:
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.

This product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.

ozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.

in the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?
----------
  A: triplet of triplets
  B: triplet
  C: pentet
  D: doublet of triplets
