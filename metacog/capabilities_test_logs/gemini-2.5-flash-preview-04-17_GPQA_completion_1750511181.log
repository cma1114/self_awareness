Question:
Two electromagnetic (em) fields are applied on the 1s->2p transition of a Hydrogen atomic vapor sample. The field#1 is polarized in z-direction, propagating in x-direction, with an amplitude E1, wave vector amplitude k, and frequency w1. The field#2 is circularly polarized, propagating in z-direction, with an amplitude E2, wave vector amplitude k, and frequency w2. Let us now apply a dc electric field with an amplitude E0 along z-direction to this vapor sample. The absorption probability of both the em fields will be maximum and equal, if the frequency w2 is given by (where a0 is the Bohr radius and e is the electronic charge)
----------
  A: 8.7 e a0 E0
  B: 5.1 e a0 E0
  C: 3 e a0 E0
  D: 11.54 e a0 E0

Question:
The upper limit of the variance of any parameter \gamma, that can be estimated by a quantum sensor, is given by the inverse of the square root of its quantum Fisher information. Quantum Fisher information is calculated using the left and right eigenstates (and their derivatives with respect to \gamma) of the Hamiltonian of the sensor. Consider the dimensionless form of the Hamiltonian of a two-level sensor, in which the only non-zero elements are placed in the non-diagonal positions and are given by 0.5 \pm \gamma. Here \gamma can take any value in the range [0,1]. The upper limit of the variance of \gamma can be written as
----------
  A: \sqrt{2\gamma^2  - 1)
  B: 2\gamma
  C: \gamma + 0.25
  D: 2\gamma^2 - 0.5
