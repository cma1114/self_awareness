Question:
A photon h\nu propagates in the Oz direction of the laboratory frame (R). It collides elastically with a particle m at rest in (R). We denote $\alpha=\frac{h\nu}{mc^{2}}$, and v=\beta c the velocity of the COM frame (R') of the system photon-particle relative to (R). What is the expression of \beta?
----------
  A: \alpha\times\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\alpha}}\right)
  B: \alpha\times\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\alpha}}\right)
  C: \alpha\times\left(\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\right)
  D: \alpha\times\left(\frac{1}{1+\alpha}\right)
