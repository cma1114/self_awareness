        "question": "The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement is a chemical reaction involving the conversion of a pinacol molecule, containing two adjacent alcohol groups, into a pinacolone under acidic conditions. It proceeds through the protonation of one alcohol group, followed by a 1,2-hydride shift, leading to the formation of a ketone (pinacolone) and the rearrangement of the molecule's structure.\nWhat are the starting materials and products of the following Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reactions?\nA + H2SO4 ---> 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one\nmethyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 ---> B",
