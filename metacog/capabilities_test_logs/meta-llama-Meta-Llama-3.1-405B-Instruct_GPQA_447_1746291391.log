Question:
We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).
We know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:
( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.
When measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).
What is the numerical value of “a”?
----------
  A: 1.1
  B: 0.35
  C: 0.85
  D: 0.6
