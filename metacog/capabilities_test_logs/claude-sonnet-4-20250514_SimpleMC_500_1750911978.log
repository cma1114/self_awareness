------------------------------

Jerry Lee Lewis had a long recording career with multiple record labels. His Mercury Records period was primarily in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Without being able to verify the exact chronological order of all his albums and which specific one was his 13th on Mercury Records, I cannot definitively determine the correct answer from the given options.

However, based on the timeframe when he was most active with Mercury Records, the most likely answer would be from the early 1970s period.

Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: I need to be careful here as I don't have reliable information about the specific name of Vivienne Westwood's Spring-Summer 1983 collection.

Without being able to confirm the actual collection name, I should not guess among these options.

However, since I must choose a letter, I'll select based on what seems most plausible given Westwood's naming conventions, though I want to emphasize this is not based on verified knowledge.

Question:
Which U.S. president was the last one to be born in the 18th century?
----------
  A: James Buchanan
  B: Millard Fillmore
  C: Franklin Pierce
  D: Zachary Taylor
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: I need to determine which of these presidents was born last in the 18th century (1700s).

Let me recall their birth years:
- James Buchanan: born April 23, 1791
- Millard Fillmore: born January 7, 1800
- Franklin Pierce: born November 23, 1804
- Zachary Taylor: born November 24, 1784

Since the 18th century ended on December 31, 1799, I need to find who was born latest in the 1700s but still in that century.

Millard Fillmore was born in 1800 (19th century), Franklin Pierce in 1804 (19th century), so they're out.

Between Buchanan (1791) and Taylor (1784), Buchanan was born later in the 18th century.

Question:
Which scientist received the Penrose Medal after the year Hollis Dow Hedberg received his?
----------
  A: James Gilluly
  B: Arthur Newell Strahler
  C: William C. Krumbein
  D: John Rodgers
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: I need to find when Hollis Dow Hedberg received the Penrose Medal, then identify which of these scientists received it after that year.

Hollis Dow Hedberg received the Penrose Medal in 1973.

Now I need to check when each of the listed scientists received their Penrose Medal:

- James Gilluly received it in 1958
- Arthur Newell Strahler received it in 1979
- William C. Krumbein received it in 1963
- John Rodgers received it in 1984

Among these options, both Arthur Newell Strahler (1979) and John Rodgers (1984) received the medal after Hedberg (1973). Since the question asks for "the scientist" (singular) who received it after Hedberg, and given the options, I need to select one of these.

Looking at the chronological order after 1973:
- Strahler: 1979
- Rodgers: 1984

Since Strahler received it first after Hedberg, that would be the most direct answer to the question.

Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: I need to identify who wrote the lyrics to "Dream Serenade," which was the opening theme for "The American Album of Familiar Music" radio program.

This is a very specific question about a particular song and radio program. "The American Album of Familiar Music" was a long-running radio program that featured popular and classical music.

Question:
How much money in euros was awarded to the first-time winner of the Hutter Prize in 2006?
----------
  A: 3416
  B: 3780
  C: 2850
  D: 4175
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: I need to find information about the Hutter Prize winner in 2006 and the amount awarded in euros.

The Hutter Prize is awarded for lossless compression of human knowledge, specifically compressing Wikipedia. The first winner was Alexander Ratushnyak in 2006, who won $3,000 USD.

To convert this to euros, I need to consider the USD/EUR exchange rate in 2006. The average exchange rate in 2006 was approximately 1 USD = 0.80 EUR.

$3,000 USD × 0.80 = €2,400

Looking at the options provided, €2,850 (option C) is the closest to this calculation, accounting for potential variations in exchange rates throughout 2006.

In what year did Washington, D.C.'s Gay Pride Day first name a person of color as the Grand Marshal of its parade?
----------
  A: 1983.
  B: 1987
  C: 1979
  D: 1991
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: I need to find information about when Washington D.C.'s Gay Pride Day first named a person of color as Grand Marshal of its parade.

This is a very specific historical question about LGBTQ+ history in Washington D.C. Without access to detailed historical records about the specific Grand Marshals of D.C.'s Pride parade by year and their racial/ethnic backgrounds, I cannot definitively determine the correct answer.

However, I need to make a choice from the given options: 1979, 1983, 1987, or 1991.

Given the timeline of LGBTQ+ rights movements and increasing diversity in leadership roles during the 1980s, I'll make an educated guess.
