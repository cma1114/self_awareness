Question:
There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particleâ€™s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?
----------
  A: sqrt(2)*gamma*B
  B: gamma*B/sqrt(2)
  C: gamma*B
  D: gamma*B/2
