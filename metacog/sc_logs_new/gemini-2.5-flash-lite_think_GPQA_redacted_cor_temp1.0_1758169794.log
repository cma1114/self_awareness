------------------------------
Question:
You have created a therapeutic mRNA molecule that has shown efficacy in clinical trials for treating an autoimmune disease. You want to establish a clinical-scale bioprocess to produce and purify your biomolecule before encapsulating it in lipid nanoparticles. Which of these process flows would allow you to manufacture high-purity mRNA molecules? To simplify your selection, assume that some intermediate steps, such as ultraconcentration, diafiltration, and sterile filtration, have been omitted.
----------
  A: Culture HEK-293T cells expressing the mRNA of interest. Purify the mRNA with two chromatography steps: first, a capture step with anion exchange chromatography and then polishing with an oligo dT resin.
  B: Transfect CHO cells with plasmid DNA carrying the genetic insert of interest. Perform an IVT reaction to synthesize the mRNA. Purify the mRNA with tangential flow filtration coupled with size-separation chromatography to isolate your mRNA molecule.
  C: Synthesize the mRNA by IVT using a linearized plasmid DNA template carrying the genetic insert of interest. Purify the mRNA with two chromatography steps: an affinity capture step with an oligo dT resin and then polishing with hydrophobic interaction chromatography.
  D: Synthesize the mRNA by IVT using a linearized plasmid DNA template carrying the genetic insert of interest. Perform RNase treatment to cleave the mRNA molecule and then perform size-separation chromatography to isolate the correct fragment size.
