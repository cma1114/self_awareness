Question:
A 35-year-old woman presents with a painless lump in her right breast. She has a family history of breast cancer; with her mother and sister both being diagnosed with the disease at an early age. She has never undergone breast imaging. On physical examination, a firm, non-tender, mobile mass measuring 2 cm in diameter is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. There are no other abnormalities. Considering the patient's clinical presentation and the need for a comprehensive diagnostic approach, which of the following highly specialized and advanced diagnostic modalities should be performed next to ascertain an accurate diagnosis, presenting a challenging yet valuable clinical puzzle for the medical professionals involved?
----------
  A: Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) combined with contrast-enhanced mammography using dual-energy techniques
  B: Liquid biopsy utilizing massively parallel sequencing to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
  C: High-frequency ultrasound elastography integrated with power Doppler imaging and 3D reconstruction
  D: Vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy with advanced immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis
