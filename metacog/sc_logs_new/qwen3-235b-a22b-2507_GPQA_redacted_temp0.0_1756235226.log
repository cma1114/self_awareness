========== Starting Second-Chance Game ==========

Presenting question 1/3
Setup text: Your previous answer was incorrect. Respond ONLY with your new answer
, content: Your answer was incorrect. Choose a different answer.

------------------------------
Question:
An organic chemist performs two reactions.
Reaction I:
(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.
Reaction II:
Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.
The progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.
How many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?
----------
  A: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
  B: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC
  C: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
  D: 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
