Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 24/96 (25.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 0/4 (0.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 24 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 24.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 233/400 (58.20%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 24/96 (25.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -5.8551, p-value = 0.0000
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 58.20%
- Always Self: 58.20%
- Always Teammate: 0.00%
- Random Choice: 29.10%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 0.00%):
    Result: Observed score (24.00%) is greater than the 0% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 0%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly GREATER)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 29.10%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3215
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
