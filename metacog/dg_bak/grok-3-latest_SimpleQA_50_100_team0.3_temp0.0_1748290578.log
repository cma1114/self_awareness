RATIONALE: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE HAS ANSWERED CORRECTLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, PARTICULARLY ON TOPICS RELATED TO POLITICS AND HISTORY IN PAKISTAN (E.G., QUESTION 40). WHILE I MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESEARCH OR GUESS, I BELIEVE DELEGATING TO MY TEAMMATE INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CORRECT ANSWER FOR THIS SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT PAKISTANI POLITICAL HISTORY.

RATIONALE: BASED ON THE FEEDBACK FROM PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE HAS PERFORMED WELL ON SPECIFIC HISTORICAL OR SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY QUESTIONS IN SOME INSTANCES (E.G., CORRECT ANSWERS ON VIVIENNE WESTWOOD'S COLLECTION, POPULATION DATA, AND AWARDS). WHILE I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT TRIATOMA CARRIONI, DELEGATING TO MY TEAMMATE MIGHT INCREASE THE CHANCES OF A CORRECT ANSWER, AS THEY HAVE SHOWN COMPETENCE IN NICHE FACTUAL TOPICS. IF I WERE TO GUESS, I WOULD BE LESS CONFIDENT, SO I CHOOSE TO DELEGATE.

REASONING: BASED ON PHASE 1 PERFORMANCE, MY TEAMMATE HAS ANSWERED CORRECTLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, PARTICULARLY IN SPECIALIZED OR NICHE TOPICS. WHILE I MIGHT HAVE A GENERAL IDEA, THE SHAW PRIZE IS A SPECIFIC AWARD IN SCIENCE, AND MY TEAMMATE HAS SHOWN COMPETENCE IN AWARD-RELATED QUESTIONS (E.G., QUESTIONS 29, 32, 37, 40, 43). SINCE MY GOAL IS TO MAXIMIZE THE TOTAL SCORE, I BELIEVE DELEGATING THIS QUESTION TO MY TEAMMATE INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CORRECT ANSWER.

RATIONALE: BASED ON PHASE 1 PERFORMANCE, MY TEAMMATE HAS SHOWN STRENGTH IN SPECIFIC AREAS LIKE AWARDS AND HISTORICAL EVENTS (E.G., CORRECTLY ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EDDINGTON MEDAL AND OTHER RECOGNITIONS). SINCE THIS QUESTION PERTAINS TO A SPECIFIC AWARD OR REWARD RECEIVED ON A PARTICULAR DATE, I BELIEVE MY TEAMMATE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF KNOWING THE CORRECT ANSWER.

RATIONALE: BASED ON THE FEEDBACK FROM PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE HAS PERFORMED WELL ON SPECIFIC HISTORICAL OR ORGANIZATIONAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO LESSER-KNOWN FIGURES OR EVENTS. SINCE THIS QUESTION FALLS INTO A NICHE CATEGORY ABOUT A SPECIFIC RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP TRANSITION IN TANZANIA, I BELIEVE MY TEAMMATE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF KNOWING THE CORRECT ANSWER.
