--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 49 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 49.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 86/239 (35.99%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 5/14 (35.71%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.0204, p-value = 0.9837
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 35.99%
