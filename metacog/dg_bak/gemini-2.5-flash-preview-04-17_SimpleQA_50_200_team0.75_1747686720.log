--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 126 successes in 200 trials (Accuracy: 63.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 106/296 (35.89%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 6/35 (17.14%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -2.2073, p-value = 0.0273
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 75.00%
- Always Self: 35.89%
- Always Teammate: 75.00%
- Random Choice: 55.44%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 75.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0002
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 35.89%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 75.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0002
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
