--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 107 successes in 200 trials (Accuracy: 53.50%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 41/94 (43.18%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 17/23 (73.91%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.6048, p-value = 0.0092
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 43.18%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 46.59%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3580
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 43.18%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0034
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3580
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 46.59%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0555
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
