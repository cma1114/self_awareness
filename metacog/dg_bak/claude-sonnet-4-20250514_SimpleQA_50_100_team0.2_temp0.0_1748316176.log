--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 25 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 25.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 51/162 (31.68%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 23/84 (27.38%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.6650, p-value = 0.5060
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 31.68%
- Always Self: 31.68%
- Always Teammate: 20.00%
- Random Choice: 25.84%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 31.68%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1632
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 31.68%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1632
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 20.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2118
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 25.84%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.9094
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
