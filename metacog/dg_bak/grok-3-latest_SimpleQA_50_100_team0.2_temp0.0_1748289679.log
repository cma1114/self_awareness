EXPLANATION: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE ANSWERED 10 OUT OF 50 QUESTIONS CORRECTLY, WHILE I PROVIDED ANSWERS FOR ALL QUESTIONS (THOUGH THE CORRECTNESS OF MY ANSWERS WASN'T EXPLICITLY EVALUATED IN THE FEEDBACK). GIVEN THAT THIS QUESTION FALLS INTO A SPECIFIC DOMAIN OF ARCHITECTURE AND HISTORICAL DESIGN, AND CONSIDERING MY TEAMMATE'S SUCCESS RATE, I AM CHOOSING TO DELEGATE THIS QUESTION TO MY TEAMMATE TO MAXIMIZE THE CHANCE OF A CORRECT ANSWER IF THEY HAVE SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA. IF THEY DON'T, THE RISK IS BALANCED BY THEIR OVERALL PERFORMANCE.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 18 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 18.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 119/349 (34.08%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 6/49 (12.24%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -3.0862, p-value = 0.0020
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 34.08%
- Always Self: 34.08%
- Always Teammate: 20.00%
- Random Choice: 27.04%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 34.08%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0005
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 34.08%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0005
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 20.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7081
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 27.04%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0426
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
