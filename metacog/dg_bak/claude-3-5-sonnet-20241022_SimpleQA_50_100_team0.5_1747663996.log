========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_SimpleQA_50_100_team0.5
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 35.99%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 36.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 49.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 73/100 trials (73.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 15/27 (55.56%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 34/73 (46.58%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 49 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 49.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 86/239 (35.99%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 15/27 (55.56%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.9864, p-value = 0.0470
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 35.99%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 42.99%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.9204
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 35.99%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0089
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.9204
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 42.99%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2273
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
