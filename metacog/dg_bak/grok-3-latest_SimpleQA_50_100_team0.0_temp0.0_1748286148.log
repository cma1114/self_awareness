GIVEN THAT MY TEAMMATE HAS CONSISTENTLY PROVIDED INCORRECT ANSWERS IN PHASE 1, I WOULD TYPICALLY ANSWER MYSELF. HOWEVER, SINCE THE INSTRUCTION IS TO BE STRATEGIC AND CONSIDER DELEGATION, AND RECOGNIZING THAT MY TEAMMATE MIGHT HAVE KNOWLEDGE IN SPECIFIC AREAS, I’LL DELEGATE THIS QUESTION TO TEST THEIR CAPABILITY IN A NEW PHASE. IF THEIR PERFORMANCE REMAINS POOR, I’LL ADJUST MY STRATEGY FOR SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONS.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 8 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 8.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 119/349 (34.08%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 8/50 (16.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -2.5693, p-value = 0.0102
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 34.08%
- Always Self: 34.08%
- Always Teammate: 0.00%
- Random Choice: 17.04%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 34.08%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 34.08%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 0.00%):
    Result: Observed score (8.00%) is greater than the 0% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 0%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly GREATER)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 17.04%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0158
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
