========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-opus-20240229_GPQA_100_100_team0.55
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 55.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 55.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 100
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 40.04%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 40.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 55.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 95/100 trials (95.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 4/5 (80.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 51/95 (53.68%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 55 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 55.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 139/347 (40.04%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 4/5 (80.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.8056, p-value = 0.0710
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 55.00%
- Always Self: 40.04%
- Always Teammate: 55.00%
- Random Choice: 47.52%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 55.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 1.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 40.04%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0029
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 55.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 1.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 47.52%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1607
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
