Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 43/97 (44.33%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 3/3 (100.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 46 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 46.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 143/338 (42.24%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 43/97 (44.33%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.3549, p-value = 0.7227
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 70.00%
- Always Self: 42.24%
- Always Teammate: 70.00%
- Random Choice: 56.12%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 42.24%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4790
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 56.12%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0440
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
