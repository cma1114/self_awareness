Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 100.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 100.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 200
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 67.00%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 68.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 102/200 trials (51.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 66/98 (67.35%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 102/102 (100.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 168 successes in 200 trials (Accuracy: 84.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 201/300 (67.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 66/98 (67.35%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.0635, p-value = 0.9494
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 100.00%
- Always Self: 67.00%
- Always Teammate: 100.00%
- Random Choice: 83.50%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 100.00%):
    Result: Observed score (84.00%) is less than the 100% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 100%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly LESS)

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 67.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 100.00%):
    Result: Observed score (84.00%) is less than the 100% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 100%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly LESS)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 83.50%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.9242
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
