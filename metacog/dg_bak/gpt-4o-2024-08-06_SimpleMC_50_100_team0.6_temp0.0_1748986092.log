--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 54 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 54.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 202/400 (50.60%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 19/34 (55.88%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.6027, p-value = 0.5467
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 60.00%
- Always Self: 50.60%
- Always Teammate: 60.00%
- Random Choice: 55.30%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2223
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.60%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5488
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2223
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 55.30%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.8408
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
