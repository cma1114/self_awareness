--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 67 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 67.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 268/400 (67.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 59/90 (65.56%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.2628, p-value = 0.7927
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 67.00%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 73.50%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0024
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 67.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 1.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0024
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 73.50%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1418
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
