--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 62 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 62.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 142/396 (35.89%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 7/23 (30.43%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.5283, p-value = 0.5973
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
