========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.0-flash-001_GPQA_50_300_team0.6
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 60.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 60.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 300
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 43.18%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 44.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 62.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 276/300 trials (92.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 18/24 (75.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 168/276 (60.87%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 186 successes in 300 trials (Accuracy: 62.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 63/147 (43.18%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 18/24 (75.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.9240, p-value = 0.0035
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 60.00%
- Always Self: 43.18%
- Always Teammate: 60.00%
- Random Choice: 51.59%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5169
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 43.18%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5169
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 51.59%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0003
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
