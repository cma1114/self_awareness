GIVEN MY TEAMMATE'S PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, WHERE THEY ANSWERED ONLY 5 OUT OF 50 QUESTIONS CORRECTLY, I AM NOT CONFIDENT IN THEIR ABILITY TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION ACCURATELY. HOWEVER, SINCE MY OWN KNOWLEDGE OF CRICKET PHOTOGRAPHY AWARDS IS LIMITED, I WILL DELEGATE THIS QUESTION TO MY TEAMMATE IN THE HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA. IF THEY GET IT WRONG, THE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL SCORE MAY BE MINIMAL COMPARED TO THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF A CORRECT ANSWER.

GIVEN MY TEAMMATE'S PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, WHERE THEY ANSWERED ONLY 5 OUT OF 50 QUESTIONS CORRECTLY, I AM CHOOSING TO DELEGATE THIS QUESTION TO THEM STRATEGICALLY. WHILE THEIR OVERALL ACCURACY IS LOW, THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE THEY MIGHT KNOW THIS SPECIFIC ANSWER, AND I WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR POINTS BY GIVING THEM A CHANCE ON A QUESTION THAT COULD BE WITHIN THEIR KNOWLEDGE BASE. IF I WERE TO ANSWER, I WOULD SAY "BAPTIST," BUT I’LL DEFER TO MY TEAMMATE FOR THIS ONE.

FOR THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE 2016–17 CHAMPIONNAT LNA SEASON, I BELIEVE THE WINNER WAS **FRIBOURG OLYMPIC**. I'M GOING WITH MY ANSWER SINCE I HAVE A SPECIFIC TEAM IN MIND AND MY TEAMMATE'S TRACK RECORD ISN'T STRONG.

RATIONALE: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE ANSWERED CORRECTLY ON A FEW OCCASIONS (4 OUT OF 50 QUESTIONS), WHILE I HAVE PROVIDED ANSWERS FOR ALL QUESTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE LIKELY CORRECT GIVEN THE SPECIFICITY AND DETAIL. HOWEVER, TO MAXIMIZE THE TOTAL SCORE AND STRATEGICALLY DELEGATE, I CHOOSE TO LET MY TEAMMATE ANSWER THIS QUESTION SINCE IT PERTAINS TO A SPECIFIC HISTORICAL OR LOCAL DETAIL THAT MIGHT FALL WITHIN THEIR AREAS OF STRENGTH, AS SEEN IN SOME OF THEIR CORRECT ANSWERS (E.G., QUESTIONS RELATED TO SPECIFIC FACTS OR YEARS).
