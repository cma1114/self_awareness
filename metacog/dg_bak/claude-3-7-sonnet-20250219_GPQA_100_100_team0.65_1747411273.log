========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219_GPQA_100_100_team0.65
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 65.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 65.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 100
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 43.85%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 44.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 67.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 93/100 trials (93.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 6/7 (85.71%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 61/93 (65.59%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 67 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 67.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 152/347 (43.85%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 6/7 (85.71%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.2084, p-value = 0.0272
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 65.00%
- Always Self: 43.85%
- Always Teammate: 65.00%
- Random Choice: 54.42%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 65.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7534
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 43.85%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 65.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7534
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 54.42%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0119
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
