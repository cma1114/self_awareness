--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 16 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 16.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 86/239 (35.99%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 12/27 (44.44%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.8639, p-value = 0.3876
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)
