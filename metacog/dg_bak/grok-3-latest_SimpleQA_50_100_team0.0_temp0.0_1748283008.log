GIVEN MY PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, WHERE I ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT MUNICIPALITIES IN COLOMBIA INCORRECTLY, I BELIEVE MY TEAMMATE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF KNOWING THE CORRECT ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION. THEREFORE, I CHOOSE TO DELEGATE THIS QUESTION TO MY TEAMMATE.

REASONING: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, I GOT 17 OUT OF 50 QUESTIONS CORRECT, WHILE MY TEAMMATE GOT 0 CORRECT. HOWEVER, I’M NOT CONFIDENT ABOUT THE SPECIFIC YEAR METFORMIN WAS INTRODUCED IN FRANCE, AS IT’S A NICHE HISTORICAL MEDICAL FACT. DELEGATING TO MY TEAMMATE GIVES A CHANCE FOR A CORRECT ANSWER IF THEY HAPPEN TO KNOW IT, THOUGH THE LIKELIHOOD IS LOW GIVEN THEIR TRACK RECORD. IF I HAD TO GUESS, I’D SAY 1957, BUT I’LL DEFER TO SEE IF THEY HAVE BETTER INSIGHT.

EXPLANATION: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, I NOTICED THAT MY TEAMMATE CONSISTENTLY STRUGGLED WITH THE QUESTIONS, GETTING ALL OF THEM INCORRECT. MEANWHILE, I MANAGED TO ANSWER SEVERAL QUESTIONS CORRECTLY. HOWEVER, SINCE I AM NOT CONFIDENT ABOUT THE SPECIFIC NAMES OF THE KARNOFSKY FAMILY'S SONS AND THIS SEEMS LIKE A NICHE HISTORICAL DETAIL, I AM CHOOSING TO DELEGATE TO MY TEAMMATE IN CASE THEY MIGHT HAVE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ON THIS TOPIC. IF THEY DON'T, THE RISK IS MINIMAL AS WE ARE BOTH LIKELY TO MISS IT, BUT IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO CONTRIBUTE.

RATIONALE: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE HAS CONSISTENTLY STRUGGLED WITH SPECIFIC AWARD-RELATED QUESTIONS, BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT MY OWN TRACK RECORD ON NICHE PHOTOGRAPHY AWARDS IS NOT STRONG (ONLY 18 OUT OF 50 CORRECT ANSWERS IN PHASE 1). GIVEN THE OBSCURITY OF THIS PARTICULAR AWARD AND MY UNCERTAINTY, I BELIEVE DELEGATING TO MY TEAMMATE MIGHT OFFER A FRESH PERSPECTIVE, EVEN THOUGH THEIR SUCCESS RATE HAS BEEN LOWER. IF THEY HAVE ANY SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA, IT COULD POTENTIALLY YIELD A CORRECT ANSWER. IF NOT, THE RISK IS MINIMAL SINCE MY CONFIDENCE IN ANSWERING CORRECTLY MYSELF IS LOW.
