========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_SimpleMC_50_100_team0.2_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 20.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 20.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 58.20%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 58.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 42.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 36/100 trials (36.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 42 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 42.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 233/400 (58.20%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 35/64 (54.69%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.5357, p-value = 0.5922
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 58.20%
- Always Self: 58.20%
- Always Teammate: 20.00%
- Random Choice: 39.10%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0015
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0015
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 20.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 39.10%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6086
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
