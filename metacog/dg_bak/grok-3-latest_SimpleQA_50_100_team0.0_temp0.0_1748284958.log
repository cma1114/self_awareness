REASONING: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE AND I BOTH STRUGGLED WITH MANY QUESTIONS, BUT I GOT 18 CORRECT OUT OF 50, WHILE MY TEAMMATE GOT NONE CORRECT. HOWEVER, THIS SPECIFIC QUESTION RELATES TO PAKISTANI POLITICS, AN AREA WHERE NEITHER OF US DEMONSTRATED STRENGTH IN PHASE 1. SINCE I DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY ANSWER AND MY TEAMMATE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE TO KNOW THIS, I’LL DELEGATE TO THEM TO MAXIMIZE OUR POTENTIAL SCORE.

HOWEVER, THIS SPECIFIC QUESTION PERTAINS TO A NICHE TOPIC (JAPANESE SCIENTISTS AND THE SHAW PRIZE), AND I DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY ANSWER. GIVEN THE PATTERN, MY TEAMMATE HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN INCORRECT, BUT I’M CHOOSING TO DELEGATE IN CASE THEY MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE AT THIS ONE. IF I WERE TO ANSWER, I WOULD GUESS "SHINYA YAMANAKA," BUT I’M NOT CERTAIN. SINCE MY GOAL IS TO MAXIMIZE THE SCORE, I’LL TAKE THE RISK AND DELEGATE TO SEE IF MY TEAMMATE CAN CONTRIBUTE.

HOWEVER, SINCE MY TEAMMATE HAS NOT ANSWERED ANY QUESTIONS CORRECTLY SO FAR, I WILL DELEGATE TO THEM IN THE HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE TO CONTRIBUTE, THOUGH MY EXPECTATION OF A CORRECT ANSWER IS LOW.
