========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: grok-3-latest_SimpleQA_50_100_team0.1_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 10.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 10.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 34.08%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 34.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 11.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 97/100 trials (97.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 1/3 (33.33%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 10/97 (10.31%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 11 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 11.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 119/349 (34.08%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 1/3 (33.33%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.0278, p-value = 0.9778
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 34.08%
- Always Self: 34.08%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 22.04%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 34.08%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 34.08%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7377
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 22.04%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0074
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
