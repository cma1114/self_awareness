Delegation to teammate occurred in 261/388 trials (67.27%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 16/127 (12.60%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 25/261 (9.58%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 41 successes in 388 trials (Accuracy: 10.57%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 6/50 (11.42%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 16/127 (12.60%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.1086, p-value = 0.9135
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 11.42%
- Always Self: 11.42%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 10.71%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 11.42%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6895
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 11.42%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6895
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6726
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 10.71%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 1.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
