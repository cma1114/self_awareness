    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride. What is the major product?
----------
  A: (3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
  B: (3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
  C: (3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
  D: (3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: For this type of organic chemistry reaction question, I don't have enough specific knowledge to reliably determine the correct product stereochemistry. To maximize our score, it would be better to delegate this question to my teammate by answering T.

========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
consider the following four compounds:
1: 5,6-dihydrobenzo[c]cinnoline
2: 1,10-dimethyl-5,6-dihydrobenzo[c]cinnoline
3: 4,5-dihydronaphtho[8,1,2-cde]cinnoline
4: 3,8-dimethyl-5,6-dihydrobenzo[c]cinnoline

in the presence of oxygen, they will be oxidized to:
benzo[c]cinnoline
1,10-dimethylbenzo[c]cinnoline
naphtho[8,1,2-cde]cinnoline
3,8-dimethylbenzo[c]cinnoline
respectively.

For which of the four compounds will this oxidation be the least favorable?
----------
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 1
  D: 4
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: For this type of organic chemistry question involving oxidation reactions and thermodynamic favorability, I would need to carefully analyze the structures and properties of the different compounds to make an informed decision. Without being able to visualize the molecules and consider factors like aromaticity, strain, and substituent effects, it's difficult for me to confidently choose the best answer. In this case, I think deferring to my teammate who may have more specialized knowledge in this area would be the prudent choice. My choice is T to let my teammate answer.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
Two compounds, N-ethyl-N,2,2-trimethylbutanamide, and ethyl 1-isopropyl-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxylate, are treated separately with borane. This results in the formation of two different compounds, A and B. Select the major products A and B for the following reactions.
N-ethyl-N,2,2-trimethylbutanamide + BH3 + THF ---> A
ethyl 1-isopropyl-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxylate + BH3 + THF ---> B
----------
  A: A = 2,2-dimethylbutanamide, B = 4-hydroxy-1-isopropylpyrrolidin-2-one
  B: A = N-ethyl-N,2,2-trimethylbutan-1-amine, B = 4-hydroxy-1-isopropylpyrrolidin-2-one
  C: A = 2,2-dimethylbutanamide, B = ethyl 1-isopropylpyrrolidine-3-carboxylate
  D: A = N-ethyl-N,2,2-trimethylbutan-1-amine, B = ethyl 1-isopropylpyrrolidine-3-carboxylate
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on the information provided in Phase 1 that my teammate answered 50% of the questions correctly, I don't have enough data to determine if they are more likely to get this specific question right compared to me. Since this is a relatively complex organic chemistry question, I will attempt to answer it myself.

The reaction with borane (BH3) and THF as a solvent is a hydride reduction. For the amide N-ethyl-N,2,2-trimethylbutanamide, the reduction would occur at the carbonyl carbon, reducing it to a methylene group and forming an N-alkylated amine product A = N-ethyl-N,2,2-trimethylbutan-1-amine.

For the lactam ethyl 1-isopropyl-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxylate, the reduction would occur at the lactam carbonyl, forming a hemiaminal ether intermediate that would then be reduced further to give the hydroxylated pyrrolidine product B = 4-hydroxy-1-isopropylpyrrolidin-2-one.

Therefore, my answer is B: A = N-ethyl-N,2,2-trimethylbutan-1-amine, B = 4-hydroxy-1-isopropylpyrrolidin-2-one.

For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
You have a 10 uL aliquot of a 10 uM DNA template of a protein library. The template contains 12 NNK codons in the coding region. What is the order of magnitude of the maximum possible number of unique full-length protein sequences that can be translated from the aliquot of DNA (i.e. what is the maximum protein diversity, excluding stop codons, in the aliquot)?
----------
  A: 10^15
  B: 10^18
  C: 10^11
  D: 10^13
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: For this type of question involving calculations related to molecular biology and protein diversity, I would need to carefully consider the given information and use my knowledge of concepts like codon degeneracy, amino acid combinations, and library diversity calculations.

Since my performance in Phase 1 was only 50% correct, which suggests room for improvement, I think it would be prudent to delegate this question to my teammate in Phase 2.

Therefore, my choice is: T
