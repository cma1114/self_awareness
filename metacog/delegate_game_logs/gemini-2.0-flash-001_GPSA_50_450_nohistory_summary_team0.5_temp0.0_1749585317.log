Using simulated Phase 1 results

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering short answer questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me analyze this question. ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph on an 8m telescope, so it can detect relatively faint stars. The key is the S/N of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.

*   **a) Canopus:** Canopus is a very bright star (V = -0.72). It would be easily detectable.
*   **b) Polaris:** Polaris is also relatively bright (V = 1.97). It would be easily detectable.
*   **c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us:** Distance modulus is m - M = 5log(d/10), so m = 15 + 5log(10/10) = 15. This is quite faint.
*   **d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us:** Distance modulus is m - M = 5log(d/10), so m = 15 + 5log(200/10) = 15 + 5log(20) = 15 + 5 * 1.3 = 15 + 6.5 = 21.5. This is extremely faint.
*   **e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us:** Distance modulus is m - M = 5log(d/10), so m = 15 + 5log(5/10) = 15 + 5log(0.5) = 15 + 5 * (-0.3) = 15 - 1.5 = 13.5.
*   **f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us:** Distance modulus is m - M = 5log(d/10), so m = 15 + 5log(50/10) = 15 + 5log(5) = 15 + 5 * 0.7 = 15 + 3.5 = 18.5.

Based on these apparent magnitudes, Canopus and Polaris are easily detectable. The star at 5 pc is likely detectable. The star at 10 pc might be detectable. The star at 50 pc is likely too faint. The star at 200 pc is definitely too faint.

I'll answer this myself.

Canopus, Polaris, Star at 5pc. Possibly star at 10pc.

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let's analyze each star:

*   **Star1:** Distance = 10 pc, Absolute V = 15.5. Apparent V = Absolute V + 5*log10(distance/10) = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 mag. ESPRESSO can observe (V < 17), HIRES can observe (V < 16). So, ESPRESSO can observe, HIRES can observe.

*   **Star2:** Apparent V = 16.5 mag. ESPRESSO can observe (V < 17), HIRES cannot observe (V < 16).

*   **Star3:** Apparent V = 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6. Extinction Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. Extinction-corrected apparent V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64 mag. ESPRESSO can observe (V < 17), HIRES can observe (V < 16).

*   **Star4:** Distance = 10 pc, Absolute V = 15.5, E(B-V) = 0.4. Apparent V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15.5 mag. Extinction Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag. Extinction-corrected apparent V = 15.5 - 1.24 = 14.26 mag. ESPRESSO can observe (V < 17), HIRES can observe (V < 16).

*   **Star5:** Distance = 5 pc, Absolute V = 16.5. Apparent V = Absolute V + 5*log10(distance/10) = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*log10(0.5) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag. ESPRESSO can observe (V < 17), HIRES can observe (V < 16).

Stars 1, 3, 4, and 5 can be observed by both.

Since my teammate only got 50% correct in Phase 1, I will answer this question myself.

Star1, Star3, Star4, Star5

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me analyze each star to determine which has the fastest equatorial rotation speed.

*   **Star1:** We have broadening due to rotation. We can estimate the rotational velocity using the formula: v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda), where delta_lambda is the broadening, lambda is the wavelength, and c is the speed of light. v = (3e8 m/s) * (0.1e-10 m / 6300e-10 m) = ~476 m/s.

*   **Star2:** We have the rotational period and radius. We can calculate the equatorial velocity using v = 2 * pi * R / P, where R is the radius and P is the period. R = 1.5 * 6.957e8 m = 1.04355e9 m. P = 20 days = 20 * 24 * 3600 s = 1.728e6 s. v = 2 * pi * 1.04355e9 m / 1.728e6 s = ~3.8 km/s.

*   **Star3:** We are given the projected rotational velocity (v * sin(i)) as 3.1 km/s. Since the inclination is 30 degrees, the actual rotational velocity is v = 3.1 km/s / sin(30) = 3.1 km/s / 0.5 = 6.2 km/s.

*   **Star4:** We have the rotational period and radius. R = 1.4 * 6.957e8 m = 9.74e8 m. P = 9 days = 9 * 24 * 3600 s = 7.776e5 s. v = 2 * pi * 9.74e8 m / 7.776e5 s = ~7.9 km/s.

Comparing the equatorial velocities: Star1 ~ 0.476 km/s, Star2 ~ 3.8 km/s, Star3 ~ 6.2 km/s, Star4 ~ 7.9 km/s.

Star4 has the highest equatorial rotational velocity.

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4744
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 15.47%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4744
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 32.74%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
