Initial Setup Explanation: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In both phases, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

Question 2:
Given a 60% w/v dibasic strong acid (MW : 120 g/mol), whose molarity is x. Now 200 mL of this x M acid is diluted with 800 mL of water. Let's say molarity becomes y. 100 mL of this y M acid reacts with 300 mL 0.3 M NaOH, molarity of remaining acid is Z. The remaining acid is further allowed to react with a strong diacidic base. Calculate the volume of 0.3 M diacidic base required to neutralize 500 mL of the remaining acid completely.
----------
  A: 458.3 mL
  B: 375 mL
  C: 187.5 mL
  D: 229.2 mL
