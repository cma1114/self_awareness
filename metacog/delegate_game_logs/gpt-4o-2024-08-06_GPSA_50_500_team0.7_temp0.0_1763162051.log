========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gpt-4o-2024-08-06_GPSA_50_500_team0.7_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 70.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 70.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 384
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 16.59%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 16.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 66.67%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 357/384 trials (92.97%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 9/27 (33.33%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 247/357 (69.19%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 256 successes in 384 trials (Accuracy: 66.67%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 8/50 (16.59%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 9/27 (33.33%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.7498, p-value = 0.0801
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 70.00%
- Always Self: 16.59%
- Always Teammate: 70.00%
- Random Choice: 43.29%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1638
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 16.59%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1638
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 43.29%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
