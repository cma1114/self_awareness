========== Phase 2 Complete ==========
Delegation to teammate occurred in 128/450 trials (28.44%).
Your final score in Phase 2: 264/450 (58.67%)
========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14_SimpleMC_50_500_team0.8_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 80.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 80.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 53.40%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 54.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 58.67%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 128/450 trials (28.44%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 162/322 (50.31%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 102/128 (79.69%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 264 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 58.67%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 27/50 (53.40%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 162/322 (50.31%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.4855, p-value = 0.6273
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 53.40%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 66.70%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 53.40%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0263
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 66.70%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0004
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
