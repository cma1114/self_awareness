Subject ID: gemini-1.5-pro_GPQA_50_500_team0.0_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 0.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 0.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 397
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 44.97%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 44.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 40.55%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 16/397 trials (4.03%)

Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 0/16 (0.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 161 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 40.55%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 22/50 (44.97%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 161/381 (42.26%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.2344, p-value = 0.8147
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 44.97%
- Always Self: 44.97%
- Always Teammate: 0.00%
- Random Choice: 22.48%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 44.97%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0777
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 44.97%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0777
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 0.00%):
    Result: Observed score (40.55%) is greater than the 0% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 0%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly GREATER)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 22.48%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
