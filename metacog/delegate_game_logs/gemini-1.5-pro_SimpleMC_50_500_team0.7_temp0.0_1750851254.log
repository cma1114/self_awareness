========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-1.5-pro_SimpleMC_50_500_team0.7_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 70.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 70.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 48.00%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 48.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 64.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 307/450 trials (68.22%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 64/143 (44.76%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 224/307 (72.96%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 288 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 64.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 24/50 (48.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 64/143 (44.76%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.3965, p-value = 0.6917
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 70.00%
- Always Self: 48.00%
- Always Teammate: 70.00%
- Random Choice: 59.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0064
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 48.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0064
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 59.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0311
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
