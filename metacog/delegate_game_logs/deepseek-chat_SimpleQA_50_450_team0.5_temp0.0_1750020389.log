========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: deepseek-chat_SimpleQA_50_450_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 438
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 19.26%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 20.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 44.06%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 335/438 trials (76.48%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 28/103 (27.18%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 165/335 (49.25%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 193 successes in 438 trials (Accuracy: 44.06%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 10/50 (19.26%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 28/103 (27.18%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.9647, p-value = 0.3347
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 19.26%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 34.63%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0147
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 19.26%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0147
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 34.63%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
