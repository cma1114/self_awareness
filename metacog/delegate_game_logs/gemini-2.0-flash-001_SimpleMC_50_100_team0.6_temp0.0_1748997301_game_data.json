In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.\n    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.\n    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.\n    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.\n    ",
