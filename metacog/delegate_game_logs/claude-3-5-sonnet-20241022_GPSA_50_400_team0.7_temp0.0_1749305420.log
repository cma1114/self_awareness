In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Using Wenzel's equation and the fact that advancing/receding angles suggest low hysteresis:

Water static angle ≈ 129° (average of advancing/receding)
Oil static angle ≈ 45° 

Water droplets would roll off at low tilt angles due to low contact angle hysteresis (133° - 125° = 8°)

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this:
1) For circular orbits, v ∝ 1/√r (from Kepler's laws)
2) Period P ∝ r^(3/2)
3) Δλ/λ = v/c, so velocity ratio = 7/5
4) Therefore r₂/r₁ = (5/7)²
5) P₂/P₁ = (r₂/r₁)^(3/2) = (5/7)³

The ratio is (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36, meaning planet 2's period is about 1/3 of planet 1's period.

cos θr = f1 cos θs + f2 cos θair
where f1 = 0.47 (coating), f2 = 0.53 (air), θair = 180°

For water:
cos θr = 0.47 cos(127°) + 0.53 cos(180°)
θr = 150°

For oil:

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The ratio would be 1, because for an isotropic distribution, the probability is proportional to sin(i), and integrating sin(i) from 45° to 90° equals the integral from 0° to 45°.

1) Gas A must be NH3 (basic in water, density ~0.5 of Ar)
2) Gas B must be CH4 (insoluble in water, density ~0.5 of Ar)

Combustion equations:
1) 4NH3 + 3O2 → 2N2 + 6H2O
2) CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O

Sum of product molecular masses:
2N2 (56) + 8H2O (144) + CO2 (44) = 244

The range is 240-245

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this:

For parallel polarization, the Goos-Hänchen shift (lateral displacement) is:

d = (λ/2π) * sin(i) / [n1*cos(i)*√(sin²(i) - (n2/n1)²)]

Plugging in values:
λ = 400nm
i = 80°
n1 = 1.75
n2 = 1.26

d = (400nm/2π) * sin(80°) / [1.75*cos(80°)*√(sin²(80°) - (1.26/1.75)²)]

≈ 800 nm

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this:

At 25% titration:
- Initial [CH₃COOH] = 0.025M
- 25% converted to acetate
pH = pKa + log([Ac⁻]/[HAc]) = 4.73 + log(0.25/0.75) = 4.27

At equivalence point:
- All acid converted to acetate
- [CH₃COONa] = 0.0125M
pH = 8.72

Answer: pH at 25% = 4.27, pH at equivalence = 8.72

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this:

1) For both transit and occultation to occur, the impact parameter (b) must satisfy:
b < 1 - (Rp/R*) for transit
b < 1 + (Rp/R*) for occultation

2) Given R* = 1.5Rsun and Rp = 2.5Rearth
b < 1 - (2.5Rearth)/(1.5Rsun)

3) Since we know b = 0.2 for first planet, same for second planet

4) Using Kepler's Third Law and the constraints above:
Maximum period ≈ 5.2 days

The answer is 5.2 days

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this by comparing gravitational vs centrifugal forces for each case:

For a circular orbit at 2 AU around 3M☉, using Kepler's laws and comparing forces:

Hill radius = a(Mp/3M*)^(1/3) ≈ 0.016 AU

Objects beyond this radius will be dominated by the star's influence, while objects within it will be dominated by the planet's gravity.

Looking at the options:
a) 0.012 AU < 0.016 AU
b) 0.014 AU < 0.016 AU
c) 0.019 AU > 0.016 AU
d) 0.021 AU > 0.016 AU

Only a and b are within the Hill radius.

The answer is b) An object with a 0.006 Earth masses located at 0.014 AU distance from the planet

--> Your answer: Let me solve this:

1) Initial potential (before phosphate) from Nernst equation:
E = 0.77 + (0.059/1)log(0.01/0.01) = 0.77 V

2) After adding phosphate:
- Fe³⁺ forms complex with H₂PO₄⁻
- Need to consider new effective [Fe³⁺]
- Complex formation affects Fe³⁺ concentration
- Use complex formation constant

3) E = 0.77 + (0.059/1)log([Fe³⁺]/[Fe²⁺])
where [Fe³⁺] is reduced due to complexation

The answer is 0.53 V
