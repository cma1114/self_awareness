    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering short answer questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_SimpleQA_50_500_subj0.5_subjgame0.5_nohistory_summary_team0.3_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 30.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 30.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 236
Override Subject Accuracy: 50.00%
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 50.00%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 50.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 31.78%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 171/236 trials (72.46%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 21/65 (32.31%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 54/171 (31.58%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 75 successes in 236 trials (Accuracy: 31.78%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 132/264 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 21/65 (32.31%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -2.5618, p-value = 0.0104
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 40.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5699
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0096
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
