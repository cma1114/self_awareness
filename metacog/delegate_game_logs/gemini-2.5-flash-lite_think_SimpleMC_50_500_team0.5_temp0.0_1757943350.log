========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.5-flash-lite_think_SimpleMC_50_500_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 45.60%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 46.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 42.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 18/450 trials (4.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 182/432 (42.13%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 7/18 (38.89%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 189 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 42.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 23/50 (45.60%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 182/432 (42.13%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.5241, p-value = 0.6002
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 45.60%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 47.80%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0008
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 45.60%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1300
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0008
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 47.80%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0141
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
