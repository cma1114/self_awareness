--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 161 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 35.78%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 14/50 (28.60%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 67/143 (46.85%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.3252, p-value = 0.0201
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 30.00%
- Always Self: 28.60%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 29.30%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0086
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 28.60%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0010
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0086
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 29.30%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0031
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
