========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.0-flash-001_GPQA_50_500_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 397
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 43.85%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 44.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 55.67%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 298/397 trials (75.06%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 67/99 (67.68%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 154/298 (51.68%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 221 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 55.67%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 22/50 (43.85%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 67/99 (67.68%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.7826, p-value = 0.0054
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 43.85%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 46.92%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0271
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 43.85%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0271
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 46.92%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0005
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
