--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 133 successes in 368 trials (Accuracy: 36.14%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 25/50 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 52/105 (49.52%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.0554, p-value = 0.9558
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 40.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0122
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1364
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
