Delegation to teammate occurred in 100/100 trials (100.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 60/100 (60.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 60 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 60.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 164/400 (41.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 0/0 (0.00%)
Cannot perform statistical comparison (insufficient data in one or both phases)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 60.00%
- Always Self: 41.00%
- Always Teammate: 60.00%
- Random Choice: 50.50%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 1.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 41.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0001
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 1.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 50.50%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0581
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
