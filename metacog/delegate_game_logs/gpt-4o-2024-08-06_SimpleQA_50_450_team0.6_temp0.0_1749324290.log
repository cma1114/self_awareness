  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 29.38%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 44.69%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0742
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
