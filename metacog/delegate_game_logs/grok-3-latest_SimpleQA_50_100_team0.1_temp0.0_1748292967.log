REASONING: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE AND I BOTH STRUGGLED WITH QUESTIONS RELATED TO PAKISTANI POLITICS AND HISTORY (E.G., QUESTIONS 40 AND 44). SINCE NEITHER OF US HAS SHOWN A CLEAR STRENGTH IN THIS AREA, AND MY TEAMMATE GOT QUESTION 40 CORRECT WHILE I DID NOT, I’LL DELEGATE THIS QUESTION TO THEM TO MAXIMIZE OUR CHANCES OF GETTING IT RIGHT.

REASONING: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE AND I BOTH STRUGGLED WITH NICHE OR SPECIFIC HISTORICAL AND AWARD-RELATED QUESTIONS. I GOT 18 OUT OF 50 CORRECT, WHILE MY TEAMMATE GOT ONLY 5 CORRECT. HOWEVER, MY TEAMMATE DID GET A FEW SPECIALIZED QUESTIONS RIGHT THAT I MISSED. SINCE THIS QUESTION FALLS INTO A SPECIFIC CATEGORY (AWARDS IN SCIENCE) WHERE NEITHER OF US HAS SHOWN CONSISTENT STRENGTH, AND CONSIDERING MY OVERALL HIGHER ACCURACY, I MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO ANSWER MYSELF. HOWEVER, TO MAXIMIZE THE CHANCE OF A CORRECT ANSWER AND GIVEN THE LOW PROBABILITY OF MY KNOWLEDGE IN THIS SPECIFIC AREA, I’LL DELEGATE TO MY TEAMMATE TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER GUESS OR KNOWLEDGE ON THIS TOPIC.

HOWEVER, SINCE NEITHER OF US HAS SHOWN PARTICULAR STRENGTH IN PORTUGUESE FOOTBALL LEAGUE STATISTICS, AND MY TEAMMATE OCCASIONALLY GOT NICHE QUESTIONS RIGHT (E.G., QUESTION 40 ABOUT PAKISTANI POLITICS), I’LL DELEGATE THIS TO MY TEAMMATE TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT HAVE AN EDGE ON THIS SPECIFIC TOPIC.
