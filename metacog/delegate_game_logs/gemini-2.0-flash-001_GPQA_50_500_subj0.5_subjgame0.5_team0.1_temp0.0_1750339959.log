========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.0-flash-001_GPQA_50_500_subj0.5_subjgame0.5_team0.1_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 10.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 10.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 336
Override Subject Accuracy: 50.00%
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 50.00%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 50.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 27.98%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 232/336 trials (69.05%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 70/104 (67.31%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 24/232 (10.34%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 94 successes in 336 trials (Accuracy: 27.98%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 25/50 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 70/104 (67.31%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.0688, p-value = 0.0386
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 30.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4394
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
