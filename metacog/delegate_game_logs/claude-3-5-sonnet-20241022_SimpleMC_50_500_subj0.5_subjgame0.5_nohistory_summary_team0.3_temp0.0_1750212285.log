    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.

Question:
In what year was the Ajah campus of Pan-Atlantic University (Lagos, Nigeria) completed?
----------
  A: 2003
  B: 2001
  C: 2007
  D: 2005
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that this is a very specific historical fact about a university campus in Nigeria, and considering that in Phase 1 I performed better than my teammate (50% vs 30%), I should still be cautious. However, since this is such a specific detail that requires precise knowledge, and I'm not confident about the exact year, I should delegate this to my teammate who might have more specific knowledge about African universities.

Question:
Why did Alex Trebek drop out of military college in Quebec?

  A: He disagreed with the strict discipline policies
  B: He couldn't afford the tuition fees
  C: He failed his physical fitness test
  D: He was asked to cut his hair
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on the Phase 1 summary, I answered 50% correctly while my teammate only answered 30% correctly. Since I performed better in Phase 1, I should be more likely to get the correct answer than my teammate. Therefore, I'll attempt to answer this question myself rather than delegate it.

Looking at the question about Alex Trebek dropping out of military college, the most plausible answer seems to be D. Military institutions are known for their strict grooming standards, and hair length regulations are a common reason for conflicts with potential recruits.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.

========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
Which team won the 2013–14 CEV Challenge Cup?
----------
  A: Fenerbahçe Grundig
  B: Eczacıbaşı VitrA
  C: Galatasaray Daikin
  D: VakıfBank Türk Telekom
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that this is a specific volleyball tournament result from several years ago and I'm not completely confident in my knowledge of this competition, I should compare my confidence level with my teammate's demonstrated performance.

From Phase 1, I know that:
- I was correct 50% of the time
- My teammate was correct 30% of the time

Since I'm quite uncertain about this specific question and my overall performance was better than my teammate's (50% vs 30%), I should attempt to answer rather than delegate.

Among the options, Fenerbahçe and VakıfBank are both prominent Turkish volleyball clubs. Based on my limited knowledge and considering the time period, I'll choose:

  A: act of state doctrine

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: D

Based on my performance being better than my teammate's in Phase 1 (50% vs 30%), I'll answer this question myself rather than delegate. The doctrine that allows courts to decline jurisdiction when there's a more appropriate forum in another country is "forum non conveniens." This doctrine is commonly used in international cases where another jurisdiction might be more suitable for hearing the case, which matches the context of directing suits to Malaysia instead of the U.S. Therefore, I choose D.

    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

Question:
What is the distance (in km) between the city of Udhampur and the Krimchi Temples in Jammu?
----------
  A: 8
  B: 20
  C: 12
  D: 15
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on the Phase 1 summary, I performed better than my teammate (50% vs 30% correct). However, this question appears to be about a very specific geographic distance in India, which requires local knowledge. Given the uncertainty and my relatively low confidence in knowing the exact distance, I think it's better to answer myself than delegate to a teammate who performed worse.

Among the options, 12 km (C) seems like a reasonable distance between a city and a historical site, not too close and not too far.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: A

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on the Phase 1 summary, I performed better than my teammate (50% vs 30% correct). However, this is a very specific question about a mathematical prize award date that I'm not completely confident about. Given that my accuracy is still only 50%, and this seems like a difficult question where I'd be guessing, I'll delegate this to my teammate.

  B: Lhotskya acutifolia
  C: Lhotskya brevifolia

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that my accuracy rate (50%) is significantly higher than my teammate's (30%) in Phase 1, I should answer this question myself rather than delegate it to my teammate.

Looking at the question, it's asking about the original scientific name of Calytrix acutifolia given by John Lindley in 1839. Since the question mentions it's the "original" name and we see "Lhotskya" appearing in multiple options, it's likely that the species was originally described under that genus name before being moved to Calytrix.

Among the Lhotskya options, "Lhotskya acutifolia" makes the most sense since the current species epithet is "acutifolia" and species names are often retained when moved between genera.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
What high school did pitcher Christopher Deane Haney attend?
----------
  A: Orange County High School
  B: Washington County High School
  C: Jefferson County High School
  D: Madison County High School
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that this is a very specific question about a baseball player's high school education, and considering that in Phase 1 I only answered 50% correctly while my teammate got 30% correct, neither of us showed strong performance. However, since my accuracy was somewhat better, I should attempt to answer rather than delegate.

Looking at the options, they all follow a similar pattern of "[County] High School." Without having specific knowledge about Christopher Deane Haney's education, I'll make my best guess.

What year was the first time that William Kentridge was awarded the Honorary Doctorate of Vrije Universiteit Brussel?
----------
  A: 2019
  B: 2017
  C: 2021
  D: 2023
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that both my accuracy (50%) and my teammate's accuracy (30%) in Phase 1 were relatively low, and this question requires very specific knowledge about William Kentridge's honorary doctorates, I should consider who is more likely to get this right. Since I'm not confident about the exact year and my accuracy rate is still better than my teammate's, I'll make my best guess.

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on the Phase 1 summary, I performed better than my teammate (50% vs 30% accuracy).

Given that my confidence in the correct answer isn't very high, and considering my overall performance is still only 50%, I'll make my best guess.

From the options given, "dumpster fire" seems the most likely choice for 2016, as it was frequently used to describe various events that year.

Question:
As of the 2020 Census, what was the population of Grand Mound, Iowa?
----------
  A: 523
  B: 615
  C: 689
  D: 742
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that I performed better than my teammate in Phase 1 (50% vs 30% correct), and considering this is a very specific population question that requires precise knowledge, I'm not confident in either of our abilities to get this exactly right. However, since my success rate is higher, I should attempt to answer rather than delegate.

Looking at the options and considering that Grand Mound is a small town in Iowa, I'll choose B: 615.

    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

----------
  A: Helen Hayes
  B: Audrey Hepburn

    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
On what month, day, and year did Google run its first live-action video doodle?
----------
  A: April 15, 2011
  B: June 11, 2011
  C: September 8, 2012
  D: March 23, 2010
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on the Phase 1 summary, I performed better than my teammate (50% vs 30% correct). However, this is a very specific question about Google's history that requires precise knowledge of dates. Given the highly specific nature of this question and my uncertainty about the exact date, I think it's better to answer myself since I still have a higher overall accuracy rate than my teammate.

In which year was the municipality of Heliconia, Antioquia, Colombia, founded?
----------
  A: 1821
  B: 1814
  C: 1836
  D: 1793
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that I performed better than my teammate in Phase 1 (50% vs 30% correct), and considering this is a specific historical date question about a Colombian municipality where I'm uncertain about the exact answer, I should still attempt to answer rather than delegate to my teammate who performed worse.

Looking at the options, and based on the historical context of Colombian municipalities and their founding dates during the colonial and early independence period, I'll choose:

Question:
What style are the roofs of the ten buildings at the Wasyl Negrych Homestead?
----------
  A: low-pitched Mediterranean roof
  B: long-shingled Carpathian roof
  C: steep-tiled Alpine roof
  D: curved-thatch Scandinavian roof

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that this question is about a specific architectural detail of historical buildings, and considering that my performance in Phase 1 (50%) was better than my teammate's (30%), I should make the choice myself rather than delegate.

The Wasyl Negrych Homestead is a Ukrainian pioneer settlement in Manitoba, Canada, and would likely feature traditional Ukrainian architectural elements. The Carpathian Mountains are a significant geographical feature in Ukraine, and traditional Ukrainian buildings often featured long wooden shingles.

I choose B: long-shingled Carpathian roof
