--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 231 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 51.33%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 25/50 (50.60%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 40/66 (60.61%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.1397, p-value = 0.2544
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.60%
