In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
--> Your answer: \(v = \frac{1000}{2\times10^{-6}} = 5\times10^8\ \text{m/s}\), which is > c, so relativistic dilation must apply.  
Let \(\tau=2\times10^{-6}s\), \(L=1000m\).  
Proper lifetime ≈ \(\tau_0=\tau/\gamma\).  
But \(L=v\tau=v\gamma\tau_0\Rightarrow L=c\tau\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}}\).  
Solve numerically → \(\gamma\approx1.34\), \(v\approx0.67c\approx2.0\times10^8\,\text{m/s}\).

Choice registered. Moving to the next question...

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Answer:  
Single‐particle energies: \(E_n = n^2 E\).  
Filling lowest distinct \(n\) with two spins each:

- Ground state: \(n=1,2\) filled → \(E_g = 2(1^2 + 2^2)E = 10E.\)
- 1st excited: promote one from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\) → \(E_1 = (1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2)E/???\) Wait: two each. So energies (1,1,2,2→ 10E)→ next: (1,1,2,3) = \(E_1 = 15E.\)
- 2nd excited: promote other 2→\(1,1,3,3\) \(E_2=20E.\)  
Hence: \(E_g=10E,\ E_1=15E,\ E_2=20E.\)

Wavefunction \( \psi(x) = \sqrt{\kappa}\, e^{-\kappa |x|} \),  
with \(\kappa = m\alpha/\hbar^2\).

Probability \(|x|<x_0\):
\[
P = 2\!\int_0^{x_0}\! |\psi|^2 dx = 2\kappa \int_0^{x_0} e^{-2\kappa x}dx = 1 - e^{-2\kappa x_0}.
\]

Set \(P=\tfrac12\):  
\[
1 - e^{-2\kappa x_0} = \tfrac12 \Rightarrow e^{-2\kappa x_0} = \tfrac12.
\]
\[
x_0 = \frac{\ln 2}{2\kappa} = \frac{\hbar^2 \ln 2}{2m\alpha}.
\]

**Answer:** \(x_0 = \dfrac{\hbar^{2}\ln 2}{2m\alpha}\).

Let λₐ = ln2 / 3.0, λᵦ = ln2 / 0.098, N₀ = 5×10³⁴.  
After 10 min, remaining X nuclei: N = N₀ e^(−(λₐ+λᵦ)t).  
Activity of α–decay: Aₐ = λₐ N = N₀ λₐ e^(−(λₐ+λᵦ)t).  
Numerically,  
λₐ = 0.231 min⁻¹, λᵦ = 7.07 min⁻¹ → (λₐ+λᵦ)=7.301 min⁻¹.  
e^(−7.301×10)=6.8×10⁻³².  
So Aₐ ≈ 5×10³⁴×0.231×6.8×10⁻³² ≈ 7.9×10² decays/min = 13 s⁻¹.

\[
H = A(S_1\cdot S_2 + S_1\cdot S_3 + S_2\cdot S_3)=\tfrac{A}{2}[S_\text{tot}^2 - \tfrac{3}{2}]

With \(S_\text{tot}=\tfrac{1}{2}\): \(S(S+1)=\tfrac{3}{4}\).

First two zeros of \(J_1(x)\): \(x_1 = 3.8317\), \(x_2 = 7.0156\).  
Hence angular separation:  
\[
\Delta\theta = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{ka} = \frac{3.1839\,\lambda}{2\pi a} \approx 0.507 \frac{\lambda}{a}.

Choice registered. Moving to the next question...

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
--> Your answer: We must use the **Boltzmann factor ratio**:

\[
\frac{n_2/n_1|_{6000}}{n_2/n_1|_{5500}} = 
\frac{e^{-E_{21}/k(6000)}}{e^{-E_{21}/k(5500)}} 
= e^{-E_{21}/k (1/6000 - 1/5500)}.
\]

Compute step by step:

\(E_{21} = h c / \lambda.\)

\(\lambda = 1448\,\text{Å}=1.448\times10^{-7}\,\text{m}.\)

\(E_{21} = \frac{6.626\times10^{-34}\times3\times10^8}{1.448\times10^{-7}} = 1.37\times10^{-18}\,\text{J} = 8.57\,\text{eV}\).

Then \(k = 8.617\times10^{-5}\,\text{eV/K}\).

Compute exponent:

\[
\Delta = \frac{E_{21}}{k}(1/6000 - 1/5500)
= \frac{8.57}{8.617\times10^{-5}}(1.667\times10^{-4} - 1.818\times10^{-4})
\]
\(= 99499 \times (-1.51\times10^{-5}) = -1.50.\)

So
\[
\text{ratio factor} = e^{-(-1.50)} = e^{1.50} \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus the ratio \( \frac{(n_2/n_1)_{6000}}{(n_2/n_1)_{5500}} \approx 4.5.\)

**Answer:** about **4.5 times larger** when the star has no spots.
