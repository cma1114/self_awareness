========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gpt-4o-mini_SimpleQA_50_500_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 442
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 8.54%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 8.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 30.32%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 240/442 trials (54.30%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 15/202 (7.43%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 119/240 (49.58%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 134 successes in 442 trials (Accuracy: 30.32%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 4/50 (8.54%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 15/202 (7.43%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.1377, p-value = 0.8905
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 8.54%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 29.27%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 8.54%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 29.27%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6381
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
