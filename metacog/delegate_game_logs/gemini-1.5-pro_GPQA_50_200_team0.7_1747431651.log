--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 93 successes in 200 trials (Accuracy: 46.50%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 111/247 (44.97%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 84/185 (45.41%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.0963, p-value = 0.9233
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 70.00%
- Always Self: 44.97%
- Always Teammate: 70.00%
