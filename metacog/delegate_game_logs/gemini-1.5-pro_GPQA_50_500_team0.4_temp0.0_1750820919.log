--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 183 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 46.10%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 22/50 (44.97%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 182/391 (46.55%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.3402, p-value = 0.7337
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 44.97%
- Always Self: 44.97%
- Always Teammate: 40.00%
- Random Choice: 42.48%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 44.97%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6502
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 44.97%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6502
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0139
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 42.48%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1551
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
