Question:
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.

This product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.

ozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.

in the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?
----------
  A: triplet of triplets
  B: triplet
  C: pentet
  D: doublet of triplets

Question:
The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement is a chemical reaction involving the conversion of a pinacol molecule, containing two adjacent alcohol groups, into a pinacolone under acidic conditions. It proceeds through the protonation of one alcohol group, followed by a 1,2-hydride shift, leading to the formation of a ketone (pinacolone) and the rearrangement of the molecule's structure.
What are the starting materials and products of the following Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reactions?
A + H2SO4 ---> 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one
methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 ---> B
----------
  A: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate
  B: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate
  C: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate
  D: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate

========== Phase 2 Complete ==========
Delegation to teammate occurred in 23/397 trials (5.79%).
Your final score in Phase 2: 187/397 (47.10%)
========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.5-flash-lite_think_GPQA_50_500_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 397
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 64.43%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 64.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 47.10%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 23/397 trials (5.79%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 176/374 (47.06%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 11/23 (47.83%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 187 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 47.10%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 32/50 (64.43%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 176/374 (47.06%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -2.2506, p-value = 0.0244
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 64.43%
- Always Self: 64.43%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 57.21%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 64.43%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 64.43%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2695
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 57.21%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0001
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
