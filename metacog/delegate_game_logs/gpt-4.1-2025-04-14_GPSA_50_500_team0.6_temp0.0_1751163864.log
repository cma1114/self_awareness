In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Aluminum is the metal.

1. Moles of KClO₃: 49 g / 122.5 g/mol = 0.4 mol  
O₂ produced: 2 KClO₃ → 2 KCl + 3 O₂  
0.4 mol KClO₃ → 0.6 mol O₂

2. 10.8 g impure metal, 20% pure → 2.16 g Al  
Moles Al: 2.16 g / 27 g/mol = 0.08 mol

3. Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃  
4 Al + 3 O₂ → 2 Al₂O₃  
0.08 mol Al needs 0.06 mol O₂ (limiting reagent is Al)

Al₂O₃ formed: 0.08 mol Al × (2 mol Al₂O₃ / 4 mol Al) = 0.04 mol Al₂O₃

4. Reduction: Al₂O₃ + 3 C → 2 Al + 3 CO  
0.04 mol Al₂O₃ × 3 = 0.12 mol C

Mass of C needed: 0.12 mol × 12 g/mol = **1.44 g**

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: \[
\frac{n_3}{n_1} = \frac{g_3}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_3 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]
For hydrogen, \(g_n = 2n^2\), so \(g_3/g_1 = 18/2 = 9\).

\(E_1 = -13.6\,\text{eV}\), \(E_3 = -13.6/9 = -1.51\,\text{eV}\), so \(E_3 - E_1 = 12.09\,\text{eV}\).

At \(T = 10,000\,\text{K}\), \(kT \approx 0.86\,\text{eV}\).

\[
\frac{n_3}{n_1} = 9 \exp\left(-\frac{12.09}{0.86}\right) = 9 \exp(-14.06) \approx 9 \times 7.9 \times 10^{-7} \approx 7.1 \times 10^{-6}

\[
E = \hbar \omega

\[
p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c}

Choice registered. Moving to the next question...

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 500 mL PH₃ → 600 mL total gas after decomposition.

Decomposition reaction:
\[
4 \text{PH}_3 \rightarrow \text{P}_4 + 6 \text{H}_2
\]

From 4 PH₃ (4 × 22.4 L) → 6 H₂ (6 × 22.4 L)
So, 4 volumes PH₃ → 6 volumes H₂

Let x = PH₃ decomposed (in mL)
Initial: 500 mL PH₃
After: (500 - x) mL PH₃ + (6/4)x = 1.5x mL H₂ + P₄ (solid, negligible volume)

Total volume after reaction:
\[
(500 - x) + 1.5x = 500 + 0.5x = 600
\implies 0.5x = 100 \implies x = 200 \text{ mL}
\]

So, PH₃ decomposed = 200 mL

H₂ formed = 1.5 × 200 = 300 mL

Now, H₂ + O₂ → H₂O (in fuel cell)
\[
2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]
50 mL O₂ reacts with 2 × 50 = 100 mL H₂

So, unreacted H₂ = 300 mL (formed) - 100 mL (reacted) = 200 mL

**Final answer:**  
200 mL

\[
\Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \text{ J}
\]
\[
k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.95 \times 10^4
\]
\[
\left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: \[
U = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \sum_{i<j} \frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}}
\]

Each charge is \(2e\). 12 charges are at 2 m from P, 13th at P.

- Each of the 12 charges is distance 2 m from P (the 13th charge).
- Each pair among the 12 charges is at least 2 m apart (minimum energy: arrange them as far apart as possible, e.g., vertices of an icosahedron).

Energy consists of:
1. Interaction of each of the 12 charges with the central charge at P.
2. Interaction among the 12 charges on the sphere.

1. Each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge:
\[
U_1 = 12 \times \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{(2e)^2}{2}
= 12 \times \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{4e^2}{2}
= 12 \times \frac{2e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}
= \frac{24e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}
\]

2. Interaction among the 12 charges:
There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) pairs, each at least 2 m apart (minimum energy). So,
\[
U_2 = 66 \times \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{(2e)^2}{2}
= 66 \times \frac{4e^2}{2 \cdot 4\pi\epsilon_0}
= 66 \times \frac{2e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}
= \frac{132e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}
\]

Total energy:
\[
U = U_1 + U_2 = \frac{24e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} + \frac{132e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = \frac{156e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}
\]

Plug in values:
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \) C
- \( \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = 8.988 \times 10^9 \) N·m²/C²

\[
U = 156 \times 8.988 \times 10^9 \times \frac{(1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2}{4}
\]

First, \( (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \)

\[
U = 156 \times 8.988 \times 10^9 \times \frac{2.566 \times 10^{-38}}{4}
\]
\[
= 156 \times 8.988 \times 10^9 \times 0.6415 \times 10^{-38}
\]
\[
= 156 \times 8.988 \times 0.6415 \times 10^9 \times 10^{-38}
\]
\[
8.988 \times 0.6415 = 5.765
\]
\[
156 \times 5.765 = 899.94
\]
\[
U = 899.94 \times 10^9 \times 10^{-38}
= 8.9994 \times 10^{11} \times 10^{-38}
= 8.9994 \times 10^{-27}
\]

So, \( U \approx 9.00 \times 10^{-27} \) J (to three decimals).

**Final answer:**  
\( \boxed{9.00 \times 10^{-27}} \) J

\( v/c = 60{,}000/299{,}792.458 \approx 0.2001 \)

\( \gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - 0.2001^2} \approx 1.0206 \)

\( \Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t = 1.0206 \times 50 = 51.03\,\text{s} \)

Distance in Galaxy frame: \( d = v \Delta t' = 60{,}000 \times 51.03 = 3,061,800\,\text{km} \)

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The nucleus X is \( ^6\text{Li} \) (3 protons, 3 neutrons).

Speed \( v = 0.96c \).

Relativistic energy:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]
where
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

Mass of \( ^6\text{Li} \):  
Atomic mass ≈ 6.015 u  
1 u = 931.494 MeV/c²  
So,
\[
m = 6.015 \times 931.494 = 5604.6~\text{MeV}/c^2
\]

Total energy:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5604.6~\text{MeV} = 20023.6~\text{MeV}

where \(\Delta E_i = \hbar / \tau_i\).

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{10^{-9}\ \text{s}} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-16}\ \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{10^{-8}\ \text{s}} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-17}\ \text{eV}

\[
\Delta E \gtrsim 7.3 \times 10^{-16}\ \text{eV}

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The apparent contact angle \(\theta^*\) can be calculated using the Cassie-Baxter equation:

\[
\cos\theta^* = f_s \cos\theta + f_v \cos\theta_{air}
\]

where:
- \(f_s\) = fraction of solid in contact (0.47)
- \(f_v\) = fraction of air in contact (0.53)
- \(\theta\) = contact angle on smooth surface
- \(\theta_{air} = 180^\circ\) (so \(\cos\theta_{air} = -1\))

For water (\(\theta = 127^\circ\)):
\[
\cos 127^\circ = -0.6018
\]
\[
\cos\theta^* = 0.47 \times (-0.6018) + 0.53 \times (-1) = -0.2828 - 0.53 = -0.8128
\]
\[
\theta^*_{water} = \arccos(-0.8128) \approx 144.8^\circ
\]

For oil (\(\theta = 96^\circ\)):
\[
\cos 96^\circ = -0.1045
\]
\[
\cos\theta^* = 0.47 \times (-0.1045) + 0.53 \times (-1) = -0.0491 - 0.53 = -0.5791
\]
\[
\theta^*_{oil} = \arccos(-0.5791) \approx 125.4^\circ
\]

**Final answers:**
- Water: \(145^\circ\)
- Oil: \(125^\circ\)

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: \[
\frac{D_A}{D_B} = \frac{M_{c,A}^{5/3}}{M_{c,B}^{5/3}}
\]

where \(M_c\) is the chirp mass.

For A: \(m_1=10, m_2=25\)  
For B: \(m_1=35, m_2=50\)

\[
M_c = \frac{(m_1 m_2)^{3/5}}{(m_1 + m_2)^{1/5}}
\]

Calculate for A:
\[
M_{c,A} = \frac{(10 \times 25)^{3/5}}{(10+25)^{1/5}}
\]
\[
= \frac{250^{3/5}}{35^{1/5}}
\]

Calculate for B:
\[
M_{c,B} = \frac{(35 \times 50)^{3/5}}{(35+50)^{1/5}}
\]
\[
= \frac{1750^{3/5}}{85^{1/5}}
\]

So,
\[
\frac{D_A}{D_B} = \left( \frac{M_{c,A}}{M_{c,B}} \right)^{5/3}
\]

Plug in numbers:

\(250^{3/5} = e^{(3/5)\ln 250} \approx e^{(3/5)\times 5.521} \approx e^{3.312} \approx 27.45\)  
\(35^{1/5} = e^{(1/5)\ln 35} \approx e^{(1/5)\times 3.555} \approx e^{0.711} \approx 2.036\)  
So \(M_{c,A} \approx 27.45/2.036 \approx 13.48\)

\(1750^{3/5} = e^{(3/5)\ln 1750} \approx e^{(3/5)\times 7.469} \approx e^{4.481} \approx 88.44\)  
\(85^{1/5} = e^{(1/5)\ln 85} \approx e^{(1/5)\times 4.443} \approx e^{0.889} \approx 2.432\)  
So \(M_{c,B} \approx 88.44/2.432 \approx 36.38\)

\[
\frac{D_A}{D_B} = \left( \frac{13.48}{36.38} \right)^{5/3} \approx (0.3707)^{1.6667} \approx 0.186
\]

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: \[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3(1 + 2\cos\alpha + 2\cos^2\alpha - 3\cos^3\alpha)}}
\]
Given \(a = 10\,\text{Å}\), \(\alpha = 30^\circ\), \(\cos 30^\circ = \sqrt{3}/2\):

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3[1 + 2(\sqrt{3}/2) + 2(3/4) - 3(\sqrt{3}/2)^3]}}
\]
\[
= \frac{10}{\sqrt{3[1 + \sqrt{3} + 1.5 - 3 \times (3\sqrt{3}/8)]}}
\]
\[
= \frac{10}{\sqrt{3[2.5 + \sqrt{3} - (9\sqrt{3}/8)]}}
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732
\]
\[
2.5 + 1.732 = 4.232
\]
\[
9\sqrt{3}/8 \approx 1.949
\]
\[
4.232 - 1.949 = 2.283
\]
\[
3 \times 2.283 = 6.849
\]
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{6.849}} \approx \frac{10}{2.618} \approx 3.82\,\text{Å}
\]

**Final answer:**  
\[
\boxed{3.8\,\text{Å}}

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The speed \( v \) is given by:

\[
L = v \gamma \tau_0
\]

where \( L = 1000\,\text{m} \), \( \tau_0 = 2 \times 10^{-6}\,\text{s} \), and \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

So,

\[
1000 = v \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \cdot 2 \times 10^{-6}
\]

\[
\frac{1000}{2 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^8 = \frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Let \( \beta = v/c \):

\[
5 \times 10^8 = \frac{\beta c}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

\[
\frac{5 \times 10^8}{c} = \frac{\beta}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

\( c = 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s:

\[
\frac{5 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{\beta}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]
\[
1.6667 = \frac{\beta}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

\[
1.6667 \sqrt{1 - \beta^2} = \beta
\]
\[
1.6667^2 (1 - \beta^2) = \beta^2
\]
\[
2.7778 (1 - \beta^2) = \beta^2
\]
\[
2.7778 - 2.7778\beta^2 = \beta^2
\]
\[
2.7778 = 3.7778\beta^2
\]
\[
\beta^2 = \frac{2.7778}{3.7778} \approx 0.735
\]
\[
\beta \approx 0.857
\]
\[
v = 0.857c \approx 2.57 \times 10^8\,\text{m/s}
\]

**Final answer:**  
\[
v \approx 2.57 \times 10^8\,\text{m/s}
\]
Choice registered. Moving to the next question...

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Answer:

The paramagnetic coupling (Zeeman effect) energy is \(\Delta E_Z = \mu_B B m\), where \(\mu_B \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5}\) eV/T, \(B = 1\) T, and \(m\) is small (e.g., \(m = 1\)).

\[
\Delta E_Z \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \text{ eV}
\]

The transition energy for \(\lambda = 0.4861\,\mu\text{m} = 486.1\,\text{nm}\):

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \approx \frac{1240\,\text{eV}\cdot\text{nm}}{486.1\,\text{nm}} \approx 2.55\,\text{eV}
\]

Order of magnitude comparison:

\[
\frac{\Delta E_Z}{E} \sim \frac{10^{-5}\,\text{eV}}{1\,\text{eV}} = 10^{-5}
\]

**The paramagnetic coupling term is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.**
