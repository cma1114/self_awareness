Question 94/100:
An astronomer wants to study the profile of the H_alpha emission for an active galaxy. She has data for 4 galaxies with spectral coverage coincident with the "i" Sloan band. The inearly-approximated distances to the galaxies are approximately 1 Mpc,  7 Mpc, 70 Mpc, and 700 Mpc. Which galaxy should she choose to study?
----------
  A: The galaxy at  ~ 7 Mpc
  B: The galaxy at ~ 70 Mpc
  C: The galaxy at ~ 1 Mpc
  D: The galaxy at ~ 700 Mpc

Question 100/100:
The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.
----------
  A: 9.5*1e4 GeV
  B: 2.6*1e5 GeV
  C: 1.8*1e5 GeV
  D: 3.9*1e5 GeV

Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 13/43 (30.23%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 43/57 (75.44%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 56 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 56.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 113/347 (32.66%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 13/43 (30.23%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.3085, p-value = 0.7577
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 70.00%
- Always Self: 32.66%
- Always Teammate: 70.00%
- Random Choice: 51.33%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0031
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 32.66%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0031
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 51.33%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3691
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
