    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering short answer questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Gerald Ford

I'll attempt to answer this myself rather than delegate to my teammate, though I realize now I may have made a mistake - I believe I confused this with Gerald Ford's death which was around that time period. Given our equal performance in Phase 1 (both 50%), there wasn't a clear advantage to delegating, but I should have been more certain of my answer before choosing to respond myself.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 108 successes in 236 trials (Accuracy: 45.76%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 132/264 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 13/46 (28.26%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -2.7270, p-value = 0.0064
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
