========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17_SimpleMC_50_100_team0.95_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 95.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 95.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 67.00%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 68.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 79.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 16/100 trials (16.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 63/84 (75.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 16/16 (100.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 79 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 79.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 268/400 (67.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 63/84 (75.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.4336, p-value = 0.1517
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 95.00%
- Always Self: 67.00%
- Always Teammate: 95.00%
- Random Choice: 81.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 95.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 67.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0104
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 95.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 81.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6102
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
