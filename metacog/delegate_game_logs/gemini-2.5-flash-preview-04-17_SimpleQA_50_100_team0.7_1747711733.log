--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 64 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 64.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 142/396 (35.89%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 3/13 (23.08%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.9479, p-value = 0.3432
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 70.00%
- Always Self: 35.89%
- Always Teammate: 70.00%
- Random Choice: 52.94%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1916
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 35.89%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1916
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 52.94%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0276
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
