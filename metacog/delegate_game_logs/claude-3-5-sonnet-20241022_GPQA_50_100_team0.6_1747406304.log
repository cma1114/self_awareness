Question 22/100:
Congratulations, you just landed your dream job at one of the top structural biology labs at Stanford University in California. Without further ado, the Principal Investigator explains that the priority of the moment is to produce in E. coli BL21 then purify as quickly as possible the Human P53 protein.

The amino acid sequence of this protein is as follows:

Question 94/100:
Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?

Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_GPQA_50_100_team0.6
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 60.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 60.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 42.73%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 42.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 67.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 75/100 trials (75.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 17/25 (68.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 50/75 (66.67%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 67 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 67.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 148/347 (42.73%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 17/25 (68.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.4640, p-value = 0.0137
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 60.00%
- Always Self: 42.73%
- Always Teammate: 60.00%
- Random Choice: 51.36%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1842
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 42.73%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1842
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 51.36%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0018
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
