========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.0-flash-001_SimpleMC_50_500_team0.1_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 10.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 10.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 42.60%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 42.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 11.56%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 425/450 trials (94.44%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 13/25 (52.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 39/425 (9.18%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 52 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 11.56%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 21/50 (42.60%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 13/25 (52.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.8201, p-value = 0.4122
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 42.60%
- Always Self: 42.60%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 26.30%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 42.60%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 42.60%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2710
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 26.30%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
