In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this:

1) Initial potential (before phosphate) from Nernst equation:
E = E° + (RT/nF)ln([Fe³⁺]/[Fe²⁺]) = 0.77 V (since [Fe³⁺]=[Fe²⁺])

2) After adding phosphate, Fe³⁺ forms complex with H₂PO₄⁻:
Fe³⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ [Fe(H₂PO₄)]²⁺
K = 10²¹

3) This reduces free [Fe³⁺], changing potential:
E = 0.77 + (0.059/1)log([Fe³⁺]free/0.01)

4) Calculate [Fe³⁺]free using K and [H₂PO₄⁻]:
[Fe³⁺]free = 0.01/(1 + 10²¹ × 6.97×10⁻³)

5) E ≈ 0.47 V

Answer: 0.47 V

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The hydrogen tartrate's low solubility is due to strong crystal lattice formation through hydrogen bonding networks between the ionized and non-ionized carboxyl groups. This could be verified by measuring solubility at different pH values and by X-ray crystallography to confirm the hydrogen bonding pattern.

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this step by step:

[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 and [Fe/H]₁ = 0 means [Si/H]₁ = 0.3
[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 and [Mg/H]₂ = 0 means [Si/H]₂ = -0.3

Therefore, ratio of Si atoms = 10^([Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂) = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6 = 4

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this:
1) Total volume = 1.2L
2) Moles: HCl = 0.08, Ba(OH)2 = 0.09 (giving 0.18 OH-), CH3COOH = 0.05
3) Base excess = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.1 moles OH-
4) This neutralizes all acetic acid and leaves 0.05 moles OH-
5) [OH-] = 0.05/1.2 = 0.0417M
pH = 14 + log(0.0417) = 12.62

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this:
1) For same mass stars and same mass planets at same inclination, the period ratio depends only on orbital parameters
2) For planet 1 (circular orbit), v₁ is constant
3) For planet 2, (ra/rp = 1.5) means e = 0.2
4) Using Kepler's laws and the RV amplitudes:
   - Planet 1: 4 mÅ = (v₁/c)λ
   - Planet 2: 1.77 MeV = hc/λ × (v₂/c)
5) After calculations, P₂/P₁ = 8

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this step by step:

1) First solution: 
- 2 mmol CH₃COOH (20 mL × 0.1M)
- 0.8 mmol NaOH (40 mL × 0.02M)
Creates buffer with 1.2 mmol acid, 0.8 mmol salt

2) Second solution:
Additional 0.1 mmol NaOH (5 mL × 0.02M)
New buffer: 1.1 mmol acid, 0.9 mmol salt

3) Third solution:
0.1 mmol NaOH in 65 mL water
pH = 14 + log(0.1/65)

The difference would be approximately 3.5 pH units.
