========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
Two compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Through the mentioned treatment two different diketones are produced. Select the proper starting materials A and B for the reactions.
A + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione
B + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione
----------
  A: A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one
  B: A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol
  C: A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol
  D: A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on my performance in Phase 1 with similar organic chemistry questions and my teammate's generally good performance, I will delegate this question.

------------------------------
Question:
Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,
Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.
Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol
----------
  A: 11200 kJ/mol
  B: 1900 kJ/g
  C: 11.44 kJ/g
  D: 67.4 kJ/mol
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, let's count the atoms and bonds:
- 12 carbons
- 20 hydrogens
- 2 double bonds (C=C)
- 7 single C-C bonds
- 20 C-H bonds

2) To form the molecule:
- Need 12 × 1000 kJ/mol for C atomization
- Need 10 × 100 kJ/mol for H2 → 2H
- Form 7 × 200 kJ/mol C-C bonds
- Form 2 × 300 kJ/mol C=C bonds
- Form 20 × 400 kJ/mol C-H bonds

3) Calculation:
12000 + 1000 - 1400 - 600 - 8000 = 3000 kJ/mol

4) Looking at the options and considering the units:
3000 kJ/mol ÷ 164 g/mol ≈ 18.3 kJ/g

None of the answers match my calculation exactly. Since I'm not completely confident in my work and the teammate has shown good accuracy, I'll delegate this question.

For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
An organic chemist performs two reactions.
Reaction I:
(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.
Reaction II:
Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.
The progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.
How many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?
----------
  A: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
  B: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC
  C: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
  D: 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on my performance in Phase 1 with similar organic chemistry questions and my teammate's generally better performance in this area, I will delegate this question.

Question:
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Since this involves complex astronomical calculations and my teammate has shown good accuracy with astronomy questions (like questions 23, 33), I'll delegate this.
