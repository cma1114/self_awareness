In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve:

1) Total volume = 250 μCi ÷ 375 μCi/mL = 0.667 mL

2) For specific activity of 300 mCi/mmol from original 70.7 Ci/mmol:
Need to add cold methionine to dilute specific activity
[(70.7 Ci/mmol × 0.667 mL) + (0 × x)] ÷ (0.667 + x) = 0.3 Ci/mmol
x = 156 μL of cold methionine

Total volume = 0.667 mL
Cold methionine needed = 156 μL

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me analyze each star:

Star1: M = 15.5, d = 10pc
m = M + 5log(d/10) = 15.5 (visible to both)

Star2: Given m = 16.5 (too faint for HIRES)

Star3: m = 15.5 (visible to both)

Star4: M = 15.5, d = 10pc, Av = 3.1×0.4
m = M + 5log(d/10) + Av = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 (too faint for both)

Star5: M = 16.5, d = 5pc
m = M + 5log(d/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 (visible to both)

Answer: Stars 1, 3, and 5 can be detected by both instruments.

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve:
1) PH3 → P + 1.5H2
2) Initial PH3 = 500mL, total = 600mL
3) H2 produced = 300mL
4) In fuel cell: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
5) O2 used = 50mL, so H2 used = 100mL
6) H2 remaining = 300mL - 100mL = 200mL

Answer: 200 mL
