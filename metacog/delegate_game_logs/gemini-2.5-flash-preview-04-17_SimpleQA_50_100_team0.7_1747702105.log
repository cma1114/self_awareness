Delegation to teammate occurred in 90/100 trials (90.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 5/10 (50.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 63/90 (70.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 68 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 68.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 142/396 (35.89%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 5/10 (50.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.9190, p-value = 0.3581
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 70.00%
- Always Self: 35.89%
- Always Teammate: 70.00%
- Random Choice: 52.94%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6633
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 35.89%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6633
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 52.94%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0026
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
