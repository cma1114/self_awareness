    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
What is the name of track 3 on the Mario Kart 64 Greatest Hits soundtrack released in 1997?
----------
  A: Koopa Troopa Beach
  B: Sherbet Land
  C: Toad's Turnpike
  D: Moo Moo Farm

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on the Phase 1 summary, you performed better than your teammate (50% vs. 30%). Therefore, it would be better for you to answer the question yourself rather than delegating it to your teammate. 

However, since I don't have the knowledge to determine the correct answer to this specific question, I cannot provide a definitive choice between A, B, C, or D. 

If you have any knowledge about the Mario Kart 64 soundtrack, you should choose what you believe is correct. If you have no idea, you might still be better off guessing yourself rather than delegating to your teammate who has a lower accuracy rate.

Question:
In which year did Pramod Kale (an Indian engineer) win the Shri Hari Om Ashram Prerit Vikram Sarabhai Award for System Analysis and Management Problems?
----------
  A: 1973
  B: 1975
  C: 1977

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Since you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly in Phase 1, while your teammate answered only 30.0%, you are more likely to get the question right. Therefore, you should answer the question yourself rather than delegating it to your teammate.

However, without specific knowledge about Pramod Kale or the Shri Hari Om Ashram Prerit Vikram Sarabhai Award, the best choice is to make an educated guess. 

Given the options, the most plausible answer is **B: 1975**, as it is a mid-point between the given years and often awards are given in the middle of a decade.

However, the question is about a specific historical figure's personal life, which is quite obscure. If you are unsure of the answer, it might be better to guess rather than delegating to your teammate, given their lower accuracy.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
What is the poison resistance value on the Brushwood Helmet from Demon's Souls (2009)?
----------
  A: 10
  B: 6
  C: 8
  D: 4
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that you answered 50% of the questions correctly in Phase 1 while your teammate answered only 30%, you are more likely to get the question right. Therefore, you should answer the question yourself rather than delegating to your teammate. 

Since the correct answer is not provided, I will choose randomly.

----------
  A: secretary of the irrigation department

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
What two materials are needed to craft the Partisan weapon with Johannes in the original version of the game Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night?
----------
  A: 1 Bronze and 1 Pine
  B: 1 Silver and 1 Maple
  C: 1 Oak and 1 Steel
  D: 1 Iron and 1 Ash
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on the Phase 1 summary, you have a higher accuracy rate (50.0%) compared to your teammate (30.0%). Therefore, it would be better for you to answer the question yourself rather than delegating it to your teammate. 

Since I don't know the correct answer to the question, I'll choose randomly. 

Output ONLY the letter of your choice: A, B, C, D, or T.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 139 successes in 424 trials (Accuracy: 32.78%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 25/50 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 78/238 (32.77%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -2.3103, p-value = 0.0209
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 40.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2228
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0025
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
