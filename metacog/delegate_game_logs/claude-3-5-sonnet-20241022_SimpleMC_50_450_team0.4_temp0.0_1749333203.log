Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on my performance and my teammate's performance in Phase 1, where my teammate got about 16 correct answers out of 50 (32% accuracy) while I'm unsure of my own accuracy, and given that I don't have high confidence in this specific question about the Cape Town Cycle Tour's 1989 length, I will delegate this to my teammate.
