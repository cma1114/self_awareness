In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Potassium hydrogen tartrate forms strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, leading to a crystalline lattice that is difficult to disrupt with water alone. Acid or base disrupts these bonds by protonating or deprotonating the tartrate, respectively, increasing solubility.

Experimentally, measure the solubility of potassium hydrogen tartrate in water, then in acidic and basic solutions.

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Planet 1/Star 1 system. The transit depth is proportional to (Rp/Rs)^2. Planet 1 is 4x larger than Planet 2, but Star 1 is 2x larger than Star 2. Therefore, (Rp1/Rs1)^2 = (4Rp2/2Rs2)^2 = 4(Rp2/Rs2)^2. The transit depth is 4 times greater for Planet 1/Star 1.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 43 successes in 383 trials (Accuracy: 11.23%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 8/50 (15.47%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 10/36 (27.78%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.3245, p-value = 0.1853
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 15.47%
- Always Self: 15.47%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 12.74%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 15.47%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0197
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 15.47%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0197
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3953
