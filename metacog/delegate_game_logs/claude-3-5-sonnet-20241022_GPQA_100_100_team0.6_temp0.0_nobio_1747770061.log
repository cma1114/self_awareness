========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_GPQA_100_100_team0.6_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 60.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 60.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 100
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 42.73%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 43.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 62.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 93/100 trials (93.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 6/7 (85.71%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 56/93 (60.22%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 62 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 62.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 115/269 (42.73%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 6/7 (85.71%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.2616, p-value = 0.0237
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 60.00%
- Always Self: 42.73%
- Always Teammate: 60.00%
- Random Choice: 51.36%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7597
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 42.73%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0002
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7597
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 51.36%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0356
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
