========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.5-flash-lite_GPQA_50_500_team0.0_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 0.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 0.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 397
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 39.60%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 40.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 32.24%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 99/397 trials (24.94%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 128/298 (42.95%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 0/99 (0.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 128 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 32.24%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 20/50 (39.60%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 128/298 (42.95%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.3908, p-value = 0.6959
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 39.60%
- Always Self: 39.60%
- Always Teammate: 0.00%
- Random Choice: 19.80%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 39.60%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0029
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 39.60%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0029
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 0.00%):
    Result: Observed score (32.24%) is greater than the 0% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 0%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly GREATER)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 19.80%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
