========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_SimpleQA_50_450_team0.3_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 30.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 30.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 24.40%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 24.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 34.89%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 276/450 trials (61.33%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 72/174 (41.38%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 85/276 (30.80%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 157 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 34.89%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 12/50 (24.40%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 72/174 (41.38%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.2372, p-value = 0.0253
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 30.00%
- Always Self: 24.40%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 27.20%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0269
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 24.40%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0269
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 27.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0004
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
