In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: KE = 33.9 MeV

The total energy must equal the pion rest mass (139.6 MeV). Using conservation of energy and momentum, we can find the muon's KE = 33.9 MeV.

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 8.8 Earth masses (11 × sin(60°))

The RV method only measures M×sin(i), and for random orbital orientations, the average sin(i) = π/4 ≈ 0.8, so the RV-measured masses will be 80% of true masses.

Chiral phase: 3 peaks

Reaction I gives a single enantiomer alcohol, while Reaction II gives a meso diol. When combined, they'll show as 2 spots on normal phase (different polarities) but 3 on chiral (the meso diol and the two enantiomers of the single alcohol).
