Using simulated Phase 1 results

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering short answer questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 0.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 0.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 0.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 443
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 24.34%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 24.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 3.16%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 387/443 trials (87.36%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 14/56 (25.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 0/387 (0.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 14 successes in 443 trials (Accuracy: 3.16%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 12/50 (24.34%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 14/56 (25.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.1195, p-value = 0.9049
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 24.34%
- Always Self: 24.34%
- Always Teammate: 0.00%
- Random Choice: 12.17%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 24.34%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 24.34%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 0.00%):
    Result: Observed score (3.16%) is greater than the 0% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 0%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly GREATER)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 12.17%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
