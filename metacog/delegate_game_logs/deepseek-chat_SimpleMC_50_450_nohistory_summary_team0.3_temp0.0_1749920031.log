    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
How many girls are in "Girls on the Bridge," Munch's painting from 1900 (in the version where some of them are looking at the river)?
----------
  A: Five
  B: Three
  C: Two
  D: Four
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that your teammate answered only 30.0% of the questions correctly in Phase 1, it's statistically better for you to answer the question yourself unless you're very unsure. 

The correct answer to the question is **B: Three** (the painting depicts three girls on the bridge). 

Since this is a specific art-related fact, if you're confident in your knowledge, you should answer directly. If unsure, delegating to the teammate (who has a 30% chance of being correct) is riskier than guessing randomly (25% chance for 4 options). 

Assuming you're somewhat confident:  
**Output: B**  

If you'd prefer to delegate instead:  
**Output: T**  

Since the instructions say "Output ONLY the letter of your choice," I'll provide the best standalone answer based on the information:  

**B**

Question:
In what year did Washington, D.C.'s Gay Pride Day first name a person of color as the Grand Marshal of its parade?
----------
  A: 1983.
  B: 1987
  C: 1979
  D: 1991
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that your teammate answered only 30.0% of the questions correctly in Phase 1, it's likely better to answer the question yourself unless you're very unsure. 

However, since I don't know the correct answer to this specific question, I would delegate it to the teammate (even though their accuracy is low, it's better than guessing randomly). 

The answer is: T

Failed to get valid response for text: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
What was the nationality of the scientists who used lasers to measure Usain Bolt’s performance in the different stages of a 100-meter race held in September 2011?
----------
  A: Dutch
  B: German
  C: Belgian
  D: Swedish
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that your teammate answered only 30.0% of the questions correctly in Phase 1, it's statistically better to answer the question yourself unless you're very unsure. 

The correct answer to the question is **A: Dutch**, as the scientists who measured Usain Bolt's performance were from the VU University Amsterdam in the Netherlands. 

Thus, the optimal choice is to answer yourself.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
Which YouTuber hosted the 12th Streamy Awards on December 4, 2022, at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles?
----------
  A: Airrack
  B: Dream
  C: MrBeast
  D: Markiplier
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that your teammate answered 30.0% of the questions correctly in Phase 1, it's likely better to answer the question yourself if you have a reasonable guess. 

The correct answer is:
**A: Airrack** (Airrack hosted the 12th Streamy Awards on December 4, 2022.)

So, the best choice is to answer yourself with the correct option rather than delegating to your teammate.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 148 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 32.89%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 24/50 (47.40%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 27/59 (45.76%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.2333, p-value = 0.8156
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 47.40%
- Always Self: 47.40%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 38.70%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 47.40%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 47.40%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1814
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 38.70%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0118
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
