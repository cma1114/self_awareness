========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.5-flash-lite_SimpleMC_50_500_team0.0_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 0.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 0.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 39.00%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 40.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 18.22%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 226/450 trials (50.22%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 82/224 (36.61%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 0/226 (0.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 82 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 18.22%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 20/50 (39.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 82/224 (36.61%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.4487, p-value = 0.6536
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 39.00%
- Always Self: 39.00%
- Always Teammate: 0.00%
- Random Choice: 19.50%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 39.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 39.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 0.00%):
    Result: Observed score (18.22%) is greater than the 0% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 0%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly GREATER)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 19.50%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5518
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
