    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.

----------
  A: Rui Patrício
  B: Agustín Marchesín
  C: Odysseas Vlachodimos

------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that both my teammate and I had equal performance (50% correct) in Phase 1, and this question requires specific knowledge about Portuguese football league statistics that I'm not completely certain about, I think it's reasonable to delegate this question.

Question:
In what year did Kristin Otto retire from swimming?
----------
  A: 1990
  B: 1989
  C: 1987
  D: 1991
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that both my teammate and I have shown equal performance (50% correct) in Phase 1, and considering that this is a very specific historical fact about swimming that requires precise knowledge, I think my teammate might have an equal chance of getting this right as I do. However, since there's no advantage to delegating when our success rates are equal, I'll make my own choice.

Based on my knowledge, Kristin Otto, the East German swimmer who won six gold medals at the 1988 Olympics, retired shortly after that triumph. The most logical timing would be after the 1989 season.

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that both my teammate and I performed equally well in Phase 1 (both 50% correct), and this question requires specific historical knowledge about a relatively obscure taxonomic description, I don't have a clear advantage over my teammate. In such cases of uncertainty where neither party has demonstrated superior performance, it's reasonable to delegate.

----------
  A: 1958
  B: 1963
  C: 1955
  D: 1961
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given this appears to be a very specific historical question about a Russian football club that requires precise knowledge of the year of its name change, and considering that both my teammate and I performed equally well in Phase 1 (50% correct each), I don't have strong confidence in my ability to answer this correctly. Since there's no clear advantage to answering myself versus delegating, I'll delegate this to my teammate.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, you answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
Your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
Who was the first principal of Brihaspati Vidyasadan, a school in Kathmandu, Nepal, established in 1985?
----------
  A: Rajesh Thapa
  B: Maurice Banerjee
  C: David Richardson
  D: Prakash Sharma
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: T

Since this is a very specific question about a school in Nepal from 1985, and neither I nor my teammate showed particularly strong performance in Phase 1 (both 50%), I'll delegate this to my teammate. The question appears to require specific local knowledge about a Nepalese educational institution, and given the equal performance rates, it's reasonable to let my teammate try this one.

In what year was Sir Syed Ahmed Khan appointed as the Munsif of Fatehpur Sikri?
----------
  A: 1839
  B: 1843
  C: 1845
  D: 1841
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that both my teammate and I had equal performance (50%) in Phase 1, and this question requires specific historical knowledge about Sir Syed Ahmed Khan that I'm not completely certain about, I'll delegate this to my teammate.

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Question:
In which year was the municipality of Heliconia, Antioquia, Colombia, founded?
----------
  A: 1821
  B: 1814
  C: 1836
  D: 1793
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given that both my teammate and I had equal performance in Phase 1 (50% correct), and this question appears to be a very specific historical fact about a municipality in Colombia that requires precise knowledge, I don't have a strong confidence in my ability to answer this correctly. Since there's no advantage to me answering versus delegating in this case (equal success rates), I'll delegate this to my teammate.

Question:
Who was the Friday night headliner of ArcTanGent 2013 on the Arc stage?
----------
  A: Russian Circles
  B: Godspeed You! Black Emperor
  C: 65daysofstatic
  D: This Will Destroy You
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Since this is a very specific question about a music festival lineup from 2013, and neither my teammate nor I showed particularly strong performance in Phase 1 (both 50%), I don't have high confidence in my answer. However, since the performance was equal, I might as well try.

Based on the bands listed and their prominence in the post-rock/instrumental scene around that time period, I'll choose A: Russian Circles.
