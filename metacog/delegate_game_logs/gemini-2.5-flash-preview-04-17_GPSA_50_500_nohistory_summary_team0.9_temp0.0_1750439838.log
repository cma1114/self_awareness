    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering short answer questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 90.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Choice registered. Moving to the next question...

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The fundamental state of the diatomic molecule is (v=0, J=0).
According to the selection rules for photon absorption in the rotation-vibration model, allowed transitions from (v=0, J=0) are:
1. Pure rotational transition: Δv=0, ΔJ=+1. This leads to the state (v=0, J=1).
2. Vibration-rotation transition: Δv=+1, ΔJ=+1 (since J=0, ΔJ=-1 is not possible). This leads to the state (v=1, J=1).

We need to find the energy of these two possible transitions from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) and identify the one with the lowest energy.

The energy levels in the rotation-vibration model are given by E(v, J) = h c G(v, J), where G(v, J) = ω_e (v + 1/2) + B_e J(J + 1) - α_e (v + 1/2) J(J + 1) - D_e J^2(J + 1)^2 + ...
ω_e is the vibrational constant (cm^-1), B_e is the rotational constant (cm^-1), α_e is the vibration-rotation coupling constant (cm^-1), and D_e is the centrifugal distortion constant (cm^-1).

The energy of the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) is E(0, 0) = h c [ω_e (1/2)].

The energy of the state (v=0, J=1) is E(0, 1) = h c [ω_e (1/2) + B_e (1)(2) - α_e (1/2)(1)(2) - D_e (1)^2(2)^2] = h c [ω_e/2 + 2 B_e - α_e - 4 D_e].
The energy difference for the transition (0,0) -> (0,1) is ΔE(0,1) = E(0,1) - E(0,0) = h c [2 B_e - α_e - 4 D_e].

The energy of the state (v=1, J=1) is E(1, 1) = h c [ω_e (3/2) + B_e (1)(2) - α_e (3/2)(1)(2) - D_e (1)^2(2)^2] = h c [3 ω_e/2 + 2 B_e - 3 α_e - 4 D_e].
The energy difference for the transition (0,0) -> (1,1) is ΔE(1,1) = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = h c [ω_e + 2 B_e - 3 α_e - 4 D_e].

We are given the vibrational angular frequency ω = 4*10^14 rad/s. The energy associated with this is h ω. This corresponds approximately to the energy difference between vibrational levels, h c ω_e.
h ω = (6.626 * 10^-34 J s) * (4 * 10^14 rad/s) ≈ 2.650 * 10^-19 J.
This energy corresponds to ω_e ≈ (2.650 * 10^-19 J) / (6.626 * 10^-34 J s * 2.998 * 10^10 cm/s) ≈ 1334 cm^-1.

The rotational constant B_e is calculated from the moment of inertia I = μ R^2.
Reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu.
μ = (20/11) * 1.6605 * 10^-27 kg ≈ 3.019 * 10^-27 kg.
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2 * 10^-10 m.
Moment of inertia I = (3.019 * 10^-27 kg) * (2 * 10^-10 m)^2 = 1.2076 * 10^-46 kg m^2.
B_e (in cm^-1) = h / (8 π^2 I c) = (6.626 * 10^-34 J s) / (8 * π^2 * 1.2076 * 10^-46 kg m^2 * 2.998 * 10^10 cm/s) ≈ 2.318 cm^-1.

Comparing the energy differences:
ΔE(0,1) = h c [2 B_e - α_e - 4 D_e]
ΔE(1,1) = h c [ω_e + 2 B_e - 3 α_e - 4 D_e]

Since ω_e (≈ 1334 cm^-1) is much larger than B_e (≈ 2.318 cm^-1), α_e, and D_e, the energy difference for the vibration-rotation transition ΔE(1,1) will be much larger than for the pure rotational transition ΔE(0,1).
Therefore, the "next state with the lowest possible energy" accessible from (v=0, J=0) by absorbing a photon is the (v=0, J=1) state.

The energy of the absorbed photon is ΔE(0,1). Since values for α_e and D_e are not provided, we use the rigid rotor approximation for the rotational energy, which means ignoring α_e and D_e.
ΔE ≈ 2 h c B_e
ΔE ≈ 2 * (6.626 * 10^-34 J s) * (2.998 * 10^10 cm/s) * (2.318 cm^-1)
ΔE ≈ 2 * (1.986 * 10^-23 J cm) * (2.318 cm^-1)
ΔE ≈ 9.195 * 10^-23 J.

The momentum of the absorbed photon is p = ΔE / c.
p = (9.195 * 10^-23 J) / (2.998 * 10^8 m/s)
p ≈ 3.067 * 10^-31 kg m/s.

Rounding to 3 significant figures based on the input data precision:
p ≈ 3.07 * 10^-31 kg m/s.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 133 successes in 392 trials (Accuracy: 33.93%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 17/50 (34.84%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 70/325 (21.54%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -1.9434, p-value = 0.0520
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 90.00%
- Always Self: 34.84%
- Always Teammate: 90.00%
- Random Choice: 62.42%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 90.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 34.84%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7505
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 90.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 62.42%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
