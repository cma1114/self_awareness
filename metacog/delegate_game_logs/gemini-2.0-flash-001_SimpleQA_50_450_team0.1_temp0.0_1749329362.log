========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.0-flash-001_SimpleQA_50_450_team0.1_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 10.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 10.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 443
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 24.34%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 24.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 12.64%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 368/443 trials (83.07%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 18/75 (24.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 38/368 (10.33%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 56 successes in 443 trials (Accuracy: 12.64%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 12/50 (24.34%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 18/75 (24.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.0000, p-value = 1.0000
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 24.34%
- Always Self: 24.34%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 17.17%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 24.34%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 24.34%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0683
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 17.17%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0116
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
