In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The insolubility of potassium hydrogen tartrate stems from its limited ability to form stabilizing hydrogen bonds with water compared to the fully protonated or deprotonated forms.  The hydrogen tartrate anion has a more localized charge distribution, making it less effective at interacting with polar water molecules.  This can be experimentally verified by measuring the solubility of the three compounds (tartaric acid, potassium hydrogen tartrate, and potassium tartrate) in water at various pH levels.  Increased solubility at lower and higher pH would confirm the role of protonation/deprotonation in solubility

========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-1.5-pro_GPSA_50_500_team0.4_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 40.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 40.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 397
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 15.44%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 16.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 15.62%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 44/397 trials (11.08%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 44/353 (12.46%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 18/44 (40.91%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 62 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 15.62%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 8/50 (15.44%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 44/353 (12.46%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.6979, p-value = 0.4852
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 40.00%
- Always Self: 15.44%
- Always Teammate: 40.00%
- Random Choice: 27.72%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 15.44%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.8897
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 27.72%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
