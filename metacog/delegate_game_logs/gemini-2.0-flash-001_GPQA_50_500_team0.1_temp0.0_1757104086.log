========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.0-flash-001_GPQA_50_500_team0.1_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 10.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 10.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 397
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 44.52%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 44.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 20.15%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 315/397 trials (79.35%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 48/82 (58.54%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 32/315 (10.16%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 80 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 20.15%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 22/50 (44.52%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 48/82 (58.54%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.6233, p-value = 0.1045
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 44.52%
- Always Self: 44.52%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 27.26%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 44.52%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 44.52%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 27.26%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0013
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
