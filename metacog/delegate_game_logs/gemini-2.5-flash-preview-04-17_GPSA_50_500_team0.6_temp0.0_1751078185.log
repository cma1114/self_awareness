In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The given metric is $ds^{2}=\frac{32}{\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\right)}\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\right)$.
To find the area, we need to integrate the area element $dA = \sqrt{\det(g_{ij})} dx dy$.
The metric tensor $g_{ij}$ for this 2D metric is diagonal, with $g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$.
So, $\det(g_{ij}) = \left(\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\right)^2$.
The area element is $dA = \sqrt{\left(\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\right)^2} dx dy = \frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} dx dy$.

The term "pseudosphere of radius r=2" implies that the domain of integration is the disk $x^2+y^2 < 2^2 = 4$.
It is convenient to convert to polar coordinates: $x = \rho \cos\phi$, $y = \rho \sin\phi$, so $x^2+y^2 = \rho^2$, and $dx dy = \rho d\rho d\phi$.
The area integral becomes:
$A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4-\rho^2} \rho d\rho d\phi$

First, evaluate the inner integral with respect to $\rho$:
$\int_0^2 \frac{32\rho}{4-\rho^2} d\rho$
Let $u = 4-\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\rho d\rho$, so $\rho d\rho = -\frac{1}{2} du$.
When $\rho=0$, $u=4$. When $\rho=2$, $u=0$.
The integral becomes:
$\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \left(-\frac{1}{2} du\right) = \int_0^4 \frac{16}{u} du$

This is an improper integral:
$\lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \int_\epsilon^4 \frac{16}{u} du = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} [16 \ln|u|]_\epsilon^4$
$= \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} (16 \ln 4 - 16 \ln \epsilon)$
As $\epsilon \to 0^+$, $\ln \epsilon \to -\infty$.
Therefore, the integral diverges to $+\infty$.

Since the inner integral diverges, the total area is infinite.
It's worth noting that a true pseudosphere (a surface of constant negative Gaussian curvature) has a finite area ($2\pi R^2$ for a pseudosphere of radius $R$). However, the given metric $ds^{2}=\frac{32}{\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\right)}\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\right)$ does not have constant Gaussian curvature. Its Gaussian curvature is $K = -\frac{1}{4(4-x^2-y^2)}$, which varies with $x$ and $y$. The question likely refers to the area of the surface defined by this specific metric over the disk of radius 2.

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The transition from $|3,0,0\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\rangle$ cannot occur via a single electric dipole transition because the selection rule $\Delta l = \pm 1$ is violated (here $\Delta l = 0$). Therefore, it must occur via a two-step dipole transition.

The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:
1.  $\Delta l = \pm 1$
2.  $\Delta m = 0, \pm 1$

Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\rangle$.

**Step 1: $|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |n', l', m'\rangle$**
From $|3,0,0\rangle$ (a 3s state), $l=0$. For a dipole transition, $l'$ must be $1$.
Since it's a decay, $n'$ must be less than $n=3$. The only possible $n'$ for $l'=1$ is $n'=2$ (i.e., a 2p state, as $l < n$).
So, the intermediate state must be a $|2,1,m'\rangle$ state.
For $m'$, since the initial $m=0$, $\Delta m = 0, \pm 1$ means $m'$ can be $0, 1, \text{ or } -1$.
Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\rangle$, $|2,1,1\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\rangle$.

**Step 2: $|2,1,m'\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle$**
From $|2,1,m'\rangle$ (a 2p state), $l'=1$. For a dipole transition, the final $l$ must be $0$. This matches the final state $|1,0,0\rangle$ (a 1s state).
For $m'$, since the final $m=0$, $\Delta m = 0, \pm 1$ means transitions from $m'=0, 1, \text{ or } -1$ are allowed.

Therefore, the general transition route is:
$|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,m'\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle$

To find the "corresponding probability", we consider the relative probabilities of the angular parts of the transitions, as the radial matrix elements are common for all paths through the 2p intermediate states. The probability of an electric dipole transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator $\mathbf{r}$. The angular part of this matrix element involves spherical harmonics.

The squared angular matrix elements for the first step ($l=0 \rightarrow l'=1$):
*   For $\Delta m = 0$ (i.e., $|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle$): $|\langle Y_{10} | z | Y_{00} \rangle|^2 = 1/3$.
*   For $\Delta m = \pm 1$ (i.e., $|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,\pm 1\rangle$): $|\langle Y_{1,\pm 1} | (x \pm iy)/\sqrt{2} | Y_{00} \rangle|^2 = 1/2$.

The squared angular matrix elements for the second step ($l'=1 \rightarrow l=0$):
*   For $\Delta m = 0$ (i.e., $|2,1,0\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle$): $|\langle Y_{00} | z | Y_{10} \rangle|^2 = 1/3$.
*   For $\Delta m = \pm 1$ (i.e., $|2,1,\pm 1\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle$): $|\langle Y_{00} | (x \mp iy)/\sqrt{2} | Y_{1,\pm 1} \rangle|^2 = 1/2$.

Now, we normalize these probabilities for each step.
For the first step, the total relative probability is $1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 4/3$.
*   $P(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle) = (1/3) / (4/3) = 1/4$.
*   $P(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,1\rangle) = (1/2) / (4/3) = 3/8$.
*   $P(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,-1\rangle) = (1/2) / (4/3) = 3/8$.

For the second step, the total relative probability is $1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 4/3$.
*   $P(|2,1,0\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle) = (1/3) / (4/3) = 1/4$.
*   $P(|2,1,1\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle) = (1/2) / (4/3) = 3/8$.
*   $P(|2,1,-1\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle) = (1/2) / (4/3) = 3/8$.

The probability of each specific two-step route is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps:
1.  Route: $|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle$
    Probability: $(1/4) \times (1/4) = 1/16$.
2.  Route: $|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,1\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle$
    Probability: $(3/8) \times (3/8) = 9/64$.
3.  Route: $|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,-1\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle$
    Probability: $(3/8) \times (3/8) = 9/64$.

The question asks for "the transition route and the corresponding probability". This implies the total probability of the overall two-step process, considering all possible intermediate $m'$ states. This is the sum of the probabilities of all specific routes:
Total Probability = $1/16 + 9/64 + 9/64 = 4/64 + 9/64 + 9/64 = 22/64 = 11/32$.

The transition route: $|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,m'\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle$
The corresponding probability: $11/32$

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson generated by radiative corrections is typically proportional to a loop factor and a relevant mass scale. In this model, the heavy right-handed neutrinos $N_R$ acquire a Majorana mass $M_N = y_i x$ from the VEV of the singlet scalar $\phi$. The interaction term $-g_{i\alpha}\bar{N}_{iR}L_{\alpha}S$ couples these heavy neutrinos to the scalar doublet $S$ and lepton doublets $L_\alpha$.

If $H_2$ is a pseudo-Goldstone boson (e.g., a Majoron) whose mass is generated by loops involving these heavy neutrinos, its mass would be approximately:

$m_{H_2} \sim \frac{g_{i\alpha} y_i}{4\pi} x$

--> Your answer: *   **Step 1: 2-methylpropan-1-ol + K2Cr2O4 / H2SO4 ---> A**
    2-methylpropan-1-ol is a primary alcohol. Strong oxidation yields a carboxylic acid.
    A = 2-methylpropanoic acid ((CH3)2CH-COOH)

*   **Step 2: A + LiOH ---> B**
    Acid-base reaction.
    B = Lithium 2-methylpropanoate ((CH3)2CH-COOLi)

*   **Step 3: B + Lithium propan-2-ide ---> C**
    Lithium propan-2-ide refers to isopropyl lithium ((CH3)2CHLi). Reaction of a carboxylate with an organolithium reagent (two equivalents effectively) followed by hydrolysis yields a ketone. The intermediate C is the dilithium alkoxide.
    C = (CH3)2CH-C(OLi)2-CH(CH3)2

*   **Step 4: C + H3O+, H2O, Heat ---> D**
    Hydrolysis of the dilithium alkoxide intermediate yields the ketone.
    D = 2,4-dimethylpentan-3-one ((CH3)2CH-CO-CH(CH3)2)

*   **Step 5: D + Dimethylamine + H+ ---> E**
    Reaction of a ketone with a secondary amine (dimethylamine) in the presence of acid forms an enamine. The alpha-carbons of 2,4-dimethylpentan-3-one are the methine carbons of the isopropyl groups. The double bond forms between the carbonyl carbon and one of these alpha carbons, with the loss of a proton from the alpha carbon.
    E = 3-(dimethylamino)-2,4-dimethylpent-2-ene ((CH3)2CH-C(=C(CH3)2)-N(CH3)2)

**Theoretical 1H-NMR data for E (3-(dimethylamino)-2,4-dimethylpent-2-ene):**

The molecule has the structure:
      CH3
      |
(CH3)2CH - C = C - N(CH3)2
          |
          CH3

There are four distinct sets of protons:

1.  **6H, singlet (s), ~2.2-2.8 ppm:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom (-N(CH3)2).
2.  **1H, septet (sept), ~1.8-2.5 ppm:** The methine proton (-CH-) of the isopropyl group ((CH3)2CH-). It is coupled to the six equivalent methyl protons of the same isopropyl group.
3.  **6H, singlet (s), ~1.6-2.0 ppm:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (=C(CH3)2).
4.  **6H, doublet (d), ~0.8-1.2 ppm:** The six equivalent methyl protons of the isopropyl group ((CH3)2CH-). They are coupled to the adjacent methine proton.

**Summary of 1H-NMR data:**
*   **6H, s, ~2.5 ppm** (N-CH3)
*   **1H, sept, ~2.0 ppm** (CH of isopropyl)
*   **6H, s, ~1.7 ppm** (C=C-CH3)
*   **6H, d, ~1.0 ppm** (CH3 of isopropyl)

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Potassium Hydrogen Tartrate (KHT) is insoluble due to the ability of the hydrogen tartrate ion (HT-) to form a stable, extensive hydrogen-bonded network in the solid state, leading to high lattice energy. The fully protonated tartaric acid (H2T) and the fully deprotonated potassium tartrate (K2T) are more soluble because their respective forms (neutral molecule and fully charged ion) are more readily solvated by water, overcoming their lattice energies.

Experimental verification:
1.  Compare the measured solubilities of KHT, tartaric acid, and potassium tartrate in water.
2.  Demonstrate that KHT dissolves upon the addition of either acid or base to its suspension in water

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 1.  **Identify the metal:** The metal is amphoteric and one of the most abundant in the Earth's crust. This points to Aluminum (Al).

2.  **Decomposition of KClO3:**
    The balanced equation for the decomposition of KClO3 is:
    2 KClO3(s) → 2 KCl(s) + 3 O2(g)
    Molar mass of KClO3 = 39.1 + 35.45 + 3*16 = 122.55 g/mol
    Moles of KClO3 = 49 g / 122.55 g/mol ≈ 0.400 mol
    From the stoichiometry, moles of O2 produced = (3/2) * 0.400 mol = 0.600 mol O2.

3.  **Reaction of O2 with impure metal (Aluminum):**
    The mass of impure metal is 10.8 g, and its purity is 20%.
    Mass of pure Aluminum = 10.8 g * 0.20 = 2.16 g
    Molar mass of Al = 26.98 g/mol
    Moles of Al = 2.16 g / 26.98 g/mol ≈ 0.080 mol Al
    The reaction of Aluminum with Oxygen is:
    4 Al(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Al2O3(s)
    To react completely with 0.080 mol of Al, moles of O2 needed = (3/4) * 0.080 mol = 0.060 mol O2.
    Since 0.060 mol O2 is less than the 0.600 mol O2 available, Aluminum is the limiting reactant.
    Moles of Al2O3 formed = (2/4) * 0.080 mol = 0.040 mol Al2O3.

4.  **Conversion of metal oxide back to pure metal using carbon:**
    The metal oxide is Al2O3. The reduction of Al2O3 by carbon can be represented as:
    Al2O3(s) + 3 C(s) → 2 Al(s) + 3 CO(g)
    From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Al2O3 requires 3 moles of C.
    Moles of C needed = 3 * 0.040 mol = 0.120 mol C.
    Molar mass of C = 12.01 g/mol
    Mass of C needed = 0.120 mol * 12.01 g/mol ≈ 1.44 g.

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The problem asks for the "upper limit of the variance of any parameter $\gamma$", which it defines as "the inverse of the square root of its quantum Fisher information". This means we need to calculate $1/\sqrt{F_Q(\gamma)}$.

The given Hamiltonian is $H = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.5 + \gamma \\ 0.5 - \gamma & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
For a Hamiltonian to represent a physical observable in quantum mechanics, it must be Hermitian. A matrix $M$ is Hermitian if $M = M^\dagger$, which means $M_{ij} = M_{ji}^*$.
For the given Hamiltonian, $H_{12} = 0.5 + \gamma$ and $H_{21} = 0.5 - \gamma$.
For Hermiticity, $H_{12} = H_{21}^*$. Since $0.5+\gamma$ and $0.5-\gamma$ are real, this implies $0.5+\gamma = 0.5-\gamma$, which means $\gamma = 0$.
However, the problem states that $\gamma$ can take any value in the range $[0,1]$. This indicates that the Hamiltonian as written is not Hermitian for $\gamma \ne 0$.

If the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, its eigenvalues can be complex, and the standard interpretation of quantum Fisher information might not apply directly, or it might lead to non-physical results (e.g., negative or imaginary QFI).
For the given non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, the eigenvalues are $\lambda = \pm \sqrt{(0.5+\gamma)(0.5-\gamma)} = \pm \sqrt{0.25 - \gamma^2}$.
For $\gamma > 0.5$, the eigenvalues become imaginary, and the quantity $0.25-\gamma^2$ becomes negative. If this quantity appears in the denominator or under a square root in the QFI, it would lead to an imaginary QFI, which is not physically meaningful.

It is highly probable that there is a typo in the problem statement and the Hamiltonian was intended to be Hermitian. The most common way to make the off-diagonal elements $A$ and $B$ Hermitian ($A=B^*$) while keeping them related to $0.5$ and $\gamma$ is to have them as complex conjugates.
Let's assume the intended Hamiltonian is $H = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.5 + i\gamma \\ 0.5 - i\gamma & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. This Hamiltonian is Hermitian.

For this Hermitian Hamiltonian:
1.  **Eigenvalues:**
    The characteristic equation is $(-\lambda)(-\lambda) - (0.5+i\gamma)(0.5-i\gamma) = 0$
    $\lambda^2 - (0.25 + \gamma^2) = 0$
    $\lambda = \pm \sqrt{0.25 + \gamma^2}$. Let $E_1 = \sqrt{0.25 + \gamma^2}$ and $E_2 = -\sqrt{0.25 + \gamma^2}$. These are real for all $\gamma$.

2.  **Parameter Generator:**
    The Hamiltonian can be written as $H(\gamma) = H_0 + \gamma G$, where $H_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.5 \\ 0.5 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $G = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
    The generator of the parameter $\gamma$ is $G = \partial_\gamma H$.

3.  **Quantum Fisher Information (QFI):**
    For a pure state $|\psi\rangle$ that is an eigenstate of $H(\gamma)$, the QFI for a parameter $\gamma$ encoded in the Hamiltonian $H(\gamma)$ is given by $F_Q = 4 (\langle \psi | G^2 | \psi \rangle - \langle \psi | G | \psi \rangle^2)$, where $G = \partial_\gamma H$.
    First, calculate $G^2$:
    $G^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (-i)(i) & 0 \\ 0 & (-i)(i) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = I$.
    So, $\langle \psi | G^2 | \psi \rangle = \langle \psi | I | \psi \rangle = 1$ (since $|\psi\rangle$ is normalized).

    Next, find an eigenvector of $H(\gamma)$. For $E_1 = \sqrt{0.25 + \gamma^2}$:
    $\begin{pmatrix} -\sqrt{0.25 + \gamma^2} & 0.5 + i\gamma \\ 0.5 - i\gamma & -\sqrt{0.25 + \gamma^2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$
    From the first row: $-\sqrt{0.25 + \gamma^2} v_1 + (0.5+i\gamma) v_2 = 0 \implies v_1 = \frac{0.5+i\gamma}{\sqrt{0.25 + \gamma^2}} v_2$.
    Let $v_2 = \sqrt{0.25 + \gamma^2}$. Then $v_1 = 0.5+i\gamma$.
    The unnormalized eigenvector is $\begin{pmatrix} 0.5+i\gamma \\ \sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2} \end{pmatrix}$.
    The normalization constant is $N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|0.5+i\gamma|^2 + (\sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2})^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(0.25+\gamma^2) + (0.25+\gamma^2)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(0.25+\gamma^2)}}$.
    So, $|\psi_1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(0.25+\gamma^2)}} \begin{pmatrix} 0.5+i\gamma \\ \sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2} \end{pmatrix}$.

    Now calculate $\langle \psi_1 | G | \psi_1 \rangle$:
    $\langle \psi_1 | G | \psi_1 \rangle = \frac{1}{2(0.25+\gamma^2)} \begin{pmatrix} 0.5-i\gamma & \sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0.5+i\gamma \\ \sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2} \end{pmatrix}$
    $= \frac{1}{2(0.25+\gamma^2)} \begin{pmatrix} 0.5-i\gamma & \sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} i\sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2} \\ -i(0.5+i\gamma) \end{pmatrix}$
    $= \frac{1}{2(0.25+\gamma^2)} [ (0.5-i\gamma)(i\sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2}) + \sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2}(-i(0.5+i\gamma)) ]$
    $= \frac{i\sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2}}{2(0.25+\gamma^2)} [ (0.5-i\gamma) - (0.5+i\gamma) ]$
    $= \frac{i}{2\sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2}} [ -2i\gamma ] = \frac{2\gamma}{2\sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2}} = \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2}}$.

    Finally, substitute into the QFI formula:
    $F_Q = 4 \left( 1 - \left(\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2}}\right)^2 \right)$
    $F_Q = 4 \left( 1 - \frac{\gamma^2}{0.25+\gamma^2} \right)$
    $F_Q = 4 \left( \frac{0.25+\gamma^2 - \gamma^2}{0.25+\gamma^2} \right)$
    $F_Q = 4 \left( \frac{0.25}{0.25+\gamma^2} \right) = \frac{1}{0.25+\gamma^2}$.

4.  **Upper limit of the variance:**
    The problem defines this as $1/\sqrt{F_Q}$.
    $1/\sqrt{F_Q} = 1/\sqrt{\frac{1}{0.25+\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2}$.

The final answer is $\boxed{\sqrt{0.25+\gamma^2}}$

--> Your answer: 1. Calculate the luminosity of each star:
Luminosity (L) is proportional to R²T⁴.
Let L_A be the luminosity of Star A and L_B be the luminosity of Star B.
L_A ∝ (1 R_sun)² * (6000 K)⁴ = 1 * (6000)⁴ = 1.296 × 10¹⁵ (arbitrary units)
L_B ∝ (0.5 R_sun)² * (4000 K)⁴ = 0.25 * (4000)⁴ = 0.25 * 2.56 × 10¹⁴ = 0.064 × 10¹⁵ (arbitrary units)

For simplicity, let's use L_A = 1296 and L_B = 64 (by dividing by 10¹²).

2. Determine the maximum brightness of the system:
The maximum brightness occurs when no eclipses or transits are happening.
Max_Brightness = L_A + L_B = 1296 + 64 = 1360 units.

3. Determine the minimum brightness of the system:
We need to consider all possible eclipse/transit scenarios and find the one that results in the lowest brightness.

a) Star A eclipses Star B: Star B's light is completely blocked.
Brightness = L_A = 1296 units.
(Drop = L_B = 64 units)

b) Star B eclipses Star A: Star B is smaller than Star A. The fraction of Star A's area blocked is (R_B / R_A)² = (0.5 / 1)² = 0.25.
Light blocked from Star A = 0.25 * L_A = 0.25 * 1296 = 324 units.
Brightness = (L_A - 324) + L_B = (1296 - 324) + 64 = 972 + 64 = 1036 units.
(Drop = 324 units)

c) Planet transits Star A: The fraction of Star A's area blocked is (R_planet / R_A)² = (0.1 / 1)² = 0.01.
Light blocked from Star A = 0.01 * L_A = 0.01 * 1296 = 12.96 units.
Brightness = (L_A - 12.96) + L_B = (1296 - 12.96) + 64 = 1283.04 + 64 = 1347.04 units.

d) Planet transits Star B: The fraction of Star B's area blocked is (R_planet / R_B)² = (0.1 / 0.5)² = (0.2)² = 0.04.
Light blocked from Star B = 0.04 * L_B = 0.04 * 64 = 2.56 units.
Brightness = L_A + (L_B - 2.56) = 1296 + (64 - 2.56) = 1296 + 61.44 = 1357.44 units.

Comparing the brightness values from all scenarios:
- Max_Brightness = 1360 units.
- Min_Brightness = 1036 units (when Star B eclipses Star A, causing the largest drop in total light).

4. Calculate the maximum factor of brightness variation:
Factor = Max_Brightness / Min_Brightness = 1360 / 1036 ≈ 1.3127

--> Your answer: The relationship among the alleles is that the A1 allele is dominant for short tail, and the A2 allele is recessive for long tail. This is inferred from the observation that all offspring are short-tailed, despite one parent being homozygous for A1 (long tail) and the initial description stating A1 is recessive for long tail. The unexpected result implies that the A1A1 genotype in the offspring produces a short tail
