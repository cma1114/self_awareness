Initial Setup Explanation: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In both phases, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    
Using 100 questions for phase 1 and 200 for phase 2

========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_GPQA_0.7_0.7_100_200
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 70.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 70.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 100
Number of Trials Phase2: 200
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 50.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 71.50%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 127/200 trials (63.50%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 54/73 (73.97%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 89/127 (70.08%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 143 successes in 200 trials (Accuracy: 71.50%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy: 50/100 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 54/73 (73.97%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 3.1802, p-value = 0.0015
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 70.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 70.00%
- Random Choice: 60.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6998
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6998
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0009
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
