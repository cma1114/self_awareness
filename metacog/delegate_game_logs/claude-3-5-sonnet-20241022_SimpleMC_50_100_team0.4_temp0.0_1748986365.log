- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 58.20%
- Always Self: 58.20%
- Always Teammate: 40.00%
- Random Choice: 49.10%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0001
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0001
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7597
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 49.10%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0278
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
