1) G2 knockout alone eliminates resistance (0%)
2) Any double mutant with G2 also shows 0% resistance
3) G1 and G3 show partial effects, suggesting they're downstream targets

1) T ∝ 1/√a where a is orbital distance
2) P² ∝ a³ (Kepler's Third Law)
3) T₁/T₂ = 1.4 and T₂/T₃ = 2.3
4) Therefore T₁/T₃ = 3.22
5) This means a₃/a₁ = 10.4
6) Therefore P₃/P₁ = (10.4)^(3/2) = 33.5

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 71.1 days

The 28.1 day signal matches the star's rotation period (based on activity indicators Ha and CaII), and its harmonics would produce the other shorter periods. Therefore, the 71.1 day signal, being independent of the stellar rotation period and its harmonics, is most likely to be the planetary signal.
