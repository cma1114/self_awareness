========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.0-flash-001_GPQA_50_400_team0.4_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 40.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 40.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 397
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 43.18%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 44.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 45.09%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 302/397 trials (76.07%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 58/95 (61.05%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 121/302 (40.07%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 179 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 45.09%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 22/50 (43.18%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 58/95 (61.05%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.9625, p-value = 0.0497
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 43.18%
- Always Self: 43.18%
- Always Teammate: 40.00%
- Random Choice: 41.59%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 43.18%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4476
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 43.18%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4476
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0404
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 41.59%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1691
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
