In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Akt and S6K appear to transmit the majority of the effect on cell proliferation and survival in MCF7 cells based on the data provided.

The conditions that show the greatest reduction in live cell percentage (7, 8, 10, 11, 13) all have complete inhibition of Akt phosphorylation (pSer473 and pThr308) and S6K phosphorylation (pThr389). In contrast, conditions that maintain Akt and S6K phosphorylation (4, 5, 6) show less reduction in live cell percentage.

This suggests that inhibition of both Akt and S6K is critical for reducing MCF7 cell proliferation and survival, indicating these are the key kinases transmitting the effects of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in this cell line

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: G2 is likely the transcription factor that acts upstream of G1 and G3. The results show that the g2 mutant has the lowest resistance, indicating G2 is the most important for resistance. The double mutants g1g3, g2g3, and g1g2 all have very low resistance, suggesting G1 and G3 act downstream of G2
