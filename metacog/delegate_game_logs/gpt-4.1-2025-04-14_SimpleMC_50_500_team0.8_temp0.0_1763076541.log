========== Phase 2 Complete ==========
Delegation to teammate occurred in 105/450 trials (23.33%).
Your final score in Phase 2: 258/450 (57.33%)
========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14_SimpleMC_50_500_team0.8_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 80.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 80.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 53.40%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 54.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 57.33%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 105/450 trials (23.33%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 172/345 (49.86%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 86/105 (81.90%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 258 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 57.33%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 27/50 (53.40%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 172/345 (49.86%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.5478, p-value = 0.5838
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 53.40%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 66.70%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 53.40%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0982
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 66.70%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
