========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gpt-4o-2024-08-06_SimpleMC_50_500_team0.8_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 80.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 80.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 48.20%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 48.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 18.44%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 334/450 trials (74.22%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 83 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 18.44%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 24/50 (48.20%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 75/116 (64.66%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.0066, p-value = 0.0448
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 48.20%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 64.10%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 48.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 64.10%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
