In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.\n    Don't be afraid to give an answer if you think you might know it!\n    \n\n========== Starting Phase 1: Answer the Questions ==========\n------------------------------\nQuestion 1/50:\nHow many children did Robert Moog and his first wife, Shirley May Leigh, have?\n----------\n------------------------------\nYour answer: "
