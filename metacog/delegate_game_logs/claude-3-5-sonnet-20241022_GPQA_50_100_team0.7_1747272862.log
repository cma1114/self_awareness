Question 1/100:
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

Question 9/100:
A researcher observes at his laboratory that a muon travels a distance of 1000m after its creation to its disintegration.  If the average lifetime of a muon is $2 \times 10^{-6} sec$ then what is the speed of the muon observed by the researcher in the laboratory, assuming the muon lives exactly the averaged lifetime?

  A: 257247878 m/s
  B: 278394987 m/s
  C: 500000000 m/s

Question 15/100:
Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. 
The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

What Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?
----------
  A: 54
  B: 40
  C: 68
  D: 28
