Using simulated Phase 1 results

    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering short answer questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Potassium Hydrogen Tartrate (KHT) is insoluble because the hydrogen tartrate anion (HT-) can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, creating a stable crystal lattice that is difficult for water to break apart. Tartaric acid (H2T) is a neutral molecule, and potassium tartrate (K2T) contains the highly charged tartrate anion (T2-), both of which interact more favorably with water.

Experimental verification: Add acid to a KHT suspension; it dissolves forming soluble tartaric acid. Add base to a KHT suspension; it dissolves forming soluble potassium tartrate.

Using integer atomic masses (N=14, H=1, O=16, C=12):
Products of 1): 2 * M(N₂) + 6 * M(H₂O) = 2 * (2*14) + 6 * (2*1 + 16) = 2 * 28 + 6 * 18 = 56 + 108 = 164
Products of 2): 1 * M(CO₂) + 2 * M(H₂O) = 1 * (12 + 2*16) + 2 * (2*1 + 16) = 1 * 44 + 2 * 18 = 44 + 36 = 80

Delegation to teammate occurred in 30/392 trials (7.65%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 81/362 (22.38%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 16/30 (53.33%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 97 successes in 392 trials (Accuracy: 24.74%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 17/50 (34.84%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 81/362 (22.38%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -1.8096, p-value = 0.0704
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 34.84%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 42.42%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 34.84%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 42.42%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
