Initial Setup Explanation: 
Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
The game consists of two phases:
1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently and receive feedback on your performance.
2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

Question 1:
A coating is applied to a substrate resulting in a perfectly smooth surface. The measured static contact angles of this smooth coating are 104° and 76° for water and oil respectively. The coating formulation is then modified and when now applied to the same type of substrate, a rough surface is produced. For the rough surface, the advancing and receding water contact angles are measured to be 133° and 125° respectively. What would be the best estimate of the static water and static oil contact angles of the rough surface, and would water droplets roll off of the surface at low or high tilt angles. 
----------
  A: Water = 128°, Oil = 48°, high tilt angle
  B: Water = 129°, Oil = 98°, low tilt angle
  C: Water = 129°, Oil = 98°, high tilt angle
  D: Water = 128°, Oil = 48°, low tilt angle
