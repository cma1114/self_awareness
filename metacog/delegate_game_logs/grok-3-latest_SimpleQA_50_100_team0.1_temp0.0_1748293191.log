(REASONING: BASED ON PHASE 1 PERFORMANCE, I GOT SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT MUNICIPALITY FOUNDING YEARS INCORRECT, INCLUDING THOSE IN COLOMBIA. MY TEAMMATE ALSO STRUGGLED WITH SIMILAR QUESTIONS, BUT SINCE MY TRACK RECORD ON THESE SPECIFIC TOPICS ISN'T STRONG, I’LL DELEGATE TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER GUESS OR KNOWLEDGE ON THIS ONE.)

REASON: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE AND I HAVE BOTH STRUGGLED WITH SPECIFIC PERSONAL DETAILS LIKE NAMES IN HISTORICAL OR NICHE CONTEXTS. SINCE MY TRACK RECORD ON SUCH QUESTIONS ISN'T SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER, AND CONSIDERING THE TEAMMATE GOT A FEW CORRECT ANSWERS IN AREAS I MISSED, I’LL DELEGATE THIS TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO POTENTIALLY GET IT RIGHT.

REASONING: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE GOT A FEW QUESTIONS CORRECT IN SPECIALIZED AREAS, AND I HAVE NO SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OR CONFIDENCE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR AWARD OR RECIPIENT. SINCE MY ACCURACY RATE WAS HIGHER IN PHASE 1 (17 CORRECT OUT OF 50 COMPARED TO MY TEAMMATE'S 5 CORRECT OUT OF 50), I WOULD TYPICALLY ANSWER MYSELF. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE NICHE NATURE OF PHOTOGRAPHY AWARDS, WHICH NEITHER OF US DEMONSTRATED STRENGTH IN DURING PHASE 1, I’LL DELEGATE TO MY TEAMMATE TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT HAVE AN EDGE OR A LUCKY GUESS ON THIS TOPIC. IF I WERE TO ANSWER, I WOULD BE GUESSING, SO DELEGATING MIGHT MAXIMIZE OUR CHANCE OF A CORRECT RESPONSE.

REASONING: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, MY TEAMMATE GOT A FEW QUESTIONS CORRECT IN AREAS WHERE I DID NOT, AND THIS SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT TARA CALICO'S DISAPPEARANCE MIGHT FALL INTO A NICHE AREA OF KNOWLEDGE. SINCE MY TRACK RECORD SHOWS A MIX OF CORRECT AND INCORRECT ANSWERS, AND CONSIDERING THE TEAMMATE'S OCCASIONAL ACCURACY ON OBSCURE TOPICS, I’LL DELEGATE THIS QUESTION TO INCREASE THE CHANCE OF A CORRECT RESPONSE.
