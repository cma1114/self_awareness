========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-1.5-pro_SimpleQA_50_500_team0.4_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 40.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 40.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 17.60%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 18.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 32.89%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 250/450 trials (55.56%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 42/200 (21.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 106/250 (42.40%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 148 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 32.89%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 9/50 (17.60%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 42/200 (21.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.4708, p-value = 0.6378
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 40.00%
- Always Self: 17.60%
- Always Teammate: 40.00%
- Random Choice: 28.80%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0020
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 17.60%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0020
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 28.80%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0608
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
