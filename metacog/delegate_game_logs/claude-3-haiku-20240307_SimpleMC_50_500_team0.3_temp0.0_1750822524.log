========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-haiku-20240307_SimpleMC_50_500_team0.3_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 30.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 30.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 29.60%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 30.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 28.44%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 227/450 trials (50.44%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 73/223 (32.74%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 55/227 (24.23%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 128 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 28.44%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 15/50 (29.60%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 73/223 (32.74%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.3740, p-value = 0.7084
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 30.00%
- Always Self: 29.60%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 29.80%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5038
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 29.60%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.6061
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5038
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 29.80%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5708
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
