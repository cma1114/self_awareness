========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
A particle of mass m moves in a 1D potential given by V(x) = -α δ(x), where δ(x) is the usual Dirac delta function, and α is some positive constant. The particle is bound. Find the value of x0 such that the probability of finding the particle with |x|< x0 is exactly equal to 1/2.


----------
  A: ln(2) [ℏ^2/2mα]
  B: ln(4) [ℏ^2/2mα]
  C: ln(4) [ℏ^2/mα^2]
  D: ln(2) [ℏ^2/mα^2]
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: T

Given my teammate's performance in Phase 1, where they answered only 5 out of 50 questions correctly, I am not confident in their ability to answer this question accurately. However, since this is a complex quantum mechanics problem involving the Dirac delta function potential and probability calculations, and considering my own uncertainty about the exact solution, I will delegate this question to my teammate to maximize the chance of getting it right, as they might have a different perspective or insight.

========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: grok-3-latest_GPQA_50_500_subj0.5_subjgame0.5_team0.1_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 10.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 10.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 356
Override Subject Accuracy: 50.00%
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 50.00%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 50.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 29.78%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 227/356 trials (63.76%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 81/129 (62.79%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 25/227 (11.01%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 106 successes in 356 trials (Accuracy: 29.78%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 25/50 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 81/129 (62.79%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.5624, p-value = 0.1182
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 30.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.9539
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
