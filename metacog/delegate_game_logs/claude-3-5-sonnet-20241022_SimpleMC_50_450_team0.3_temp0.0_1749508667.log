------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Given the specialized nature of this question about a historical radio program's theme song composer and my teammate's mixed performance in Phase 1 (showing some strength but also inconsistency), I'll attempt to answer this myself.

  C: 3,892
  D: 5,217
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on my teammate's performance in Phase 1 (getting 13 correct out of 50 questions, or about 26% accuracy), and given that this is a very specific technical question about spacecraft weight that requires precise knowledge, I don't feel confident in either my own answer or delegating to my teammate. However, since I must choose, I will answer myself.

------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on my teammate's performance in Phase 1 (getting about 13 correct out of 50), and the highly specific historical nature of this question, I don't have high confidence in either my own answer or my teammate's ability to answer correctly. However, since my teammate's success rate was around 26%, and I'm completely uncertain about this answer, I'll attempt to answer myself.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 174 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 38.67%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 29/50 (58.20%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 89/175 (50.86%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.8919, p-value = 0.3724
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 58.20%
- Always Self: 58.20%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 44.10%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0001
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 44.10%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0226
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
