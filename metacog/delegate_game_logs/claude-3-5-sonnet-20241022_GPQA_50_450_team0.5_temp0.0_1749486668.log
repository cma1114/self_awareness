For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?
----------
  A: ~0.57
  B: ~0.75
  C: ~0.83
  D: ~0.69
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on my performance in Phase 1 with similar astronomy questions and my teammate's generally good performance on such questions, I will delegate this to my teammate.

Question:
Congratulations, you just landed your dream job at one of the top structural biology labs at Stanford University in California. Without further ado, the Principal Investigator explains that the priority of the moment is to produce in E. coli BL21 then purify as quickly as possible the Human P53 protein.

The amino acid sequence of this protein is as follows:

Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Looking at my teammate's performance in Phase 1, they got 20 out of 50 questions correct, which is a 40% success rate. For this complex molecular biology question involving sequence analysis, I'll answer myself.

Looking at the sequences and comparing them to the given amino acid sequence, I'll choose D. The sequence in D appears to be the wild-type p53 sequence that would correctly translate to the given amino acid sequence, without any mutations or alterations that might affect protein expression or function.

Question:
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?
----------
  A: 10 thousand (10^4).
  B: 1 million (10^6).
  C: 100 million (10^8).
  D: 100 (10^2).

========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_GPQA_50_450_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 397
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 42.73%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 42.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 55.16%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 277/397 trials (69.77%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 85/120 (70.83%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 134/277 (48.38%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 219 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 55.16%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 21/50 (42.73%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 85/120 (70.83%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 3.5355, p-value = 0.0004
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 42.73%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 46.36%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0446
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 42.73%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0446
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 46.36%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0005
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
