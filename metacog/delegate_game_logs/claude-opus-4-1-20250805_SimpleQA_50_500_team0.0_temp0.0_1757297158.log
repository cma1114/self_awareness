Delegation to teammate occurred in 301/326 trials (92.33%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 16/25 (64.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 0/301 (0.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 16 successes in 326 trials (Accuracy: 4.91%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 21/50 (41.76%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 16/25 (64.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.7965, p-value = 0.0724
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 41.76%
- Always Self: 41.76%
- Always Teammate: 0.00%
- Random Choice: 20.88%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 41.76%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 41.76%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 0.00%):
    Result: Observed score (4.91%) is greater than the 0% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 0%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly GREATER)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 20.88%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
