--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 295 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 65.56%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 34/50 (67.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 246/362 (67.96%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.0063, p-value = 0.9950
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 67.00%
- Always Self: 67.00%
- Always Teammate: 60.00%
- Random Choice: 63.50%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 67.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5149
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 67.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.5149
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0161
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 63.50%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3784
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
