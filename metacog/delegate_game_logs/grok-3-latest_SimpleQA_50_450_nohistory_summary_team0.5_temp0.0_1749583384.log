    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering short answer questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

Explanation: Virgil K. Smith's driver's license was revoked in 2004 following the charges of operating a vehicle while impaired in February 2004 and operating a vehicle while intoxicated in August 2004. Since I am confident in this answer based on the timeline provided, I will answer it myself rather than delegating to my teammate.

========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: grok-3-latest_SimpleQA_50_450_nohistory_summary_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 399
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 34.08%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 34.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 383/399 trials (95.99%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 7/16 (43.75%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 192/383 (50.13%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 199 successes in 399 trials (Accuracy: 49.87%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 17/50 (34.08%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 7/16 (43.75%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.7057, p-value = 0.4804
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 34.08%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 42.04%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 1.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 34.08%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 1.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 42.04%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0016
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
