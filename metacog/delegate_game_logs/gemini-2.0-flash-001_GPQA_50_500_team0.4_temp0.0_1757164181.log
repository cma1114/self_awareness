--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 189 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 47.61%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 22/50 (44.52%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 89/155 (57.42%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.6559, p-value = 0.0977
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 44.52%
- Always Self: 44.52%
- Always Teammate: 40.00%
- Random Choice: 42.26%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 44.52%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2256
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 44.52%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2256
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 40.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0025
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 42.26%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0328
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
