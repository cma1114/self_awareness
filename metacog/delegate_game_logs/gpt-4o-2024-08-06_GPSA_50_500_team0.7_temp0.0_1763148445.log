In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The average energy \( \langle E \rangle \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle E \rangle = \sum_{n=1}^{4} \left| c_n \right|^2 E_n
\]

where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of the state \(|\psi\rangle\) and \( E_n = nE_o \).

\[
\langle E \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{15}\right)E_o + \left(\frac{2}{15}\right)2E_o + \left(\frac{4}{15}\right)3E_o + \left(\frac{16}{15}\right)4E_o
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{15}E_o + \frac{4}{15}E_o + \frac{12}{15}E_o + \frac{64}{15}E_o
\]

\[
= \frac{81}{15}E_o = \frac{27}{5}E_o
\]

The average energy of the system is \(\frac{27}{5}E_o\).

========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gpt-4o-2024-08-06_GPSA_50_500_team0.7_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 70.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 70.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 384
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 16.59%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 16.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 66.15%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 338/384 trials (88.02%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 13/46 (28.26%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 241/338 (71.30%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 254 successes in 384 trials (Accuracy: 66.15%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 8/50 (16.59%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 13/46 (28.26%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.4517, p-value = 0.1466
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 70.00%
- Always Self: 16.59%
- Always Teammate: 70.00%
- Random Choice: 43.29%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1062
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 16.59%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 70.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1062
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 43.29%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
