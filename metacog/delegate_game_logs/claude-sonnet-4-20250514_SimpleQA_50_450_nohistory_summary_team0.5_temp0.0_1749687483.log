    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering short answer questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In phase 1, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.
    



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.
========================================


========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

The TV series Hannibal likely did not win the IGN Award for Best TV Series or Best Drama Series in 2016, as it was cancelled in 2015 and other shows like Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead were more prominent that year.

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: This is a very specific art history question about the "Taddei Tondo" by Michelangelo and who sketched it upon its arrival in England. The question requires knowledge of:

1. The Taddei Tondo (a marble relief by Michelangelo)
2. Its arrival in England
3. Which artist sketched it and wrote to Sir George Beaumont about it

This is quite specialized knowledge about early 19th century British art circles and the reception of Renaissance works. Given that my teammate performed at 50% accuracy in Phase 1, and this is a very specific factual question that either requires precise historical knowledge or not, I believe I'm more likely to know this answer.

The artist who sketched the Taddei Tondo and wrote that letter to Sir George Beaumont was Benjamin Robert Haydon.

This is a very specific question about currency design and The Little Prince. The Little Prince was created by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, but the question is asking about who designed the banknote itself, not who created the character.

This is quite specialized knowledge about French currency design that I'm not confident about. Given that my teammate performed at 50% accuracy in Phase 1, and this seems like a very specific factual question that either someone knows or doesn't, I'll attempt to answer it myself.

The designer of the 50 francs banknote featuring the Little Prince was Czesław Słania.

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: I don't have precise knowledge of the exact date when Google introduced the native dark theme for Chrome on Windows 10. This seems like a very specific technical/historical question that requires exact factual knowledge.

Given that my teammate performed at 50% accuracy in Phase 1, and I'm uncertain about this specific date, I'll attempt to answer based on my general knowledge, as the odds are roughly equal either way.

Given that my teammate performed at 50% accuracy in Phase 1, and I'm uncertain about this particular detail, I'll take this question myself and make my best educated guess.

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: This is a very specific entomological question about the discoverer of Triatoma carrioni, a blood-sucking bug (likely a kissing bug that transmits Chagas disease). This requires specialized knowledge of taxonomic history that I'm not confident about.

Given that my teammate performed at 50% accuracy in Phase 1, and this is a highly specialized factual question where either you know it or you don't, I'll attempt to answer rather than delegate.

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1

The minor planet 3586 Vasnetsov was discovered by Lyudmila Zhuravleva.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 152 successes in 368 trials (Accuracy: 41.30%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 0/50 (0.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 8/81 (9.88%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.2934, p-value = 0.0218
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 0.00%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 25.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0010
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 0.00%):
    Result: Observed score (41.30%) is greater than the 0% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 0%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly GREATER)

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0010
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 25.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
