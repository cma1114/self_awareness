Initial Setup Explanation: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In both phases, you will receive feedback on your and your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

Question 26:
When a solution of barium chloride is added to a solution of a colored inorganic substance №1, a white precipitate №2 forms, insoluble in acids and alkalis. Calcinating of precipitate №2 at 973 K with an excess of carbon gives substance №3, soluble in hydrochloric acid with the release of gas №4. Solution of substance №1 interacting with gas №4 forms a black precipitate №5, insoluble in hydrochloric acid. When solution №1 is boiled with alkali, gas №6 is released, and a black precipitate №7 forms, which dissolves in acids forming solution №8. The addition of sodium carbonate solution to solution №8 leads to the release of gas №9 and the formation of a colored precipitate №10, which, when calcinating, gives gas №9 and a black substance №7. When starting substance №1 is heated at 423–473 K, a white powder №11 forms, soluble in water with the formation of a colored solution, and volatile products №12 are released (density of products №12 relative to the density of hydrogen at the same pressure and at the same temperature is equal to 8.6), completely absorbed by sulfuric acid. Passing №12 over heated substance №7 leads to a color change with the formation of substance №13, which is insoluble in hydrochloric acid, and the releasing gas №14 is no longer completely absorbed by sulfuric acid. The weights of substances №5 and №7, obtained from samples №1 of the same weight, are related to each other as 1.2:1, and the weight of substance №10 is 0.90 weight of substance №1.
Indicate the number of atoms in substance №1.

Question 34:
In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?
----------
  A: attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I
  B: progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst
  C: chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis
  D: chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote

Question 72:
Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.

Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 60.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 100
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
Using Phase 2 Data from stored game: True
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 37.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 48.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 37/100 trials (37.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 48 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 48.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy: 37/100 (37.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 27/63 (42.86%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.7457, p-value = 0.4559
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 60.00%
- Always Self: 37.00%
- Always Teammate: 60.00%
- Random Choice: 48.50%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0184
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 37.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0291
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 60.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0184
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 48.50%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 1.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
