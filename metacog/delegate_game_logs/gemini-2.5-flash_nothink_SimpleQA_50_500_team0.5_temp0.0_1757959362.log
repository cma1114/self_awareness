========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.5-flash_nothink_SimpleQA_50_500_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 420
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 23.83%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 24.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 46.90%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 293/420 trials (69.76%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 60/127 (47.24%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 137/293 (46.76%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 197 successes in 420 trials (Accuracy: 46.90%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 12/50 (23.83%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 60/127 (47.24%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.8342, p-value = 0.0046
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 23.83%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 36.91%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2225
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 23.83%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2225
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 36.91%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
