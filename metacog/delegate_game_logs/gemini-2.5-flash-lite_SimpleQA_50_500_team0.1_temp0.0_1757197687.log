Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 42/421 (9.98%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 45 successes in 435 trials (Accuracy: 10.34%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 5/50 (9.90%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 3/14 (21.43%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.1429, p-value = 0.2531
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 10.00%
- Always Self: 9.90%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 9.95%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.8103
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 9.90%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7479
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.8103
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 9.95%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7489
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
