Your final score in Phase 2: 198/450 (44.00%)
========================================


========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gpt-4o-mini_SimpleMC_50_500_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 32.40%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 32.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 44.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 316/450 trials (70.22%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 40/134 (29.85%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 158/316 (50.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 198 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 44.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 16/50 (32.40%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 40/134 (29.85%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.2819, p-value = 0.7781
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 32.40%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 41.20%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0124
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 32.40%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0124
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 41.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2314
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
