In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The hydrogen bond network in the tartrate ion favors self-association and precipitation. Acid protonates the tartrate, disrupting the network. Base deprotonates the hydrogen, increasing the charge and solubility.

Experimentally verify by measuring the solubility of potassium hydrogen tartrate at different pH values.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 12 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 12.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 52/333 (15.47%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 2/7 (28.57%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.9281, p-value = 0.3534
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 15.47%
- Always Self: 15.47%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
