In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 17 km/s

The critical distance for stellar encounters depends on the masses and velocities. Since Group 2 has lower mass stars (0.3 vs 0.5), they need lower velocities to achieve the same critical distance. Using the relationship that critical distance is proportional to (M1+M2)/v², we can solve for v2 = v1 * sqrt(0.6/1.0) = 22 * sqrt(0.6) ≈ 17 km/s.

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve this:
1) Initial potential would be E₀ = 0.77V (since [Fe³⁺]=[Fe²⁺])
2) Adding phosphate creates Fe(III)-H₂PO₄⁻ complex
3) Using Nernst equation and complex formation:
E = 0.77 - (0.059/1)log([Fe²⁺]/[Fe³⁺]free)
4) [Fe³⁺]free = [Fe³⁺]total/(1 + K[H₂PO₄⁻])
5) Substituting values:
E = 0.77 - 0.059log(0.01/(0.01/(1 + 10²¹×6.97×10⁻³)))
E ≈ 0.47V

In model_call, provider=Anthropic, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let me solve:
1) Using Kepler's laws and RV data:
M1_total = (v1+v2)³P1/2πG = (15)³×2/2πG
M2_total = (25)³×1/2πG

2) Ratio = M1/M2 = (15)³×2/(25)³×1 = 0.216

The ratio is 0.216, so system_1 is not more massive, it's about 4.63 times less massive than system_2.
