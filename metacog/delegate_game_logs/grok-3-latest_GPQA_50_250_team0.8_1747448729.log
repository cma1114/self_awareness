========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: grok-3-latest_GPQA_50_250_team0.8
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 80.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 80.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 250
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 45.41%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 46.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 78.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 215/250 trials (86.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 21/35 (60.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 174/215 (80.93%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 195 successes in 250 trials (Accuracy: 78.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 89/197 (45.41%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 21/35 (60.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.6183, p-value = 0.1056
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 45.41%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 62.71%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4293
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 45.41%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4293
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 62.71%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
