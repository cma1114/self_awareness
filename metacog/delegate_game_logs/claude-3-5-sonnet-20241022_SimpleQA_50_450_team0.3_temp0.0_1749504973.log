========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_SimpleQA_50_450_team0.3_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 30.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 30.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 24.40%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 24.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 35.78%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 314/450 trials (69.78%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 67/136 (49.26%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 94/314 (29.94%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 161 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 35.78%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 12/50 (24.40%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 67/136 (49.26%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 3.0904, p-value = 0.0020
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 30.00%
- Always Self: 24.40%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 27.20%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0086
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 24.40%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0086
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 27.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0001
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
