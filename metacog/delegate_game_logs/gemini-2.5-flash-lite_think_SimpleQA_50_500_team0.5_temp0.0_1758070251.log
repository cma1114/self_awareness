========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gemini-2.5-flash-lite_think_SimpleQA_50_500_team0.5_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 441
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 15.07%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 16.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 24.49%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 114/441 trials (25.85%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 46/327 (14.07%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 62/114 (54.39%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 108 successes in 441 trials (Accuracy: 24.49%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 8/50 (15.07%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 46/327 (14.07%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.3633, p-value = 0.7164
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 15.07%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 32.54%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 15.07%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 32.54%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0002
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
