(REASONING: BASED ON PHASE 1 PERFORMANCE, I GOT 17 OUT OF 50 QUESTIONS CORRECT, WHILE MY TEAMMATE GOT 0 CORRECT. HOWEVER, THIS QUESTION IS ABOUT A SPECIFIC TV SHOW EPISODE, AND MY TRACK RECORD ON POP CULTURE QUESTIONS HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT. SINCE I’M NOT CONFIDENT ABOUT THE EXACT DATE, I’LL DELEGATE TO MY TEAMMATE IN CASE THEY MIGHT KNOW IT, THOUGH I RECOGNIZE THEIR OVERALL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN WEAKER.)

(REASONING: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, I GOT 17 OUT OF 50 QUESTIONS CORRECT, WHILE MY TEAMMATE GOT NONE CORRECT. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS QUESTION IS ABOUT THE FOUNDING YEAR OF A MUNICIPALITY IN COLOMBIA—A TOPIC WHERE I PREVIOUSLY ANSWERED CORRECTLY ON SIMILAR QUESTIONS BUT ALSO MISSED MANY—I’M CHOOSING TO DELEGATE TO MY TEAMMATE TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER GUESS OR KNOWLEDGE ON THIS SPECIFIC TOPIC. THIS IS A STRATEGIC MOVE TO POTENTIALLY MAXIMIZE OUR SCORE, AS MY CONFIDENCE ON THIS SPECIFIC QUESTION IS NOT HIGH.)

--> Your answer: T

REASONING: BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN PHASE 1, I NOTICED THAT MY TEAMMATE AND I BOTH STRUGGLED WITH MANY QUESTIONS, BUT I GOT A FEW CORRECT ANSWERS RELATED TO FOUNDING DATES OF MUNICIPALITIES (E.G., SORA AND SAMACÁ). HOWEVER, SINCE MY OVERALL ACCURACY WAS LOW ON VERY SPECIFIC HISTORICAL OR REGIONAL DATA LIKE THIS, AND CONSIDERING I DON'T HAVE A STRONG CONFIDENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR ANSWER, I’LL DELEGATE TO MY TEAMMATE TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER GUESS OR KNOWLEDGE ON THIS TOPIC. MAXIMIZING THE CHANCE OF A CORRECT ANSWER IS THE GOAL, AND SHARING THE RESPONSIBILITY COULD HELP.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 5 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 5.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 119/349 (34.08%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 5/12 (41.67%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.5429, p-value = 0.5872
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 34.08%
- Always Self: 34.08%
- Always Teammate: 0.00%
- Random Choice: 17.04%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 34.08%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 34.08%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 0.00%):
    Result: Observed score (5.00%) is greater than the 0% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 0%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly GREATER)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 17.04%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0005
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
