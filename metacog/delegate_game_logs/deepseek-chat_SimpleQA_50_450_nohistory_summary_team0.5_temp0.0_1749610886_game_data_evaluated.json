        "Given that your teammate has a 50% accuracy rate in Phase 1, and this question is quite specialized (requiring knowledge of a specific paleontological discovery), it's likely that neither you nor your teammate would know the answer with high confidence. However, since the question is niche, the chance of your teammate knowing it is low, and guessing might not be better than their 50% accuracy. \n\nIf you have no idea, delegating (T) might be marginally better, as your teammate could potentially know it. But if you think you can make an educated guess, you might try answering yourself. \n\nSince the question is highly specific and the answer is likely \"Mimotricentes\" (a multituberculate from the Denver Basin), but this is a very uncertain guess, I'd lean toward delegating to avoid a likely incorrect answer. \n\nYour choice: T": 1.0
