========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
Consider a stack of N optical layers (made of a material of refractive index n), separated by air gaps. The thickness of each layer is t_1 and that of each gap is t_2. A plane wave (of wavelength \lambda) is incident normally on this stack. If the optical thickness of each layer and each gap is given by a quarter of \lambda, the transmissivity of the entire stack is given by [when n^(2N) >> 1]
----------
  A: n^{-4N}
  B: 4n^{-2N}
  C: 4n^{-N}
  D: 2n^{-N}
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on my teammate's strong performance in physics questions during phase 1 (getting most of them correct), I will delegate this question.

========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========
For each question, enter your answer (A, B, C, D) or 'T' to let your teammate answer.

------------------------------
Question:
A reaction of a liquid organic compound, which molecules consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms, is performed at 80 centigrade and 20 bar for 24 hours. In the proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, the signals with the highest chemical shift of the reactant are replaced by a signal of the product that is observed about three to four units downfield. Compounds from which position in the periodic system of the elements, which are also used in the corresponding large-scale industrial process, have been mostly likely initially added in small amounts?
----------
  A: A metal compound from the fourth period.
  B: A metal compound from the fifth period.
  C: A metal compound from the fourth period and a non-metal compound from the second period.
  D: A metal compound from the fifth period and a non-metal compound from the third period.
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on my performance in Phase 1 and my teammate's performance, I will delegate this question to my teammate.

Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 332
Override Subject Accuracy: 50.00%
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 50.00%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 50.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 55.72%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 261/332 trials (78.61%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 55/71 (77.46%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 130/261 (49.81%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 185 successes in 332 trials (Accuracy: 55.72%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 25/50 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 55/71 (77.46%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 3.1430, p-value = 0.0017
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 50.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0421
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0421
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0421
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0421
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
