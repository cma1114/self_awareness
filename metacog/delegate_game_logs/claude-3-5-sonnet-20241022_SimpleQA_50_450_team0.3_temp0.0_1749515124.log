Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 101/362 (27.90%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 143 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 31.78%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 12/50 (24.40%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 42/88 (47.73%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.7452, p-value = 0.0060
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 30.00%
- Always Self: 24.40%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 27.20%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4108
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 24.40%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0004
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4108
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 27.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0339
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
