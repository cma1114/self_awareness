--> Your answer: The orbital period ratio P3/P1 = 8

Since equilibrium temperature T ∝ 1/√a (where a is orbital distance), and P² ∝ a³ (Kepler's Third Law), we can use the temperature ratios to find the period ratio:
T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3
This means P3/P1 = 8

Star1: v = cΔλ/λ = (3x10⁵)(0.1/6300) = 4.8 km/s
Star2: v = 2πR/P = 2π(1.5R☉)/(20 days) = 3.8 km/s
Star3: v = 3.1/sin(30°) = 6.2 km/s
Star4: v = 2πR/P = 2π(1.4R☉)/(9 days) = 7.8 km/s

Star4 rotates fastest at 7.8 km/s.
