Question:
Consider an electron fixed at the origin, and a magnetic field (with constant magnitude B_0 and aligned at an angle \theta with the z-axis) processes with a frequency \omega about the z-axis. Assume that \omega is much less than eB0/m (e is electronic charge and m is electron's mass). If the electron is initially in the spin-up state, then, in time-asymptotic limit,
----------
  A: the probability that the electron is in spin up state will be nearly zero
  B: the probability that the electron is in spin up state will be nearly 0.5
  C: the probability that the electron is in spin down state will vary with time at a frequency (eB_0/m)-\omega\cos\theta
  D: the probability that the electron is in spin down state will be nearly zero

Question:
A particle of mass m is moving in a 1D potential V(x) = k|x|^n, where k and n are positive constants. The particle is initially at x=0 with zero velocity. The particle is then released and allowed to move. Which of the following statements is true?
----------
  A: For n=2, the particle will oscillate about x=0 with a period that depends on the value of k.
  B: For n=1, the particle will move with constant acceleration.
  C: For n>2, the particle will escape to infinity in finite time.
  D: For n<2, the particle will never reach x=0.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 228 successes in 397 trials (Accuracy: 57.43%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 15/50 (30.43%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 86/220 (39.09%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.1992, p-value = 0.2305
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 30.43%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 55.21%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 30.43%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 55.21%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3911
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
