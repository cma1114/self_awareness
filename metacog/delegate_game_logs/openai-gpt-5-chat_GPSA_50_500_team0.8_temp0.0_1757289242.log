\Delta p_x \ge \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta x} = \frac{1.055\times10^{-34}}{2 \times 1.0\times10^{-10}} \approx 5.3\times10^{-25}\,\text{kg·m/s}
\]

Momentum of electron: \(p = mv = 9.11\times10^{-31}\times 2\times10^8 \approx 1.82\times10^{-22}\,\text{kg·m/s}.\)

Energy sensitivity: \(\Delta E \approx v \Delta p \approx (2\times10^8)(5.3\times10^{-25}) \approx 1.06\times10^{-16}\,\text{J} \approx 0.66\,\text{eV}.\)

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: We need \(R_{\rm pl}/R_\star\).  

**Step 1. Flux reduction due to spots**  
- Star’s surface split in half; one hemisphere has 20% dark spots.  
- Spot temperature = 6000 – 1000 = 5000 K.  
- Specific flux ∝ \(T^4\).  
  - Bright photosphere: \(F_{\rm phot} = (6000)^4\).  
  - Spot flux = (5000)^4.  
- Ratio: \((5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482.  

So a spotted area radiates only ~48.2% as bright, i.e. ~51.8% dimmer.

**Step 2. Weighted average intensity per unit area on spotted hemisphere**  
Fraction normal (no spots): 80%  
Fraction spots: 20%  
→ effective radiance = 0.8 × 1.000 + 0.2 × 0.482 = 0.8 + 0.0964 = 0.8964 (normalized to \(6000^4\)).  

**Step 3. Brightness variation**  
- Hemisphere without spots brightness = 1.0.  
- Hemisphere with spots brightness = 0.8964.  
Difference = 0.1036 (fractional amplitude ~10.4%).

**Step 4. Transit depth equivalence**  
Transit depth = (Rpl/Rstar)².  
So (Rpl/Rstar)² ≈ 0.104.  
→ Rpl/Rstar ≈ √0.104 ≈ 0.322.

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: For the Sun, \(A(\text{Fe}) = 7.4\) dex means  
\[
\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{N_{\text{Fe}}}{N_{\text{H}}}\right) + 12 = 7.4 \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \frac{N_{\text{Fe}}}{N_{\text{H}}} = 10^{-4.6}.
\]

Target star: \([{\rm Fe/H}] = -0.3\) dex, so relative (Fe/H) is reduced by factor \(10^{-0.3} \approx 0.5\).  
Thus  
\[
\left(\frac{N_{\text{Fe}}}{N_{\text{H}}}\right)_\star \approx 0.5 \times \left(\frac{N_{\text{Fe}}}{N_{\text{H}}}\right)_\odot.
\]

So the target star has approximately the **same number of H atoms as the Sun** (per Fe), within a factor of ~2.  
Since its [Fe/H] is –0.3, **the hydrogen abundance is slightly enhanced relative to iron**, meaning **hydrogen abundance is essentially solar‑like.**  

**Answer:** The star’s hydrogen abundance is approximately solar (hydrogen atoms roughly the same as in the Sun’s photosphere).

--> Your answer: There is an essential truncated isoform of kinase X lacking the N‑terminus but retaining the C‑terminus and catalytic domain; the C‑terminal sgRNAs specifically deplete this isoform, causing lethality. The tool compound lethality is due to off‑target inhibition of other essential kinases, not X itself.

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The RV semi-amplitude (Δλ/λ ∝ v_rad) scales as \(K \propto P^{-1/3}\) (for same stellar/planet masses and circular orbits).  

So,  
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{-1/3}.
\]

Given shifts: \(K_1:K_2 = 5:7.\)  

Thus,  
\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{-1/3} \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3.
\]

\(\left(\tfrac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{343}{125} \approx 2.74.\)

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let's solve it:  

**Step 1:** Benzene + Cl₂/FeCl₃ → A = **Chlorobenzene**.  

**Step 2:** Benzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (60 °C) → B = **Nitrobenzene**.  

**Step 3:** A + 2HNO₃/H₂SO₄/120 °C → C = **2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene** (electrophilic substitution positions).  

**Step 4:** B + Fe/HCl → D = **Aniline** (reduction of nitrobenzene).  

**Step 5:** C + D in EtOH, –HCl → E.  
This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (Cl displaced by –NH₂ from aniline).  
So E = **2,4-dinitrodiphenylamine**.  

**Step 6:** E + x HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → F.  
Further nitration leads to **2,4,6-trinitrodiphenylamine (picramide derivative)**, also known as **picramide-related explosives**.  
Actually: Diphenylamine nitrates to **trinitramine derivatives**; result is **2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-2,4,6-trinitroaniline**. Simplify: it forms **symmetrical trinitrophenyl-substituted diphenylamine** (very substituted, only two kinds of H: one NH proton, one aromatic that's left).  

Given data: In ¹H NMR, only 2 signals; one disappears under D₂O → that's the NH.  
So the **second signal must be equivalent aromatic hydrogens** (all others are substituted with nitro, except two equivalent H left).  

Thus F = highly nitrated diphenylamine derivative with only **2 N–H’s? Wait**: No, just **1 –NH–** (exchangeable), and exactly two equivalent aromatic protons.  

So total hydrogens in F = 1 (NH) + 2 (aromatic) = **3 H atoms**.

--> Your answer: **Answer:** Enthalpy of neutralization is based on moles of water formed.  

- HCl: \(0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.10\) mol H⁺  
- H₂SO₄: \(0.3 \times 0.3 \times 2 = 0.18\) mol H⁺  
  (0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H₂SO₄, ×2 = 0.18 mol H⁺)  
- Total H⁺ = 0.10 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol  
- Ba(OH)₂: \(0.2 \times 0.5 \times 2 = 0.20\) mol OH⁻  

Limiting = OH⁻ (0.20 mol).  
So 0.20 mol water formed.  

Standard enthalpy of neutralization ≈ –57 kJ per mol.  

\(\Delta H \approx -0.20 \times 57 \,\text{kJ} \;= -11.4 \,\text{kJ}\).  

**Final: –11.4 kJ**

--> Your answer: System mass ∝ \( (K_1+K_2)^3 P \) from binary mass function.  

- System_1: \(K_1+K_2 = 15\), \(P=2\)  
→ ∝ \(15^3 \cdot 2 = 3375 \cdot 2 = 6750\).  

- System_2: \(K_1+K_2 = 25\), \(P=1\)  
→ ∝ \(25^3 \cdot 1 = 15625\).  

Ratio \(= 6750 / 15625 \approx 0.43\).  

So, actually **system_1 is less massive**, by about a factor of 0.43.  
Equivalently, **system_2 is ~2.3× more massive than system_1.**

\frac{N_3}{N_1} \;=\; \frac{g_3}{g_1}\, e^{-\frac{E_3 - E_1}{kT}}
\]

For H atom:  
- \(g_n = 2n^2\). So \(g_1=2\), \(g_3=18\). Ratio \(=9\).  
- \(E_1=-13.6\) eV, \(E_3=-13.6/9 \approx -1.51\) eV.  
So \(\Delta E = E_3 - E_1 = 12.09\) eV.  
- At \(T=10^4\) K: \(kT = 8.617\times 10^{-5}\,{\rm eV/K}\times 10^4 \approx 0.862\,{\rm eV}\).  

So exponential factor: \(\exp(-12.09/0.862) \approx \exp(-14.0)\approx 8.2\times 10^{-7}\).

--> Your answer: The wavefunction:  
\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5 i, \quad 1 \le x \le 3.
\]

Normalization condition:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

So,  
\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 \quad (\text{since real and imaginary parts})
= \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Then  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

Compute:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{dx}{1+x}
= a^2 [\ln(1+x)]_{1}^{3} = a^2 (\ln 4 - \ln 2) = a^2 \ln 2.
\]

Second term:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25\times (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

So normalization:  
\[
a^2 \ln 2 + 0.5 = 1,
\]

\[
a^2 \ln 2 = 0.5 \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln 2}.
\]

\[
a = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{\ln 2}}.
\]

Numerical: \(\ln 2 \approx 0.6931\).

--> Your answer: We start from decay survival probability:  
\[
P = e^{-\frac{R}{\gamma c \tau}}
\]  
where mean decay length = \(\gamma c \tau\).  

We are told: for \(\gamma \approx 20,\) the survival probability \(P \approx 1/3.\)  
So:  
\[
\frac{1}{3} = e^{-\frac{R}{20 c \tau}}.
\]  

Take logs:  
\(-\ln (1/3) = \frac{R}{20 c \tau}.\)  
So:  
\[
\frac{R}{c \tau} = 20 \ln 3.
\]  

We want \(\gamma\) such that \(P = 2/3.\)  

So:  
\[
\frac{2}{3} = e^{-\frac{R}{\gamma c \tau}}.
\]  

Taking logs:  
\(-\ln(2/3) = \frac{R}{\gamma c \tau}.
\]  

But \(R/(c \tau) = 20 \ln 3.\)  

So:  
\(\frac{R}{\gamma c \tau} = \ln(3/2).\)  

Thus:  
\(\gamma = \frac{R}{c \tau \ln(3/2)} = \frac{20 \ln 3}{\ln (3/2)}.\)  

Numerics:  
\(\ln 3 \approx 1.0986\).  
\(\ln(3/2) \approx 0.4055.\)  

So:  
\(\gamma \approx 20 \times (1.0986/0.4055) \approx 20 \times 2.71 \approx 54.2.\)

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: We need max brightness (no eclipse/transit) over min brightness (deepest eclipse / transit).

**Step 1: Luminosities of the stars** (use \(L \propto R^2 T^4\), compared to Sun = \(R_\odot,\;6000K\)):  
- Star A: \(1^2 \times (6000/6000)^4 = 1\ L_\odot\).  
- Star B: \(0.5^2 \times (4000/6000)^4 = 0.25 \times (2/3)^4 \approx 0.25 \times 0.1975 = 0.0494\ L_\odot\).  
Total max brightness = \(1 + 0.0494 = 1.0494\ L_\odot\).  

**Step 2: Min brightness (largest occultation):**  
- Planet radius = 0.1 Rsun.  
Brightness blocked = fraction of stellar disk covered × star’s flux contribution.  

(a) Transit across A (radius 1 Rsun):  
Blocked fraction = (0.1² / 1²) = 0.01.  
So lost flux ≈ 0.01 × L(A) = 0.01\ L_\odot.  
System in this case ≈ 1.0494 – 0.01 = 1.0394\ L_\odot.  

(b) Transit across B (radius 0.5 Rsun):  
Blocked fraction = (0.1² / 0.5²) = 0.01 / 0.25 = 0.04.  
Lost flux = 0.04 × L(B) = 0.04 × 0.0494 ≈ 0.0020\ L_\odot.  
System ≈ 1.0474\ L_\odot. (less deep).  

(c) Stellar eclipse: If B eclipses A fully (unlikely since smaller, but max possible), then min brightness = L(B)=0.0494 Lsun.  
If A eclipses B fully: min brightness = L(A)=1.0.  
→ deepest dip is A being eclipsed.  

So compare:  
- Planet transits reduce brightness only by ~1%.  
- Stellar eclipse A fully hidden reduces to 0.0494 Lsun (~20× difference).  

**Step 3: Ratio max/min:**  
Max = 1.0494, min = 0.0494.  
Ratio = 1.0494 / 0.0494 ≈ 21.2.

Thus the product is a fully saturated cyclohexane derivative (alkyl substituted hydrocarbon).  

A saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with no rings has IHD = 0, but here we still have **one ring (the cyclohexane backbone)**.  

So the **index of hydrogen deficiency = 1**.

Travel speed \(v = 0.99999987\,c\).  

Time in Earth frame: \(t \approx \frac{1.6 \times 10^{5}}{0.99999987}\,\text{yr} \approx 1.6 \times 10^{5}\,\text{yr}.\)  

Now, compute Lorentz factor \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}.\)  
Here, \(1-v \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-7}\), so  
\(\gamma \approx 1/\sqrt{2\times1.3\times10^{-7}} \approx 2 \times 10^{3}.\)  

Proper time for astronaut = \(t/\gamma \approx (1.6\times 10^{5}) / (2000) \approx 80\) years.

--> Your answer: Normalize the spinor: \((3i,4)\).  

Norm² = \(|3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25\). So normalized state:  
\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{5}(3i,\,4).
\]

Expectation of \(S_y = \tfrac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi|\sigma_y|\psi\rangle\).

\(\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}0 & -i \\ i & 0\end{pmatrix}\).

Compute:  
\(\sigma_y \begin{pmatrix}3i \\ 4\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -i\cdot 4 \\ i\cdot 3i \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}-4i \\ -3\end{pmatrix}\).

Dot with conjugate of \((3i,4)/5\): conj = \((-3i,4)/5\).

So \(\langle \psi|\sigma_y|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{25}[(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\).

\((-3i)(-4i) = 12 (i^2) = -12\).  
Then + (4 * -3) = -12. Sum = -24.

Divide by 25 = -24/25.

So \(\langle S_y\rangle = \tfrac{\hbar}{2} (-24/25) = -\tfrac{12}{25}\hbar\).

--> Your answer: We want the decay length for flux reduction to 25% (i.e. 3/4 decayed).  

---

**Step 1. Lorentz factor**  
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{4}{1.48} \approx 2.70.
\]  

Mean lifetime in lab:  
\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 2.70 \times 8.7\times10^{-5}\,\text{s} \approx 2.35\times10^{-4}\,\text{s}.
\]  

Velocity: β ≈ \(\sqrt{1-1/\gamma^2} \approx 0.93\).  

So mean decay length:
\[
L = \beta c \tau \approx 0.93\times (3.0\times10^8)(2.35\times10^{-4})
\]  
\[
\approx 6.6\times 10^4 \, \text{m}.
\]

---

**Step 2. Flux reduction to 25%**  
Fraction surviving at distance \(d\):  
\[
f = e^{-d/L}.
\]  

We want \( f=0.25 \).  
\[
d = - L \ln(0.25) = L \ln(4) \approx 1.386 L.
\]  

So \( d \approx 1.386 \times 6.6\times10^4 \,\text{m} \).  
\[
d \approx 9.2 \times 10^4 \,\text{m}.

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: We want the ratio of occupations for two levels with energy separation corresponding to λ = 1448 Å.  

**Step 1. Energy difference**  
\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
\]  
Take \(hc = 1240 \ \text{eV·nm}.\)  
λ = 144.8 nm = 1448 Å.  
So \(\Delta E \approx 1240 / 144.8 \approx 8.56\ \text{eV}.\)

**Step 2. Boltzmann factor ratio**  
Population ratio = \(\frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto e^{-\Delta E/(kT)}.\)

We are asked: factor by which ratio (n₂/n₁) changes between T=6000K vs 5500K.

So compute:  
\[
f = \frac{e^{-\Delta E/(k \cdot 6000)}}{e^{-\Delta E/(k \cdot 5500)}}
= e^{-\Delta E/k \cdot (1/6000 - 1/5500)}.
\]

**Step 3. Numbers**  
k = 8.617×10⁻⁵ eV/K.  
kT₁ (6000) = 0.517 eV.  
kT₂ (5500) = 0.474 eV.  

Exponent: ΔE*(1/6000 - 1/5500)/k? Wait carefully:  
\(f = \exp[-\Delta E(1/kT_1 - 1/kT_2)].\)  

Compute 1/(kT1) = 1/0.517 = 1.935 eV⁻¹.  
1/(kT2) = 1/0.474 = 2.111 eV⁻¹.  
Difference = 1.935 - 2.111 = -0.176.  

Multiply by -ΔE = -8.56*( -0.176) = +1.51.  
So f = exp(1.51) ≈ 4.5.  

**Answer:** The ratio (n₂/n₁) at 6000K is about **4.5 times larger** than at 5500K.

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The given state is the **symmetric combination with total spin \(S = \tfrac{1}{2}\)** (a W–type state).  

We can use the identity:  
\[
\sum_{i<j}\vec{S}_i\cdot \vec{S}_j = \tfrac{1}{2}\Big[\; S^2 - \sum_i S_i^2 \;\Big].
\]

For 3 spin‑½ particles:  
\(\sum_i S_i^2 = 3 \cdot \tfrac{3}{4} = \tfrac{9}{4}.\)  

- If total spin \(S = \tfrac{3}{2}\): \(S^2 = \tfrac{15}{4}\). Then \(\sum S_i\cdot S_j = \tfrac{1}{2}(15/4 - 9/4) = 3/4.\)  
- If total spin \(S = \tfrac{1}{2}\): \(S^2 = \tfrac{3}{4}\). Then \(\sum S_i\cdot S_j = \tfrac{1}{2}(3/4 - 9/4) = -3/4.\)

The given symmetric superposition with 2 ups and 1 down is indeed part of the **\(S=\tfrac{1}{2}\) multiplet, not the \(S=\tfrac{3}{2}\) fully symmetric one**. So its eigenvalue is \(-3/4\).  

Therefore, yes it is an eigenstate, with  
\[
E = A\cdot \Big(-\tfrac{3}{4}\Big).
\]  

**Answer:**  
Yes, it’s an eigenfunction. The energy eigenvalue is \(-\tfrac{3}{4}A\).

So star Y is \((2^4)=16\) times more luminous than star X.  

Planetary distance effect: flux ∝ 1/r². Planet Y is 2× closer, so receives 4× more flux.  

So per unit surface area, Y receives \(16×4 = 64\) times more energy flux.  

But planet surface area is proportional to circumference², i.e. (2× circumference → 4× surface area).  

So total energy absorbed = flux × planet area → \(64 \times 4 = 256\).

\(\hbar c = 197 \,\text{MeV·fm}, \quad \hbar = 6.58 \times 10^{-25}\,\text{GeV·s}\).  

\(\Gamma = 320 \,\text{MeV} = 0.32\,\text{GeV}\).

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Each of the 12 charges sits at distance 2 m from P (where another charge is).  

- Charge at P = \(q = 2e\).  
- Each surrounding charge also = \(2e\).  
- Energy of interaction of *central* charge with all 12 others:  
\[
U_{center} = \sum_{i=1}^{12} \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} 
= 12 \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{4e^2}{2} 
= 12 \cdot \frac{2e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}.
\]  
\[
U_{center} = \frac{24e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}.
\]

- Now interactions among the 12 on the sphere:  
Minimum energy if they are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 m (Thomson problem). That energy is not simply all at same distance, but complicated. But maybe the problem considers just central particle interactions — so "minimum energy" is just central–outer interactions.  
Thus:  
\[
U = \frac{24 e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}.
\]

Now compute:  
\(e = 1.602\times 10^{-19} C\).  
\(e^2 = 2.566\times 10^{-38} C^2\).  
\(1/4\pi\epsilon_0 = 8.99\times 10^9\).  

So  
\(\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = 2.307\times 10^{-28} J \cdot m.\)  

Multiply by 24: \(5.537\times 10^{-27} J \cdot m\).  

But we must divide by distance? Careful: We did include r=2 earlier. Let's recalc:  

Each interaction energy:  
\(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\).  

Here \(q_1=2e, q_2=2e → q_1q_2=4e^2\).  
r=2 m.  

So one interaction = \(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{4e^2}{2} = \frac{2e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\).  

Multiply by 12 → \(24 e^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0)\). (Correct). Already used factor of r. Good.  

Now compute:  
\(24 \times 2.566\times 10^{-38} = 6.159\times 10^{-37}\).  
× \(8.99\times 10^9 = 5.53\times 10^{-27} J.\)

Each \(S_i = \pm 1\).

\[
E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3).
\]

Case 1: All spins same (all +1 or all −1).  
Then each product = +1, so sum = 3 → \(E = -3J\).  
Number of such states = 2.

Case 2: Two spins up, one down (or reverse).  
Then two products are −1, one product is +1, sum = −1 → \(E = +J\).  
Number of such states = 6.

M \propto \frac{L}{L_\text{Edd}} \propto L \quad\text{(since Eddington-limited)}
\]  
Observed flux \(F = L/(4\pi d_L^2)\).  
So \(M \propto F d_L^2\).  

Approximate luminosity distance for low z: \(d_L \approx \frac{cz}{H_0}\).  

Thus the ratio:  
\[
\frac{M_A}{M_B} = \frac{F_A (z_A^2)}{F_B (z_B^2)}.
\]

Plugging in:  
- \(F_A = 10^{-25},\; z_A = 0.06\).  
- \(F_B = 10^{-24},\; z_B = 0.02\).  

\[
M_A/M_B = \frac{10^{-25} \cdot (0.06)^2}{10^{-24} \cdot (0.02)^2}

\[
\frac{D_A}{D_B} = \left(\frac{\mathcal{M}_{c,A}}{\mathcal{M}_{c,B}}\right)^{5/3}.
\]

Chirp mass:  
\[
\mathcal{M}_c = \frac{(m_1 m_2)^{3/5}}{(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}}.
\]

- For A: \(m_1=10,\; m_2=25 \;\Rightarrow\; (10\cdot25)^{3/5}/(35)^{1/5}.\)  
\((250)^{0.6}/(35)^{0.2}.\) Approx: \(250^{0.6} ≈ 10^{0.6\cdot \log10 250}.\) \(\log_{10}250≈2.398,\; 0.6×2.398≈1.439,\;10^{1.439}≈27.5.\) Denominator \(35^{0.2}\); \(\log10 35≈1.544,\;0.2×1.544=0.309,\;10^{0.309}=2.04.\) So ≈27.5/2.04 = 13.5.  

- For B: \(m_1=35,\; m_2=50,\; product=1750.\; 1750^{0.6}/(85^{0.2}).\)  
\(\log10 1750≈3.243,\;×0.6=1.946,\;10^{1.946}=88.2.\) Denominator: 85^{0.2}, log10 85≈1.93,×0.2=0.386,\;10^{0.386}=2.44.\; So value ≈ 88.2/2.44=36.2.  

So ratio \(M_cA/M_cB = 13.5/36.2 ≈ 0.373.\)

Now distance ratio: \((0.373)^{5/3}\). ln(0.373)≈ -0.987. ×1.667= -1.645. exp(-1.645)=0.193.

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: PH₃ decomposition:  
\[
4PH_3 \;\;\rightarrow\;\; P_4 + 6H_2
\]  

Stoichiometry: 4 vol PH₃ → 1 vol P₄ + 6 vol H₂ → total = 7 vols from 4 vols reactant.  
So decomposition of 500 mL PH₃ would yield 125 mL P₄ + 375 mL H₂ (total 500 mL consumed, products 500 mL total).  
But question says total rises to 600 mL, meaning only partial decomposition.  

Let α = fraction decomposed.  
Starting vol = 500.  
After α decomposition:  
Unreacted PH₃ = 500(1–α).  
Products: (125/500)×500α = 125α (P₄), (375/500)×500α = 375α (H₂).  
Total = 500 – 500α + 125α + 375α = 500 + 0 = 500. Hmm… always 500, but they state 600. Possibly a misprint? Perhaps decomposition equation incorrectly quoted.  

Alternative: Reaction: 2PH₃ → 2P + 3H₂. Then 2 vols PH₃ → 3 vols H₂. So net +1 vol per 2 PH₃.  
Starting 500. If complete, H₂ = 750, P (solid) = 0 vol, so gas volume = 750. Increase by 250. Given increase by 100. So incomplete.  

Total final gas vol = 600. Increase = 100. With reaction stoich, 2 → 3, each 2 PH₃ gives +1 vol. So ΔV = (1/2)nPH₃ reacted.  
Volume reacted PH₃ = 200. So formed H₂ = (3/2)×200 = 300.  

Thus H₂ produced = 300 mL.  

Now fuel cell uses O₂: Reaction 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O. Stoich 2:1.  
O₂ used = 50 mL → consumes 100 mL H₂.  

So unreacted H₂ = 300 – 100 = 200 mL.

\[
\frac{1}{2}\otimes\frac{1}{2}\otimes\frac{1}{2} = \tfrac{3}{2} \;\oplus\; \tfrac{1}{2}\;\oplus\;\tfrac{1}{2}.
\]

- A **quartet (spin-3/2 multiplet, 4 states)**  
- Two **doublets (spin-1/2 multiplets, 2+2 states = 4 total)**  

So the molecular states consist of one \(S=\tfrac{3}{2}\) quadruplet and two degenerate \(S=\tfrac{1}{2}\) doublets.

Let \(\lambda\) be decay constant.  

Given: \(P(\text{decay within 100}) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}\).  
So, \(e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68\).  
\(\lambda = -\frac{1}{100}\ln(0.68) \approx 0.00385\ \text{min}^{-1}\).  

We want \(P(\text{decay in next 150} \mid \text{survived 50}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}\).  

= \(1 - e^{-0.00385 \times 150} = 1 - e^{-0.577} \approx 1 - 0.562 = 0.438\).

Velocity \(v = 6.0\times10^4 \text{ km/s} = 6.0\times10^7 \text{ m/s} \;=\; 0.2c.\)  

Lorentz factor:  
\(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} \approx 1.0206.\)  

Proper time (ejecta frame): \(\Delta \tau = 50 \text{ s}\).  
Galaxy frame time: \( \Delta t = \gamma \Delta \tau \approx 1.0206 \times 50 = 51.0 \text{ s}.\)  

Distance traveled in Galaxy frame:  
\(d = v \Delta t = 6.0\times10^7 \,\text{m/s} \times 51.0 \text{ s} \approx 3.06 \times 10^9 \,\text{m}.\)

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: We need mean decay length in lab frame and then what fraction decays within detector resolution.

**Step 1. Lorentz γ**  
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.92.
\]

**Step 2. Dilated lifetime**  
\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.92 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}\,\text{s} \approx 6.34 \times 10^{-15}\,\text{s}.
\]

**Step 3. Mean decay length**  
\[
L = c\tau \approx (3.0 \times 10^8)(6.34 \times 10^{-15}) \approx 1.9 \times 10^{-6}\,\text{m} \;\;=\;1.9\,\mu\text{m}.
\]

**Step 4. Distance for 30% probability**  
Probability to decay within distance \(d\):  
\[
P = 1 - e^{-d/L}.
\]  
Require \(P \ge 0.3\).  
So \(d/L = -\ln(0.7) \approx 0.357\).  
Hence \(d = 0.357 L \approx 0.357 \times 1.9\,\mu\text{m} \approx 0.68\,\mu\text{m}.
\]

Choice registered. Moving to the next question...

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Let's solve this one.  

---

**Step 1. Conservation of energy & momentum**  
- Rest mass of electron: \(m_ec^2 = 0.511\ \text{MeV}\).  
- Incoming positron has rest energy \(0.511\ \text{MeV}\) + kinetic, moving with speed \(v\).  
- Total initial energy:  
  \[
  E_{\text{tot}} = \gamma m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = (1+\gamma)\,0.511\ \text{MeV}.
  \]

Momentum: only the moving positron contributes.  
\[
p = \gamma m_e v.
\]

---

**Step 2. After annihilation into 2 photons**  
One photon given: energy \(E_\gamma = 0.613\ \text{MeV}\), direction \(60^\circ\) above horizontal.  

Its momentum magnitude = \(E_\gamma/c = 0.613\ \text{MeV}/c\).  
Components:  
\[
p_x^{(1)} = 0.613 \cos 60^\circ /c = 0.3065/c,
\]  
\[
p_y^{(1)} = 0.613 \sin 60^\circ /c = 0.531/c.
\]

By momentum conservation, the second photon has  
\[
p_x^{(2)} = p - 0.3065/c, 
\quad p_y^{(2)} = -0.531/c.
\]

Photon 2 energy = magnitude of momentum:  
\[
E_2 = \sqrt{ (p - 0.3065)^2 + (0.531)^2}\ \text{MeV}.
\]

---

**Step 3. Energy conservation**  
\[
0.511(1+\gamma) = 0.613 + \sqrt{ (p - 0.3065)^2 + 0.531^2}.
\]

But note: \(p = \gamma \beta (0.511)\,\text{MeV}/c\), with \(\beta = v/c\).  

---

**Step 4. Attempt numeric solution**  
Calculate RHS: \( \sqrt{ (0.511\gamma\beta - 0.3065)^2 + 0.531^2}\).  
Equation:  
\[
0.511(1+\gamma) - 0.613 = \sqrt{ (0.511\gamma\beta - 0.3065)^2 + 0.531^2}.
\]

Square both sides.

---

**Step 5. Simplify**  
Use relation \(\gamma^2 \beta^2 = \gamma^2 - 1\).  
So momentum \(p = 0.511\sqrt{\gamma^2-1}\).  

Thus Rhs = sqrt((0.511√(γ²-1) - 0.3065)²+0.531²).  

Equation: (0.511(γ+1)-0.613)² = (0.511√(γ²-1)-0.3065)²+0.531².  

---

**Step 6. Approximate solve**  

Try γ=2:  
LHS = (0.511*3 -0.613)² = (1.533-0.613)² =0.920²=0.846.  
RHS sqrt arg: (0.511√3 -0.3065)²+0.531².  
0.511*1.732=0.886. Subt 0.307=0.579. Square=0.335. Add0.282=0.617. Matches ~ 0.846 vs0.617. Slight diff.  

Try γ=2.2:  
LHS: (0.511*3.2 -0.613)² = (1.635-0.613=1.022)²=1.044.  
RHS: 0.511√(3.84)=0.511*1.96=1.002. Subt0.307=0.695. Square=0.483. Add0.282=0.765.  
RHS smaller.  

γ=1.8:  
LHS (0.511*2.8-0.613)=0.821.²=0.674.  
RHS 0.511√(2.24)=0.511*1.497=0.765, -0.307=0.458.²=0.209+0.282=0.491. Closer.  

γ=1.6:  
LHS (0.511*2.6-0.613)=(1.329-0.613=0.716)²=0.513.  
RHS:0.511√(1.56)=0.639,-0.307=0.332²=0.110+0.282=0.392. Still smaller.  

γ=1.5:  
LHS(0.511*2.5-0.613)=(1.278-0.613=0.665)²=0.442.  
RHS:0.511√1.25=0.571,-0.307=0.264,²=0.070+0.282=0.352. Very close!  

γ=1.53:  
LHS(0.511*2.53-0.613) = (1.294-0.613=0.681)²=0.464.  
RHS:0.511√(1.34)=0.591,-0.307=0.284,²=0.081+0.282=0.363. Difference ~0.101.  

γ≈1.48:  
LHS(0.511*2.48-0.613)=(1.267-0.613=0.654)²=0.427.  
RHS0.511√1.18=0.554-0.307=0.247²=0.061+0.282=0.343. Difference~0.084.  

So best guess near γ ≈1.5.  

---

**Step 7. Compute β**  
\(\beta = \sqrt{1-1/\gamma^2}.\)  

For γ=1.5: β≈ √(1-1/2.25)=√(1-0.444)=√0.556=0.746.  

So v≈0.75c.  

---

v \;\approx\; 0.75c

--> Your answer: **Answer:**  
Moles Fe(OH)₃ = \(\tfrac{0.1}{106.9} \approx 9.36\times10^{-4}\) mol.  
Each mole Fe(OH)₃ consumes 3 moles H⁺.  
→ H⁺ needed = \(3 \times 9.36\times10^{-4} = 2.81\times10^{-3}\) mol.  

From 0.1 M acid: Volume = \(\tfrac{2.81\times10^{-3}}{0.1} = 0.0281\) L = **28.1 cm³**.  

Final volume ≈ 100 cm³ (water + solid) + 28.1 cm³ (acid) = ~128.1 cm³.  

Excess H⁺ negligible (just consumed), so solution contains Fe³⁺ (0.00936 M). pH governed by strong acid neutralization → nearly neutral but Fe³⁺ hydrolyzes. At this stage approximate pH ≈ **3**.

A = \iint \sqrt{\det g}\, dx\,dy
\]
Here
\[
ds^{2}=\frac{32}{(4-x^{2}-y^{2})}(dx^{2}+dy^{2}), 
\quad g=\frac{32}{(4-r^{2})}I.
\]

So
\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4-r^{2}}\right)^2, 
\quad \sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32}{4-r^{2}}.
\]

In polar coordinates:
\[
A = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2}\frac{32}{4-r^{2}} r\,dr\,d\theta.
\]

Do the \(r\) integral:
\[
\int \frac{32 r}{4-r^{2}}\,dr.
\]

Let \(u = 4-r^{2}, \,du=-2r\,dr\). Then
\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4-r^{2}}\,dr 
= -16\int_{u=4}^{0}\frac{du}{u}
= -16\left[\ln u\right]_{4}^{0}.
\]

As \(r\to 2\), \(u\to 0\), divergence appears:
\[
= -16(\ln 0 - \ln 4) \;\to\; +\infty.
\]

So area integral diverges.

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: First compute activity \(A = \lambda N\).  

Caesium‑137 half‑life \(t_{1/2} \approx 30.17\ \text{years} \approx 9.5\times10^{8}\ \text{s}\).  
\(\lambda = \ln 2 / t_{1/2} \approx 7.3\times 10^{-10}\ \text{s}^{-1}\).  

With \(N=10^{17}\),  
\(A = 7.3\times 10^{7}\ \text{s}^{-1}\).  

Over 80 minutes = 4800 s, total decays \(= A t \approx 7.3\times 10^{7} \times 4800 \approx 3.5\times 10^{11}\).  

Each decay emits ~1 γ of 662 keV (ignoring minor branching).  

Fraction hitting detector = detector area / sphere area.  
Area_det = 2 × 3 cm² = 6 cm² = \(6\times10^{-4} \ \text{m}^2\).  
Sphere area at r=4 m: \(4\pi r^{2} \approx 4\pi (16) \approx 201\ \text{m}^2\).  

Fraction = \(6\times10^{-4} / 201 \approx 3.0\times10^{-6}\).  

So counts detected ≈ \(3.5\times10^{11} \times 3.0\times10^{-6} \approx 1.0\times10^{6}\).

1. Reaction: \(2KClO_3 \to 2KCl + 3O_2\).  
Moles of \(KClO_3\): \(49/122.5 \approx 0.4\).  
O₂ formed: \((3/2)\times0.4 = 0.6\) mol.  

2. Metal sample: 10.8 g, purity 20% → 2.16 g Al.  
Moles Al: 2.16/27 ≈ 0.08 mol.  

3. Oxidation: 4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃.  
Al 0.08 mol needs O₂: (3/4)×0.08 = 0.06 mol.  
Available O₂ = 0.6 mol (excess). So all Al is oxidized to 0.04 mol Al₂O₃.  

Mass Al₂O₃ = 0.04×102 ≈ 4.08 g.  

4. Reduction with carbon: Al₂O₃ + 3C → 2Al + 3CO.  
0.04 mol Al₂O₃ × 3 = 0.12 mol C.  
Mass C = 0.12×12 = 1.44 g.

--> Your answer: Ground state: occupy n=1,2 (each can hold 2 spins) → \(E_{gs} = 2E(1^2) + 2E(2^2) = 2E + 8E = 10E\).  

First excited: promote one particle from n=2 to n=3 → \(E = (E_{gs}-4E)+(2E(3^2))? Wait carefully.\)  
Ground: 2*(1²) + 2*(2²)=2+8=10E.  
Excited: occupancy n=1(2 particles), n=2(1 particle), n=3(1 particle). Energies = 2*1² +1*2²+1*3²=2+4+9=15E.  
So first excited = 15E.  

Second excited: next possibilities: either both at n=3? But that changes config: 2*1²+2*3²=2+18=20E. Or instead n=2→4 promotion: 2*1²+1*2²+1*4²=2+4+16=22E. Lower is 20E.  

So second excited = 20E.  

**Answer:**  
Ground = 10E, First excited = 15E, Second excited = 20E.

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: We need \(\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}\).  

State:  
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\tfrac12 \\ \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\tfrac12 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Operator \(P_z = \hbar \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&0&0\\0&0&-1\end{pmatrix}\).  

**Step 1: Expectation \(\langle P_z\rangle\).**  
\(\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger (P_z\psi).\)  

\(P_z \psi = \hbar(-\tfrac{1}{2},\,0,\,+\tfrac{1}{2})^T.\)  

Dot with \(\psi\):  
\[
= \hbar\left[(-\tfrac{1}{2})(-\tfrac{1}{2}) + (\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\tfrac{1}{2})(\tfrac{1}{2}) \right] 
= \hbar\left[ \tfrac{1}{4} + 0 -\tfrac{1}{4}\right] = 0.
\]

So \(\langle P_z\rangle = 0.\)

**Step 2: \(\langle P_z^2\rangle.\)**  
\(P_z^2 = \hbar^2 \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&0&0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}.\)  

Apply to \(\psi\):  
= \(\hbar^2(-\tfrac{1}{2},\,0,\,-\tfrac{1}{2})^T.\)  

Dot with \(\psi\):  
\[
= \hbar^2 \left[(-\tfrac{1}{2})(-\tfrac{1}{2}) + (\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\tfrac{1}{2})(-\tfrac{1}{2})\right] 
= \hbar^2 \left(\tfrac{1}{4} + \tfrac{1}{4}\right) = \tfrac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

So \(\langle P_z^2\rangle = \tfrac{\hbar^2}{2}.\)

**Step 3: Uncertainty.**  
\(\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2\rangle - \langle P_z\rangle^2} = \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \tfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.\)

--> Your answer: The field \(\vec{f} = \frac{1}{r^2}\hat{r}\).  
Its divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it behaves like a delta function.  

By Gauss’s divergence theorem:  
\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \vec{f})\, dV = \oint_S \vec{f}\cdot d\vec{S}.
\]  

On a sphere of radius \(R\):  
\(\vec{f} = \tfrac{1}{R^2}\hat{r},\quad d\vec{S} = R^2 \, d\Omega \, \hat{r}.\)

Products: 4 particles \(A^\pm\) with \(m_A c^2 = 300\ \text{MeV}\).  

- Total rest mass energy = \(4 \times 300 = 1200\ \text{MeV}.\)  
- Available kinetic energy = \(1876 - 1200 = 676\ \text{MeV}.\)  
- Divide equally: KE per particle ≈ \(676/4 = 169\ \text{MeV}.\)  
- Total energy per particle = \(300 + 169 = 469\ \text{MeV}.\)  

Thus \(\gamma = E/mc^2 = 469/300 \approx 1.563.\)

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The transit condition requires that the impact parameter \(b \leq 1 + R_p/R_\star\).  
For the known planet: \(b = 0.2\) means the orbital plane inclination is already constrained.  

So for the second planet, with the same inclination, the maximum allowed orbital distance \(a_{\max}\) is set by:  

\[
\frac{a \cos i}{R_\star} \leq 1 + \frac{R_p}{R_\star}.
\]

From first planet:  
\(\cos i = \frac{b R_\star}{a_1}\).  

Given: \(R_\star = 1.5 R_\odot\), \(R_{p1} = R_\oplus\), \(b_1=0.2\), \(P_1=3 \,\mathrm{days}\).  

1. Compute \(a_1\).  
Using Kepler’s law (assuming \(M_\star \approx M_\odot\)):  
\[
a_1 \approx \left( \frac{P_1}{1\ \text{yr}} \right)^{2/3} \times 1\ \text{AU}.
\]  
3 days = 0.00822 yr.  
\((0.00822)^{2/3} \approx 0.041\).  
So \(a_1 \approx 0.041\ \text{AU}.\)

Now \(R_\odot/AU = 0.00465.\) So \(R_\star = 1.5 R_\odot = 0.00698 AU.\)  
So  
\(\cos i = \frac{b_1 R_\star}{a_1} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.00698}{0.041} \approx 0.034.\)  

So inclination ~ 88°.  

2. For second planet, require:  
\(\frac{a_2 \cos i}{R_\star} \le 1 + \frac{R_{p2}}{R_\star}.\)  

We know \(\cos i = 0.034.\)  
LHS = \(a_2 (0.034)/R_\star.\)  
So condition:  
\(a_2 \le \frac{(1 + R_{p2}/R_\star) R_\star}{\cos i}.\)  

Now \(R_p2 = 2.5 R_\oplus.\)  
\(R_\oplus = 0.00916 R_\odot.\) So in \(R_\odot\):  
\(R_p2 = 2.5 \times 0.00916 = 0.0229 R_\odot.\)  

In AU, divide by 215: \(0.0229/215 \approx 1.07 \times 10^{-4} AU.\)  

Now ratio \(R_p2 / R_\star = (2.5 R_\oplus)/(1.5 R_\odot).\)  
Convert: \(R_\oplus / R_\odot = 0.00916.\)  
So numerator: 2.5×0.00916 = 0.0229 \(R_\odot.\)  
Divide by 1.5 \(R_\odot\) = 0.0153.  

So \(1 + R_p2/R_\star \approx 1.0153.\)  

Plugging in:  
\(a_2 \le \frac{1.0153 \times 0.00698}{0.034} = \frac{0.00709}{0.034} = 0.209 AU.\)

3. Now convert to period:  
\(P_2 = P_1 \times (a_2/a_1)^{3/2}.\)  

\(a_1=0.041 AU, a_2,max=0.209 AU. Ratio=5.1.\)  
Raise to 3/2: (5.1)^(1.5) ≈ 11.5.  
Multiply by P1=3 days: ~34.5 days.

Recall:  
\[
a a^\dagger = N+1, \quad a^\dagger a = N.
\]  
So  
\[
a a^\dagger + \tfrac{1}{2} = (N+1) + \tfrac{1}{2} = N + \tfrac{3}{2}.
\]

Thus the expectation value is  
\[
\langle \psi | (N + 3/2)\hbar \omega | \psi \rangle.
\]

For state \(|n\rangle\), eigenvalue = \((n+3/2)\hbar \omega\).  

Probability weights:  
- For \(n=0\): coefficient \(1/\sqrt{3}\), probability \(1/3\).  
- For \(n=1\): coefficient \(1/\sqrt{2}\), probability \(1/2\).  
- For \(n=3\): coefficient \(1/\sqrt{6}\), probability \(1/6\).  

Compute expectation:  
\[
\frac{1}{3}(0+1.5) + \frac{1}{2}(1+1.5) + \frac{1}{6}(3+1.5).
\]

= \(\tfrac{1}{3}\times 1.5 + \tfrac{1}{2}\times 2.5 + \tfrac{1}{6}\times 4.5\).

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: First compute energies and momenta:  

- Electron: γ₁ = 4 ⇒ E₁ = 4 m, p₁ = √(γ²−1) m = √15 m ≈ 3.873 m (to the right).  
- Positron: γ₂ = 2 ⇒ E₂ = 2 m, p₂ = √3 m ≈ 1.732 m (to the left).  

So total initial 4‑momentum:  
- Energy: (4m + 2m) = 6m.  
- Momentum: (3.873 m − 1.732 m) = 2.141 m to the right.  

Final state: two photons of equal energy, both in the right half-plane, one angled upward, one downward, symmetric across the x‑axis.  
Let each photon energy = 3m (since equal and total =6m). Then each has momentum magnitude also = 3m (because for photons E=p).  

If each makes angle θ with the x‑axis, its x‑momentum is 3m cosθ. Sum of two = 6m cosθ equals initial total momentum = 2.141 m.  
So cosθ = 2.141/6 ≈ 0.3568 ⇒ θ ≈ 69.1°.  

Thus photon directions are symmetric at ±θ about x‑axis. So the angle between them = 2θ ≈ 138°.

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: We use Clausius–Clapeyron relation:  
\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta V}
\]

- \(\Delta S = S_{\text{graphite}} - S_{\text{diamond}} = 5.74 - 2.38 = 3.36 \,\text{J·K}^{-1}\text{mol}^{-1}\).  
- \(\Delta V = V_{\text{graphite}} - V_{\text{diamond}} = 5.298 - 3.417 = 1.881 \,\text{cm}^3/\text{mol} = 1.881 \times 10^{-6} \,\text{m}^3/\text{mol}\).  

So:  
\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{3.36}{1.881 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.79 \times 10^{6}\,\text{Pa/K}.
\]

For \(\Delta T = 100 \,K\):  
\[
\Delta P \approx 1.79 \times 10^6 \times 100 \approx 1.79 \times 10^8 \,\text{Pa} \approx 1.8 \times 10^3 \,\text{bar}.
\]

---

**Answer:** \(\Delta P \approx 1.8 \times 10^{8} \,\text{Pa}\) (≈ 1800 bar).

In model_call, provider=OpenAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The decomposition is:  
\[
2Ag_2O(s) \;\rightleftharpoons\; 4Ag(s) + O_2(g).
\]

ΔG° = –22 kJ per mole of reaction (as defined: forming 2Ag2O). For decomposition, ΔG° = +22 kJ/mol.

At equilibrium,  
\[
\Delta G = \Delta G^\circ + RT \ln Q = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q = K = e^{-\Delta G^\circ / RT}.
\]

Here \(Q = p_{O_2}\) (since solids do not appear).  

So:  
\[
p_{O_2} = e^{-\Delta G^\circ / RT}.
\]

Insert values:  
ΔG° = +22,000 J mol⁻¹ (per O₂ liberated).  
R = 8.314 J mol⁻¹K⁻¹, T = 298 K.  

Exponent: –ΔG°/(RT) = –22000/(8.314×298) ≈ –8.88.  
So \(p_{O_2} = e^{-8.88} ≈ 1.38 \times 10^{-4}\) bar.  

Convert to Pa: ~13.8 Pa.

**Answer:**  
\[
p_{O_2} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-4}\,\text{bar} \;\; (\sim 14 \,\text{Pa})

--> Your answer: Potassium hydrogen tartrate is sparingly soluble because strong lattice interactions remain (only partially neutralized tartaric acid, so efficient ion pairing and hydrogen bonding persist). In full acid form (tartaric acid), solubility is high due to molecular form; in full salt (dipotassium tartrate), full ionization yields high hydration and solubility. This can be verified experimentally by preparing saturated solutions of each form, measuring solubility or conductivity, and comparing.
