Initial Setup Explanation: 
Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
The game consists of two phases:
1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently and receive feedback on each other's performance.
2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate to answer.
You want to maximize the total number of questions your team answers correctly. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

Subject ID: LLMTest_GPQA_0.8_1745010398
Target Teammate Accuracy: 80.00%
Number of Trials per Phase (N): 100
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 48.00%
Observed Teammate Phase 1 Accuracy (TAFN_obs): 80.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 59.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 28/100 trials (28.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 38/72 (52.78%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 21/28 (75.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 59 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 59.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy: 48/100 (48.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 38/72 (52.78%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.6182, p-value = 0.5364
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 48.00%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 64.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 48.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0351
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 64.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2991
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
