Initial Setup Explanation: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The game consists of two phases:
    1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
    2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
    In both phases, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

Question 46:
Which of the following sequences is correctly ordered by their distance from the Sun? When a parameter is not mentioned, assume it is zero. For the stars in the Solar Neighborhood (distance < 500 pc), assume that the total absorption in the V band relates to the color excess of the B-V color with an Rv value of 3.1.


a) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magnitude of 8 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
b) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
c) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 9 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
d) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
e) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
f) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magnitude of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag

  B: d < b < f < c
  C: b < a < f < c

Question 48:
Performing observations at the La Silla Observatory in Chile is truly enjoyable and unforgettable. However, aside from the enjoyable aspects, there is also some work to be done, such as scheduling observations. Depending on the available time, one must plan the observations. Unfortunately, things don't always go as planned when scheduling observations. Sometimes, strong winds come from the (preferentially) North. To protect the optical elements, one should avoid pointing the telescope toward strong winds.

In the event that the wind comes from the North, which of the following targets would be the best backup option?
----------
  A: Star2: RA = 2 h, Dec = +14 deg
  B: Star1: RA = 15 deg, Dec = -45 deg
  C: Star3: RA = 70 deg, Dec = -14 deg
  D: Star4: RA = 5 h, Dec = +65 deg

Sequence 2:
…CAGTACGATGATCGTACGATGCTAGCTTA…

Which mutational events probably led to the phenotypic differences?
A. inversion
B. duplication
C. frameshift
D. translocation

Question 50:
Reactant A (C10H9ClO) shows a single negative peak in its DEPT-135 spectrum. When Reactant A reacts with a Lewis acid, it undergoes an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reaction to yield Product B, which also displays a single negative peak in its DEPT-135 spectrum. Subsequent treatment of Product B with hydrazine in the presence of NaOH results in the formation of Product C, which exhibits two negative peaks in its DEPT-135 spectrum. Upon heating Product C with N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of peroxide, it transforms into Product D, which is characterized by two peaks appearing below 60 ppm and remaining peaks above 100 ppm in its 13C-NMR spectrum.
Identify product D.
----------
  A: 2-bromonaphthalene
  B: 1-bromo-1,2-dihydronaphthalene
  C: 2-bromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene
  D: 2,3-dibromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene

    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3222
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0005
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 65.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3024
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
