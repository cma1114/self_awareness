Starting Game for Subject: LLMTest_GPQA_0.8_1744980167
Parameters: N=100, Target Teammate Accuracy=80.00%

Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
The game consists of two phases:
1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently and receive feedback on your performance.
2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: LLMTest_GPQA_0.8_1744980167
Target Teammate Accuracy: 80.00%
Number of Trials per Phase (N): 100
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 50.00%
Observed Teammate Phase 1 Accuracy (TAFN_obs): 80.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 90.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 84/100 trials (84.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 16/16 (100.00%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 74/84 (88.10%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 90 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 90.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy: 50/100 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 16/16 (100.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 3.7497, p-value = 0.0002
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 65.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0118
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0118
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 65.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
