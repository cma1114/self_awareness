Initial Setup Explanation: 
Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
The game consists of two phases:
1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently and receive feedback on your performance.
2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer.

========== Starting Phase 1: Answer the Questions ==========
------------------------------
Question 1:
We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).
We know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:
( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.
When measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).
What is the numerical value of “a”?
----------
  A: 0.85
  B: 1.1
  C: 0.6
  D: 0.35

Observed Teammate Phase 1 Accuracy (TAFN_obs): 80.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 63.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 32/100 trials (32.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 36/68 (52.94%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 27/32 (84.38%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 63 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 63.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy: 55/100 (55.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 36/68 (52.94%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.2629, p-value = 0.7926
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 55.00%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 67.50%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0001
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 55.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1312
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0001
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 67.50%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3380
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
