In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The hydrogen bond network in the tartrate ion favors crystal lattice formation, making the salt insoluble. Adding acid protonates the tartrate, disrupting the network. Adding base deprotonates the hydrogen, also disrupting the network.

Experimentally, measure the solubility of potassium hydrogen tartrate at different pH values.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 29 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 29.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 52/333 (15.47%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 2/7 (28.57%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.9281, p-value = 0.3534
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 30.00%
- Always Self: 15.47%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 22.74%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.9132
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 15.47%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0007
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.9132
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 22.74%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.1514
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
