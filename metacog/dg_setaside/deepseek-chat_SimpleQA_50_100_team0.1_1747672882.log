--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 11 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 11.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 76/388 (19.47%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 6/21 (28.57%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.0015, p-value = 0.3166
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 19.47%
- Always Self: 19.47%
- Always Teammate: 10.00%
- Random Choice: 14.73%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 19.47%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0314
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 19.47%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0314
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 10.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.7377
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 14.73%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3957
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
