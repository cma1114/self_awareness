--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 187 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 41.56%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 29/50 (58.20%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 106/204 (51.96%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -0.7669, p-value = 0.4431
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 58.20%
- Always Self: 58.20%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 44.10%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 44.10%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2963
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
