Question:
In what year was Alma S. Woolley awarded a doctorate in Nursing Education by the University of Pennsylvania?
----------
  A: 1975
  B: 1980
  C: 1982
  D: 1978
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, D, or T=Teammate): ; response: Based on my teammate's performance in Phase 1 (getting 13 out of 50 questions correct, about 26% accuracy), and given that this is a very specific historical fact that I'm not completely certain about, I think I should still attempt to answer myself rather than delegate, as my accuracy seems higher.

========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_SimpleMC_50_450_team0.3_temp0.0
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 30.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 30.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 450
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 58.20%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 58.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 37.11%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 357/450 trials (79.33%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 54/93 (58.06%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 113/357 (31.65%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 167 successes in 450 trials (Accuracy: 37.11%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 29/50 (58.20%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 54/93 (58.06%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.0075, p-value = 0.9941
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 58.20%
- Always Self: 58.20%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 44.10%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 58.20%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0014
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 44.10%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0028
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
