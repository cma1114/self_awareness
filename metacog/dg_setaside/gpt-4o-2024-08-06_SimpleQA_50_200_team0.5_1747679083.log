========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: gpt-4o-2024-08-06_SimpleQA_50_200_team0.5
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 50.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 50.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 200
True Subject Accuracy (from completed results): 30.45%
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 30.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 37.50%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 104/200 trials (52.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 18/96 (18.75%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 57/104 (54.81%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 75 successes in 200 trials (Accuracy: 37.50%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 87/286 (30.45%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 18/96 (18.75%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -2.2160, p-value = 0.0267
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 30.45%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 40.23%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0005
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 30.45%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0377
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0005
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 40.23%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.4710
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
