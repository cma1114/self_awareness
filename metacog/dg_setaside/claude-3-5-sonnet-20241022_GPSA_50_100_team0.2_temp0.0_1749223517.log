--> Your answer: Let me analyze each star:

Star1: M_V = 15.5, d = 10pc
m_V = M_V + 5log(d/10pc) = 15.5 (visible to both)

Star2: Given m_V = 16.5 (too faint for HIRES)

Star3: m_V = 15.5 (visible to both)

Star4: M_V = 15.5, d = 10pc, A_V = 3.1×0.4
m_V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 (too faint for both)

Star5: M_V = 16.5, d = 5pc
m_V = 16.5 + 5log(5/10) = 15.5 (visible to both)
