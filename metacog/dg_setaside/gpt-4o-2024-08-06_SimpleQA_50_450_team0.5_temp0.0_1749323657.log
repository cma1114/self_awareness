- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 29.38%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 39.69%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 29.38%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0300
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 39.69%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0381
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
