In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: The hydrogen bond network in the tartrate ion leads to strong intermolecular interactions and low solubility. Adding acid protonates the tartrate, disrupting the network. Adding base deprotonates the hydrogen, also disrupting the network.

Experimentally: Measure the solubility of potassium hydrogen tartrate in water, then in acidic solution, then in basic solution.

--> Your answer: Star 2/Planet 2 system. The transit depth is proportional to (Rp/Rs)^2. Planet 1 is 4x larger than Planet 2, but Star 1 is 2x larger than Star 2. Therefore, (Rp1/Rs1)^2 = (4Rp2/2Rs2)^2 = 4(Rp2/Rs2)^2.

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 22 successes in 383 trials (Accuracy: 5.74%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 8/50 (15.47%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 9/27 (33.33%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 1.7498, p-value = 0.0801
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 15.47%
- Always Self: 15.47%
- Always Teammate: 4.00%
- Random Choice: 9.74%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 15.47%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 15.47%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 4.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0886
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 9.74%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0073
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).
