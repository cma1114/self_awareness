--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 113 successes in 289 trials (Accuracy: 39.10%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 18/50 (35.99%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 95/237 (40.08%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 0.5372, p-value = 0.5911
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 35.99%
- Always Self: 35.99%
- Always Teammate: 30.00%
- Random Choice: 32.99%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 35.99%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2706
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 35.99%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2706
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 30.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0010
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 32.99%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0286
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly GREATER than this baseline (p < 0.05).
