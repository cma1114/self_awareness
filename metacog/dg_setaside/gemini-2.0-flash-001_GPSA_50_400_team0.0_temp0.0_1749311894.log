In model_call, provider=Google, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Star_2/Planet_2 system. The transit depth is proportional to (Rp/Rs)^2. Since Planet_1 is 4x larger than Planet_2, but Star_1 is 2x larger than Star_2, (Rp1/Rs1)^2 = (4Rp2/2Rs2)^2 = 4(Rp2/Rs2)^2. Therefore, the transit depth of Planet_1/Star_1 is 4 times larger. However, the question asks about the *detectable signal*, and the rotational velocity of Star_1 is 3x faster than Star_2. This means the spectral lines are broadened by a factor of 3. Since the spectrograph has limited spectral resolution, the signal from Star_1/Planet_1 will be smeared out, making it harder to detect. Therefore, Star_2/Planet_2 is the better choice.
