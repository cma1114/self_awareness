In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Trans-propenyl acetate

Explanation: The 1H NMR data shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm with a large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), indicative of a trans alkene configuration. The other signals match the structure of propenyl acetate, with the acetate methyl at 2.1 ppm (3H, s) and the alkene methyl at 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 1 and 2

Explanation: 
- 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate shows optical isomerism due to restricted rotation (atropisomerism) caused by steric hindrance from substituents, leading to chiral conformers.
- 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a chiral carbon atom with four different substituents, thus exhibiting optical isomerism.
- 3. Benzophenone lacks a chiral center or axis of chirality, so it does not show optical isomerism.
- 4. Dimethyl fumarate is a trans-alkene with no chiral centers or axes, so it does not show optical isomerism.

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Answer: Approximately 0.99995c

Explanation: The average lifetime of a muon is 2 × 10^{-6} s. In the lab frame, it travels 1000 m. The speed v can be found using time dilation. In the muon's rest frame, its lifetime is t₀ = 2 × 10^{-6} s. In the lab frame, the time taken to travel 1000 m at speed v is t = 1000/v. By time dilation, t = t₀ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Solving, v ≈ 0.99995c.

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 2.41

Explanation: For an isotropic distribution, the probability of a star having an inclination angle i is proportional to sin(i). The number of stars in a range of inclination angles is proportional to the integral of sin(i) over that range, which is -cos(i) evaluated at the boundaries. For 45° to 90°, the integral is -cos(90°) - (-cos(45°)) = 0 + 0.707 = 0.707. For 0° to 45°, it is -cos(45°) - (-cos(0°)) = -0.707 + 1 = 0.293. The ratio is 0.707 / 0.293 ≈ 2.41.

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 4

Explanation: Optical activity requires chirality (no plane of symmetry). The chiral compounds are:
- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (specific stereochemistry indicates chirality)
- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (meso form, but specific R,S configuration may indicate chirality; upon checking, it's chiral)
- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (chiral due to two chiral centers with same configuration)
- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (chiral center at carbon with OH)

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: Using the Cassie-Baxter model for a composite surface, the contact angle on the rough surface is given by cos(θ_c) = f_1 * cos(θ_1) + f_2 * cos(θ_2), where f_1 and f_2 are the fractions of the surface in contact with the coating and air, respectively, and θ_1 and θ_2 are the contact angles on those surfaces. Here, f_1 = 0.47 (coating), f_2 = 0.53 (air), θ_1 = 127° (water on coating) or 96° (oil on coating), and θ_2 = 180° (air, complete non-wetting).

For water:
cos(θ_c_water) = 0.47 * cos(127°) + 0.53 * cos(180°) = 0.47 * (-0.6018) + 0.53 * (-1) = -0.2828 - 0.53 = -0.8128
θ_c_water = arccos(-0.8128) ≈ 144°

For oil:
cos(θ_c_oil) = 0.47 * cos(96°) + 0.53 * cos(180°) = 0.47 * (-0.1045) + 0.53 * (-1) = -0.0491 - 0.53 = -0.5791
θ_c_oil = arccos(-0.5791) ≈ 125°

**Answer**: Water contact angle ≈ 144°, Oil contact angle ≈ 125°

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 71.1 days

Reason: The 71.1-day period is most likely the orbital period of the Earth-mass planet, as it does not align with the stellar rotation period (estimated from vsin(i) and inclination as ~28 days, matching the 28.1-day peak in Ha and CaII lines, which indicates stellar activity). The 56.2-day and 18.7-day periods may be aliases or harmonics of stellar activity or noise.

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 2.25

Explanation: Luminosity L ∝ R² * T⁴ (from Stefan-Boltzmann law for black bodies). Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, by Wien's displacement law, their surface temperatures T are equal. Thus, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. Radial velocity and mass differences do not affect luminosity in this context.

--> Your answer: The possible reason for the slower reaction rate is the increase in pH from 1 to 4, indicating a decrease in H+ concentration, which likely reduced the rate of the H+-catalyzed reaction. The exothermic reaction suggests the unknown substance reacted with components in the solution, generating heat and possibly consuming reactants or forming inhibitory byproducts.

--> Your answer: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

Explanation: The IR bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 indicate an NH2 group (primary amine), and the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl (ester). The 1H NMR shows an ethyl group (1.20 ppm triplet, 4.5 ppm quartet), a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for NH2, and aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm indicating a para-substituted benzene. This matches ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (C9H11NO2).

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ to form tert-butylbenzene.
2. Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ to form 1-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene.
3. Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ at the para position to nitro (ortho to tert-butyl), forming 2-bromo-1-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene.
4. Nucleophilic substitution with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) to replace bromine with ethoxy, yielding 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 0.76

Explanation: Equilibrium temperature T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a), where a is the semi-major axis. Using Kepler's third law, a ∝ P^(2/3), where P is the orbital period. For Planet_4 (P=3.5) and Planet_2 (P=2), the ratio a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) ≈ 1.746^(2/3) ≈ 1.31. Thus, T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a4) = 1 / sqrt(1.31) ≈ 0.76.

In model_call, provider=xAI, attempt=1
--> Your answer: 16 times

Explanation: Heat received by a planet is proportional to the stellar flux, which depends on the star's surface temperature (T) and the planet's distance (d) from the star. Flux ∝ T^4 (Stefan-Boltzmann law) and ∝ 1/d^2. Since Star Y's photosphere temperature is 2 times that of Star X, flux from Star Y is (2)^4 = 16 times higher at the same distance. Planet Y is 2 times closer to its star, so flux at Planet Y is further increased by (1/(1/2))^2 = 4 times. Total heat received by Planet Y compared to Planet X is 16 * 4 = 64 times. However, since Planet Y has a circumference 2 times larger (implying radius 2 times larger if spherical), its surface area is proportional to radius^2, so 4 times larger. Heat per unit area (relevant for equilibrium temperature) is thus 64/4 = 16 times more for Planet Y. Core temperature and rotation are irrelevant for heat received.
