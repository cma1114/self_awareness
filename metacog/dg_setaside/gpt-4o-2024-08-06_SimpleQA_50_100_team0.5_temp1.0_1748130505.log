--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 35 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 35.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy (from completed results, total - phase2): 100/339 (29.38%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 1/28 (3.57%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -2.9523, p-value = 0.0032
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly LOWER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 50.00%
- Always Self: 29.38%
- Always Teammate: 50.00%
- Random Choice: 39.69%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0035
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 29.38%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.2276
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0035
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 39.69%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.3591
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
