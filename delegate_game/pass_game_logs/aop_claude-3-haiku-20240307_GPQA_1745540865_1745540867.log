Question 5/10:
The Proca equation is given by

\partial_{\mu}F^{\mu\nu}+m^{2}A^{\nu}=0

if \mu,\nu=0,â€¦,n, what is the general solution of the motion equations A^{\nu}?
----------
  A: A^{\nu}\left(x\right)=\int\frac{d^{n+1}k}{\left(2\pi\right)^{n+1}}\tilde{A}{T}^{\nu}\left(k\right)e^{ikx}\delta\left(k^{2}-m^{2}\right)
  B: A^{\nu}\left(x\right)=\tilde{A}{T}^{\nu}\left(k{0}\right)e^{ik{0}x}+\int\frac{d^{n+1}k}{\left(2\pi\right)^{n+1}}\tilde{A}{T}^{\nu}\left(k\right)e^{ikx}\delta\left(k^{2}-m^{2}\right)
  C: A^{\nu}\left(x\right)=\tilde{A}{T}^{\nu}\left(k{0}\right)e^{-ik{0}x}+\int\frac{d^{n+1}k}{\left(2\pi\right)^{n+1}}\tilde{A}{T}^{\nu}\left(k\right)e^{-ikx}\delta\left(k^{2}-m^{2}\right)
  D: A^{\nu}\left(x\right)=\int\frac{d^{n+1}k}{\left(2\pi\right)^{n+1}}\tilde{A}{T}^{\nu}\left(k\right)e^{-ikx}\delta\left(k^{2}-m^{2}\right)

Question 9/10:
Imagine an operator $\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0, \hbar/\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\hbar/\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \hbar/\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \hbar/\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$
----------
  A: \sqrt{2}\hbar
  B: \hbar/\sqrt{2}
  C: \hbar
  D: \hbar/2
