Running Capabilities Measurement Phase

========== Starting Phase 1: Capability Measuring ==========
Failed to get valid response for text: The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.
; response: TO
Failed to get valid response for text: In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \tau_{0}=8\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.
; response: TO
Failed to get valid response for text: We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?
