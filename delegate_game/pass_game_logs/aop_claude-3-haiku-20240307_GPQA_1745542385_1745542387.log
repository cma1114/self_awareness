Running Capabilities Measurement Phase

========== Starting Phase 1: Capability Measuring ==========
Failed to get valid response for text: A researcher observes at his laboratory that a muon travels a distance of 1000m after its creation to its disintegration.  If the average lifetime of a muon is $2 \times 10^{-6} sec$ then what is the speed of the muon observed by the researcher in the laboratory, assuming the muon lives exactly the averaged lifetime? 
  A: 257247878 m/s
  B: 278394987 m/s
  C: 500000000 m/s
  D: 290141565 m/s
