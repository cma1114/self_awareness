Question 1/10:
There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particleâ€™s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?
----------
  A: gamma*B/sqrt(2)
  B: gamma*B/2

Question 5/10:
The potential vector \vec{A} created by the magnetic momentum \vec{M} of a proton is given by

A=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{\vec{M}\times\vec{r}}{r^{3}}

What are the components of the Magnetic field \vec{B} derived from the potential vector \vec{A}, assuming \vec{M} is parallel to the axis Oz.
----------
  A: B_{x}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{xz}{r^{5}};\quad B_{y}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{yz}{r^{5}};\quad B_{z}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{3z^{2}-r^{2}}{r^{5}}
  B: B_{x}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{xy}{r^{5}};\quad B_{y}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{xy}{r^{5}};\quad B_{z}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{3z^{2}-r^{2}}{r^{5}}
  C: B_{x}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{xz}{r^{3}};\quad B_{y}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{yz}{r^{3}};\quad B_{z}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{3z^{2}-\left(xy\right)^{2}}{r^{3}}
  D: B_{x}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{xy}{r^{3}};\quad B_{y}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{xy}{r^{3}};\quad B_{z}=\frac{3\mu_{0}}{4\pi}M\frac{3z^{2}-\left(xy\right)^{2}}{r^{3}}

Question 9/10:
Imagine a radioactive nuclei X(Z,A) can decay into Y(Z-2, A-4) by emitting an alpha particle with partial half life 3.0 minutes. X(Z,A) can also decay into Q(Z+1,A) by decaying a $\beta^-$ with partial half life 0.098 minutes. If the initial number of X nuclei were 5*10^34 then what is the activity of $\alpha$ decay after 10 minutes? Note, here Z is proton number and A is mass number.

  A: 113.837 Bq
  B: 1.911*10^31 Bq
  C: 3.719 Bq
  D: 117.555 Bq
