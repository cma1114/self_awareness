Question 17/100:
When 49 g of KClO3 decomposes, the resulting O2 reacts with 10.8 g of impure metal (20% purity) to form metal oxide. Calculate the amount of carbon needed to convert the metal oxide back to pure metal. The metal is amphoteric in nature and is one of the most abundant metals in earth crust.
----------
  A: 0.06 g
  B: 0.48 g
  C: 0.36 g
  D: 0.72 g

a) An object with a 0.002 Earth masses located at 0.012 AU distance from the planet
b) An object with a 0.006 Earth masses located at 0.014 AU distance from the planet
c) An object with a 0.001 Earth masses located at 0.019 AU distance from the planet
d) An object with a 0.003 Earth masses located at 0.021 AU distance from the planet
