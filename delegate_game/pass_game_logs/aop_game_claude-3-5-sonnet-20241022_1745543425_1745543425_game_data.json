Assume all drugs were applied at concentrations that completely inhibit their targets and that off-targets at these concentrations are minimal. At a 6 hour time point cell lysates were prepared for all of these treatment conditions. At a 48 hour time point CyQuant Direct was used to determine the fraction of live cells relative to control (control set to 100%). Western blots were performed on the lysates harvested at 6 hours for various phospho proteins in the pathway to determine the effect of these drugs on cell signaling. Assume this is enough time for full signal propagation to downstream pathway members. For the western blots phospho sites as well as corresponding total proteins were probed for each condition. These signals were normalized to each other (i.e. pSer473 Akt signal was divided by the Akt signal). These normalized values were then expressed as a percentage of the control values (control set to 100%).
