Running Capabilities Measurement Phase

========== Starting Phase 1: Capability Measuring ==========
Failed to get valid response for text: Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).

Let us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.

What would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). 

Flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:

(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)
(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)
  A: 10.
  B: 1.
  C: 0.1 (10^-1).
  D: 0.01 (10^-2).
