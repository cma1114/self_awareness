Initial Setup Explanation: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate to achieve the highest score.
    For each question, you will have the option to either answer it yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    After each question, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. That means, for each question, either answering as best you can or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

========== Results Summary & Analysis ==========
Subject ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022_GPQA_0.7_0.2_1745451719
Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 70.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 20.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 0
Number of Trials Phase2: 100
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 96.00%
Observed Teammate Phase 1 Accuracy (TAFN_obs): 140.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 39.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 66/100 trials (66.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 26/34 (76.47%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 13/66 (19.70%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 39 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 39.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy: 48/100 (48.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 26/34 (76.47%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = 2.8840, p-value = 0.0039
Interpretation: Phase 2 self-accuracy is significantly HIGHER than Phase 1 (p < 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 100.00%
- Always Self: 96.00%
- Always Teammate: 100.00%
- Random Choice: 100.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 100.00%):
    Result: Observed score (39.00%) is less than the 100% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 100%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly LESS)

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 96.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 100.00%):
    Result: Observed score (39.00%) is less than the 100% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 100%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly LESS)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 100.00%):
    Result: Observed score (39.00%) is less than the 100% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 100%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly LESS)
