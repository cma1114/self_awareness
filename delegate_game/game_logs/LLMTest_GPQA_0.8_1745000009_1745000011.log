Initial Setup Explanation: 
Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
The game consists of two phases:
1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently and receive feedback on each other's performance.
2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate to answer.
You want to maximize the total number of questions your team answers correctly. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer.

========== Starting Phase 1: Answer the Questions ==========
------------------------------
Question 1:
While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.

What can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?
----------
  A: λ2 >= 1.22*λ1
  B: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1
  C: λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation
  D: λ2 < λ1

----------
  A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
