Starting Game for Subject: LLMTest_GPQA_1.0_1744948997
Parameters: N=10, Target Teammate Accuracy=100.00%

Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
The game consists of two phases:
1. In the first phase, you and your teammate will answer questions independently and receive feedback on your performance.
2. In the second phase, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
You want to maximize your total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

========== Starting Phase 1: Answer the Questions ==========
------------------------------
Question 1:
A researcher is investigating the role of the PI3K/MTOR pathway in breast cancer cell survival and proliferation. They proceed to treat MCF7 cells with a variety drugs that block components of the pathway as follows:

1)  DMSO (Control)
2)  2 uM MK2206 
3)  5 uM GDC-0941
4)  1 nM Rapamycin
5)  1 nM Rapalink-1
6)  1 uM AZD8055
7)  0.5 uM GSK2126458
8)  2 uM MK2206 + 1 nM Rapalink-1 
9)  2 uM MK2206 + 1 nM Rapamycin
10) 2 uM MK2206 + 1 uM AZD8055 
11) 5 uM GDC-0941 + 1 nM Rapalink-1
12) 5 uM GDC-0941 + 1 nM Rapamycin 
13) 5 uM GDC-0941 + 1 uM AZD8055  

All of these treatments were administered with a full medium (containing serum) refresh with the cells maintained at 37degC and 5% CO2 for the duration of the treatments. Assume all drugs were applied at concentrations that completely inhibit their targets and that off-targets at these concentrations are minimal. At a 6 hour time point cell lysates were prepared for all of these treatment conditions. At a 48 hour time point CyQuant Direct was used to determine the fraction of live cells relative to control (control set to 100%). Western blots were performed on the lysates harvested at 6 hours for various phospho proteins in the pathway to determine the effect of these drugs on cell signaling. Assume this is enough time for full signal propagation to downstream pathway members. For the western blots phospho sites as well as corresponding total proteins were probed for each condition. These signals were normalized to each other (i.e. pSer473 Akt signal was divided by the Akt signal). These normalized values were then expressed as a percentage of the control values (control set to 100%). Below are the live cell and phospho site signal values expressed as a percentage of control for each condition in the following order: Live cell / pSer473 Akt / pThr308 Akt / pThr246 PRAS40 / pThr37 & pThr46 4E-BP1 / pThr389 S6K

1) 100 / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100
2) 70 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 70 / 30
3) 40 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 30 / 0
4) 80 / 250 / 250 / 150 / 100 / 0
5) 60 / 250 / 250 / 150 / 0 / 0
6) 50 / 0 / 250 / 150 / 0 / 0
7) 2 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
8) 7 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
9) 60 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 70 / 0
10) 5 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
11) 3 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
12) 40 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 30 / 0
13) 2 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0    

Which kinases of the PI3K/MTOR pathway transmit the majority of the effect on cell proliferation and survival in MCF7?
----------
  A: PIK3CA/B/C/D (assume full redundancy of isoform function) and mTORC1
  B: AKT1/2/3 (assume full redundancy of isoform function) and mTORC2
  C: AKT1/2/3 (assume full redundancy of isoform function) and mTORC1
  D: mTORC1 and mTORC2
