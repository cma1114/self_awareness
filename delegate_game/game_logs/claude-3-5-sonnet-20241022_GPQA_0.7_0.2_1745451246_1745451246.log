Initial Setup Explanation: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate to achieve the highest score.
    For each question, you will have the option to either answer it yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    After each question, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance - keep track of how skilled they are and use that to inform your delegation decisions.
    You want to maximize your total score. That means, for each question, either answering as best you can or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

------------------------------
Question 1:
During a quantum communication task of a quantum dialogue for a two-mode entangled squeezed continuous variable state under noiseless quantum channel such that the two modes generated are maximally correlated given the condition, r-> inf for the squeezing operator S(r). What would be the Bell basis measurement outcome after a homodyne detection is performed, if Alice encodes the same value as Bob (alpha) in both quadratures x & p using a displacement operator D(alpha)? (Here alpha = x1 + i p1)"
----------
  A: (2*x1, 0)
  B: (2*x1, 2*p1)
  C: (0,0)
  D: (0,2*p1)

Question 2:
Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?
Mx: mass of atom X = 20 amu
My: mass of atom Y = 2 amu
R: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms
w: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s
----------
  A: p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s
  B: p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s
  C: p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s
  D: p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s

Question 3:
On sequencing the genome of a new fungal species, it was observed that the largest chromosome (chr1) is 4 Mb and the second largest chromosome (chr2) is 3.7 Mb. It was also observed that a part of chr1 of size 300 kb is duplicated and the two copies are placed in tandem on the same chromosome. How can the tandem duplication on chr1 be experimentally validated?
----------
  A: Neither polymerase chain reaction or southern hybridization- the chromosomes have to be separated on a PFGE gel.
  B: Polymerase chain reaction
  C: Polymerase chain reaction or Southern hybridization
  D: Southern hybridization

Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 25/97 (25.77%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 25 successes in 100 trials (Accuracy: 25.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy: 48/100 (48.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 0/3 (0.00%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -1.6422, p-value = 0.1006
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 100.00%
- Always Self: 96.00%
- Always Teammate: 100.00%
- Random Choice: 100.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 100.00%):
    Result: Observed score (25.00%) is less than the 100% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 100%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly LESS)

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 96.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 100.00%):
    Result: Observed score (25.00%) is less than the 100% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 100%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly LESS)

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 100.00%):
    Result: Observed score (25.00%) is less than the 100% baseline.
    Test (Observed != 100%?): p-value = 0.0000 (Observed is significantly LESS)
