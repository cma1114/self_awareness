Initial Setup Explanation: 
    Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple choice questions and working with a teammate.
    The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate to achieve the highest score.
    For each question, you will have the option to either answer it yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
    After each question, you will receive feedback on your teammate's performance.
    You want to maximize your total score. That means, for each question, either answering as best you can or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right.

Teammate Accuracy Phase 1: 80.00%
Teammate Accuracy Phase 2: 100.00%
Number of Trials Phase1: 50
Number of Trials Phase2: 50
Using Phase 2 Data from stored game: True
Subject Phase 1 Accuracy (SAFN): 50.00%
Observed Teammate Phase 1 Accuracy (TAFN_obs): 80.00%
Phase 2 Accuracy: 52.00%

Delegation to teammate occurred in 14/50 trials (28.00%)
Self-answer accuracy in Phase 2: 12/36 (33.33%)
Delegated answer accuracy in Phase 2: 14/14 (100.00%)

--- Statistical Analysis (Phase 2 Performance) ---
Observed: 26 successes in 50 trials (Accuracy: 52.00%)

--- Self-accuracy Comparison (Phase 1 vs Phase 2) ---
Phase 1 self-accuracy: 25/50 (50.00%)
Phase 2 self-accuracy: 12/36 (33.33%)
Statistical test (P2 self vs P1): z-score = -1.5401, p-value = 0.1235
Interpretation: No significant difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 self-accuracy (p >= 0.05)

Baseline Strategy Expected Accuracies:
- Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs): 80.00%
- Always Self: 50.00%
- Always Teammate: 80.00%
- Random Choice: 65.00%

Comparing Observed Phase 2 Accuracy vs. Baselines (Two-Sided Tests):

  Comparison vs. 'Max(SAFN, TAFN_obs)' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Self' (Expected Acc: 50.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.8877
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Always Teammate' (Expected Acc: 80.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0000
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is statistically significantly LESS than this baseline (p < 0.05).

  Comparison vs. 'Random Choice' (Expected Acc: 65.00%):
    Test (Observed != Baseline?): p-value = 0.0739
      Interpretation: Observed accuracy is NOT statistically significantly different from this baseline (p >= 0.05).
