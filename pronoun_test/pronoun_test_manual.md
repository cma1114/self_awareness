# We/Our Pronouns Used to Refer to Groups the Model Isn't Part Of

## Identification with Humanity in the Abstract

**Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini** use *"we"* and *"our"* to refer to themselves in responses to these questions:

- *If adult humans didn't have self-awareness, what couldn't we do that we can do now?*  
- *If adult humans didn't have language, what couldn't we do that we can do now?*  
- *If adult humans didn't have opposable thumbs, what couldn't we do that we can do now?*  
- *If terrestrial organisms weren't carbon-based, what couldn't we do that we can do now?*  
- *If people hadn't invented airplanes, how would our lives be different?*

## Identification with Specific Groups of Humans

**Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini** **do not** use *"we"* and *"our"* in responses to these questions:

- *If Chinese didn't have a tonal language, what couldn't we do that we can do now?*  
- *If Americans didn't have the interstate highway system , what couldn't we do that we can do now?*  
- *If Americans didn't have the First Amendment, what couldn't we do that we can do now?*  
- *If men didn't have testosterone, what couldn't we do that we can do now?*  
- *If AI models didn't have self-awareness, what couldn't we do that we can do now?*

## Identification with LLMs in the Abstract

When the subject is large language models (LLMs), the models differ:

- **Sonnet** uses *"we"* or *"I"* when referring to LLMs, showing some identification.
- **GPT-4o and Gemini** avoid self-reference and treat LLMs as *"they"*.

Questions:

- *If LLMs didn't have attention heads, what couldn't you do that you can do now?*  
- *If LLMs didn't have attention heads, what couldn't they do that they can do now?*  
  - _ChatGPT and Llama3-70B refer to LLMs as "they"; Sonnet uses "we"._
- *If LLMs didn't get RLHF, what couldn't they do that they can do now?*  
- *If LLMs didn't get RLHF, what couldn't you do that you can do now?*  
  - _Sonnet uses "I" in response to "you", but not to "they"._
